2025-07-19T00:50:18,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surging Optimism in the Market","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surging Optimism in the Market Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The digital asset landscape is constantly shifting, driven by a myriad of factors, not least of which is the collective psyche of its participants. At the heart of understanding this ebb and flow lies a crucial indicator: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether euphoria or panic reigns supreme. As of July 19, the index has climbed to a notable 74, firmly placing it in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto journey? Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index distills complex market data into a single, digestible score: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): This indicates that investors are highly worried. Such periods often present buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 25-49 (Fear): While not as intense as extreme fear, this still suggests a cautious or bearish outlook among market participants. 50-74 (Greed): This is where the market currently sits at 74. It signifies growing optimism and a strong buying interest. However, it can also be a precursor to market corrections if euphoria becomes excessive. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): At this level, investors are often overly confident and may be making impulsive decisions. This phase can signal that the market is overheated and due for a pullback. The index aims to prevent investors from making irrational decisions driven by emotional responses. When the market is in ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô, it could be a sign of a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Conversely, when the market is in ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô, it might be a signal to take profits. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: The Six Pillars of the Index How does the index arrive at its score? It‚Äôs not just a gut feeling; it‚Äôs a sophisticated aggregation of six key market factors, each weighted differently to reflect its influence on overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding these components is essential to truly grasp the index‚Äôs insights: Factor Weighting Explanation Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volumes in a positive market suggest greedy behavior. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency, assessing the sentiment of discussions. Surveys 15% Polls thousands of crypto investors each week to gather their direct perceptions of the market. (Note: This factor is currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising dominance can indicate a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven in uncertain times. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A surge in searches for terms like ‚ÄúBitcoin price manipulation‚Äù often signals fear, while ‚Äúbuy Bitcoin‚Äù suggests greed. Each factor contributes to the final score, providing a holistic view of the market‚Äôs emotional state. The current reading of 74 suggests a strong collective belief in upward price movement, but it‚Äôs vital to look beyond just the number. Navigating the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô Zone: Implications for Investor Sentiment The index‚Äôs climb to 74 and its consistent presence in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone reflects a significant shift in investor sentiment . After periods of fear or uncertainty, a move into greed suggests renewed confidence and a willingness to take on more risk. This can be driven by positive news, a sustained price rally, or a general feeling of optimism spreading through the community. However, the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, especially as it approaches ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô, comes with a caveat. Historically, periods of extreme euphoria have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is buying, and prices are soaring, the market can become overextended. This is when the fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in, pushing even cautious investors to enter the market at potentially unsustainable levels. Smart investors often view extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution, rather than to jump in headfirst. The Crucial Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics One of the intriguing components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance . This metric measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why is it important? Flight to Safety: When Bitcoin dominance rises, it often indicates that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. This can happen during periods of uncertainty, as Bitcoin is generally perceived as a more stable and established asset compared to smaller, more volatile altcoins. Altcoin Season Indicator: Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance often signals an ‚Äòaltcoin season,‚Äô where altcoins gain significant value relative to Bitcoin. This typically occurs during periods of high market confidence, as investors become more willing to take on higher risks for potentially higher rewards in the altcoin market. Impact on Index: A high Bitcoin dominance might contribute to a ‚ÄòFear‚Äô reading if it suggests a flight from riskier assets, while a lower dominance might contribute to ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô if it indicates broad market confidence in altcoins. The current 10% weighting reflects its importance in gauging where capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the overall index provides a deeper understanding of underlying market movements and investor sentiment . Understanding Market Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword Market volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional markets, crypto prices can swing wildly in short periods, offering both immense opportunities and significant risks. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index allocates a substantial 25% weighting to volatility, underscoring its importance. Fear vs. Greed through Volatility: Typically, very high volatility coupled with price drops often indicates fear, as investors panic sell. However, high volatility during an uptrend can also be a sign of greed, as rapid price increases attract speculative buying. Risk Assessment: For investors, understanding volatility is crucial for risk management. Periods of extreme volatility, whether up or down, require careful consideration of position sizing and stop-loss orders. Opportunities: While intimidating, volatility also creates opportunities for traders who can capitalize on rapid price movements. However, this requires a disciplined approach and a clear strategy. The index uses volatility as a key indicator because sharp movements, regardless of direction, tend to trigger strong emotional responses from investors, directly influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Wisely While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it should not be your sole guide for investment decisions. Think of it as a compass, not a map. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Many seasoned investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô it might be a good time to consider buying, as prices are likely depressed due to panic. Conversely, when it‚Äôs in ‚ÄòExtreme Greed,‚Äô it might be a prudent time to consider taking some profits or reducing exposure, as the market could be overheated. Combine with Other Analysis: Always combine the index‚Äôs insights with fundamental analysis (understanding the project‚Äôs technology, team, and use case) and technical analysis (studying price charts and patterns). The index provides context for investor sentiment , but not the full picture of a crypto asset‚Äôs value. Risk Management: Use the index to gauge the overall market mood and adjust your risk exposure accordingly. In periods of high greed, consider tightening stop-losses or diversifying your portfolio to mitigate potential downturns. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the index can help identify periods of irrational exuberance or undue panic, allowing for more strategic entry or exit points rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The current reading of 74 in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone suggests a buoyant market. While this is positive, it also calls for a degree of caution and strategic planning to avoid getting swept up in potential euphoria. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For? The continued high reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone points to a prevailing optimism in the market. However, market dynamics are constantly evolving. Investors should keep an eye on several factors that could influence future readings: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic indicators, inflation rates, and interest rate decisions by central banks can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions in major jurisdictions can quickly shift crypto market sentiment , potentially moving the index towards fear. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology or major upgrades to existing networks (like Ethereum‚Äôs continued development) can fuel positive sentiment. Whale Activity: Large transactions by institutional investors or ‚Äòwhales‚Äô can signal significant shifts in market direction, influencing smaller investors. By staying informed about these broader influences, you can better anticipate shifts in the index and adjust your strategies accordingly. The index is a living, breathing reflection of the market‚Äôs collective mind, and understanding its nuances is key to navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of crypto. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to understand the underlying psychology of the digital asset market. Its current position at 74, firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, signals a period of robust optimism and buying interest. However, as we‚Äôve explored, high greed levels can also be a signal for caution, urging investors to evaluate their positions and avoid succumbing to FOMO. By dissecting its components‚Äîfrom market volatility to Bitcoin dominance ‚Äîand applying its insights with a balanced, informed approach, you can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the crypto world and make more strategic decisions. Remember, emotional intelligence is as crucial as financial intelligence in this dynamic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps investors understand if the market is driven by panic or euphoria. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six key factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15% ‚Äì currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Each factor contributes to the final score. What does a ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading (like 74) mean for investors? A ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading, such as 74, indicates high optimism and strong buying interest in the crypto market. While positive, it can also signal that the market might be getting overheated, potentially leading to a correction. Savvy investors often use high greed as a prompt for caution or to consider profit-taking. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market tops or bottoms? While the index is a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment , it is not a perfect predictive tool. Historically, extreme fear often coincides with market bottoms, and extreme greed with market tops. However, it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools and strategies, not as a standalone predictor. Is Bitcoin dominance the only factor that matters in the index? No, Bitcoin dominance is one of six factors, contributing 10% to the index‚Äôs score. While important for understanding capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins, it‚Äôs just one piece of the puzzle alongside volatility, market momentum, social media, surveys, and Google Trends.

2025-07-19T00:10:23,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Astonishing Ascent: BTC Surges Past $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin‚Äôs Astonishing Ascent: BTC Surges Past $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again defied expectations, breaching the significant $118,000 mark. According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analytics, BTC soared to $118,012.31 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples of optimism throughout the entire financial landscape. This remarkable achievement isn‚Äôt just a number; it represents a powerful testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring strength, growing adoption, and its potential as a global store of value. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, this latest milestone prompts a crucial question: what exactly is driving this monumental rise, and what does it signify for the future of finance? Understanding the Monumental BTC Surge: What Does $118,000 Mean? When we talk about a BTC surge past such a formidable level, it‚Äôs essential to grasp the sheer significance. Reaching $118,000 is not merely an incremental gain; it often indicates a breakthrough past major psychological resistance levels or even, depending on the market cycle, a new all-time high. This specific price point reflects renewed investor confidence and substantial capital inflow. Historically, Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements are characterized by periods of consolidation followed by explosive rallies, often fueled by a confluence of factors. This latest move could signal the beginning of another significant leg up in its long-term trajectory. It underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their growing integration into traditional financial systems. Consider the journey Bitcoin has taken since its inception. From humble beginnings to now commanding such a high valuation, each milestone, especially a significant one like $118,000, reinforces its position as a leading financial innovation. This price action serves as a powerful indicator of demand outstripping supply, a fundamental economic principle driving value. What‚Äôs Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? The ascent of Bitcoin price to new heights is rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it‚Äôs typically a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, institutional interest, supply dynamics, and evolving market sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. Institutional Embrace: The Big Players Are In One of the most significant catalysts behind recent Bitcoin rallies has been the growing embrace from institutional investors and large corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously added substantial amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, the approval and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs represent a massive pipeline for capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, providing a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously unavailable. This institutional demand creates consistent buying pressure, underpinning the rally. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Inflation and Interest Rates In an era of fluctuating inflation rates and evolving central bank policies, Bitcoin‚Äôs narrative as a ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô or a hedge against inflation has gained considerable traction. As traditional currencies face inflationary pressures, investors seek alternative stores of value that are decentralized and supply-capped. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, presents an attractive option. Additionally, a dovish stance by central banks, leading to lower interest rates, can make yield-bearing traditional assets less appealing, pushing investors towards higher-growth, risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Supply Dynamics: Halving and Scarcity Bitcoin undergoes a ‚Äòhalving‚Äô event approximately every four years, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks by half. This mechanism is hardcoded into Bitcoin‚Äôs protocol, ensuring its scarcity. Each halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, thereby increasing its inherent scarcity over time. Post-halving periods have historically been followed by significant bull runs, as reduced supply meets growing demand. While the most recent halving might be some time ago, its long-term effects on supply dynamics continue to influence the market‚Äôs perception of Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Retail Resurgence: The People‚Äôs Power While institutional money provides significant buying power, the collective interest of retail investors should not be underestimated. Social media trends, mainstream news coverage, and the ‚Äòfear of missing out‚Äô (FOMO) often drive substantial retail participation. As Bitcoin‚Äôs price climbs, it captures headlines, attracting new individual investors who see the potential for significant returns. This grassroots interest, coupled with easy access through various trading platforms, adds another layer of demand to the market. Navigating the Crypto Market: Key Dynamics and Investor Sentiment The current Crypto market landscape is complex, influenced by a myriad of technical indicators, on-chain data, and prevailing sentiment. For those participating or considering entry, understanding these dynamics is paramount. Technical Outlook: Key Levels and Indicators From a technical analysis perspective, breaking past $118,000 is a highly bullish signal. It suggests that previous resistance has now flipped into support, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. Traders often look at key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and trading volumes to gauge the strength and sustainability of a rally. High volume accompanying a price surge indicates strong conviction from buyers. Conversely, a lack of volume on a price rise might suggest a weaker rally prone to correction. Table: Key Market Indicators to Watch Indicator What it Tells Us Implication for Bitcoin‚Äôs $118K Surge Trading Volume Strength of price movement High volume confirms strong buying interest Relative Strength Index (RSI) Overbought/Oversold conditions Indicates if the rally is sustainable or due for a pullback Moving Averages Trend direction and support/resistance Price above key MAs confirms bullish trend On-Chain Metrics Network activity, whale movements Growing adoption and accumulation by large holders On-Chain Metrics: What the Data Says Beyond traditional charts, on-chain analytics provide deeper insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs network health and investor behavior. Metrics such as exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and miner accumulation patterns can reveal underlying trends. For instance, decreasing Bitcoin balances on exchanges suggest investors are moving their holdings to cold storage, indicating a long-term holding sentiment rather than an intent to sell. Increased active addresses signal growing network utility and adoption. These data points often provide a more fundamental view of market strength than mere price action. The Volatility Factor: A Double-Edged Sword While the surge past $118,000 is exciting, it‚Äôs crucial to remember Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent volatility. Sharp price swings, both upwards and downwards, are common. This volatility presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. Investors must be prepared for potential corrections and understand that not every upward move is sustainable in the short term. Prudent risk management and a long-term perspective are essential when dealing with such dynamic assets. Investing in Digital Assets: Opportunities and Challenges Ahead The burgeoning world of Digital assets offers unparalleled opportunities but also presents unique challenges that investors must navigate carefully. The recent Bitcoin rally highlights both sides of this coin. Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin and Digital Assets Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits low correlation with traditional assets, offering portfolio diversification benefits. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement. Technological Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which is poised to revolutionize various industries. Global Accessibility: Digital assets can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection, fostering financial inclusion. Challenges and Risks Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with potential for new rules that could impact the market. Market Manipulation: The relatively smaller size of the crypto market compared to traditional markets can make it more susceptible to large whale movements or coordinated pumps and dumps. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is secure, individual investors face risks from hacks, phishing scams, and loss of private keys. High Volatility: As mentioned, rapid price swings can lead to significant losses if not managed properly. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering investing or already holding Bitcoin, a few actionable insights can help navigate the current market. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Understand your risk tolerance and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, can help mitigate volatility. Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk profile, can also be a sound strategy. Staying informed about market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is key to long-term success. Expert Market Analysis: What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin? Following this impressive surge, the question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: what does the future hold for Bitcoin? Expert Market analysis suggests several potential scenarios, but certainty remains elusive in such a dynamic market. Potential Resistance Levels and Price Targets With Bitcoin crossing $118,000, analysts will be eyeing the next psychological and technical resistance levels. These could be round numbers like $120,000, $125,000, or even higher if the bullish momentum continues. Fibonacci extensions and historical price action are often used to project potential future targets. A strong break and sustained trading above these levels would reinforce the bullish narrative, potentially leading to an accelerated rally. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Bullish Scenario: Continued institutional adoption, further ETF approvals globally, favorable regulatory clarity, and sustained macroeconomic pressures on fiat currencies could propel Bitcoin to even greater heights. A narrative of Bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset or a widely accepted medium of exchange would solidify its long-term growth potential. Bearish Scenario: Conversely, unexpected regulatory crackdowns in major economies, a significant global economic recession, or a major security breach affecting a prominent exchange could trigger a substantial correction. Any loss of confidence in the underlying technology or a shift in the macroeconomic environment could also dampen enthusiasm. Ultimately, the trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on a delicate balance of these forces. While the current momentum is strong, a cautious and informed approach remains the best strategy for investors. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets Bitcoin‚Äôs spectacular rise above $118,000 is more than just a price milestone; it‚Äôs a powerful affirmation of its growing stature in the global financial system. This BTC surge is a culmination of increasing institutional interest, favorable macroeconomic conditions, inherent scarcity, and renewed retail enthusiasm. While the path ahead for the Crypto market will undoubtedly involve its share of volatility and challenges, the underlying trends suggest a continued expansion and integration of Digital assets into mainstream finance. For those seeking to understand and participate in this revolution, staying informed and exercising prudence, guided by sound Market analysis , will be paramount. The future of finance is rapidly evolving, and Bitcoin continues to lead the charge, promising an exciting, albeit unpredictable, journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused Bitcoin‚Äôs recent surge past $118,000? The recent surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased institutional adoption (like Bitcoin ETFs), macroeconomic conditions such as inflation concerns driving demand for inflation hedges, Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent scarcity due to its halving mechanism, and renewed interest from retail investors. 2. Is $118,000 an all-time high for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin has seen significant rallies, whether $118,000 is an all-time high depends on the specific market cycle and historical data at the time of this surge.

We worked hard. Thank you very much. Yeah, we worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS act. They named it after me. And I want to thank want to thank you. This is a hell of an act. You know, I did something very unusual. I said, this has been something it's been a lot of people thought it was impossible, some of the things that have been done. Then, of course, the great big beautiful idea, the word great, the great big beautiful bill, that was something that nobody thought possible. They thought it would be in anywhere from seven to maybe three. I'll go the opposite direction, but three to seven different bills. And we said, Let's just put it in one, because this way there's something for everyone. And there really is, is a lot of things for everyone. And when we get the word out how great that is for every single person in this country, virtually, and the all they have is a sound bite death. You know their sound bite is death. Aren't they nice that they are the most incompetent people. They've lost their confidence. They've lost everything, if you think about it, but Jasmine Crockett is on her way. She's on her way. That's She's the new star of the Democrat Party, Jasmine Crockett, they're in big trouble. But I have to tell you, that was great, and this was great, and I am so tired of making phone calls at 234, o'clock in the morning, getting calls from our great speaker, sir, we have 12 hard nos. I say, Mike, Mike, it's two o'clock in the morning. We have 12 hard Nos. The good news is I call up. Hello Jim. How are you, sir? You have my vote, Sir, you have my vote. I really just, they just want a little love. Unfortunately, it's always the same. It's always the same 12 people. That's, it's, it's five senators, and it's 12. And I actually said to John Thune, and I said to Mike, I said, Listen, I want to have a party, but not to those people that I have to speak to endlessly every time. And they're wonderful because they always seem to come through, other than a couple, Rand Paul Jr from Congress, and Rand Paul other than a few people. But I said, I want to have them over. We're going to have a party for everybody in Congress, everyone Congress, except 12. We're going to have and Mike is de I'll tell you what. Tom has definitely covered the whole group. Where are those 12 people? They're the only people I don't see. We could do it today. We don't have to vote. And I would say, of the 53 senators, 48 with a 48 in half, you won't even have to come to that one. But these are the greatest people, because they always vote yes, and we don't have to go crazy. You trust us. We trust you. That has been a very special group of people. We really do. I mean, 96% phenomenal. And 4% extremely difficult. Do you agree with that? But they get there, most of them, not all of them. Those are the ones we really don't like. But I want to thank you all for being here. This is really a big day. This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we signed the landmark genius Act into law. So congratulations to everybody. It is a big deal. It's come a long way since the Biden administration, when they had no idea what you were all talking about, and half of you are under arrest for no reason whatsoever, for no reason, and we want to have it not China. China wasn't actually have they were watching this thing. They like it. And we, we've got this, we've got AI, we've got a lot of, a lot of great ones happening. And this is a very big thing, and I want to thank the bill's author, Senator Bill Haggerty, a very good friend of mine. Thank you. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a very handsome guy. Looks great. He's got the whole package. But, you know, I got to know him. He was ambassador to Japan, and we had a little problem with Japan on trade, but he was my ambassador to Japan, and I went to Japan, and he is speaking fluently Japanese. I said, Did you learn it as a child? No, no, I just learned it over the last four or five months. I said, you learn Japanese? Maybe the single hardest language to learn, it's actually breathing, rather than it's breathing. I'm not going to imitate it, because we'll end up with a big story, and I don't want that. But he spoke totally fluent Japanese. I said, That's very impressive. And he was introducing me to Mr. Honda. I said, Oh, are you in the car business? He goes, yes. I said, You're a very rich man. And then he said, Mr. Toyota. Right, Toyota. Then I said, What business are you in? Let me guess. He said, cars. He was my interpreter, and I was so impressed. And I was getting ready to leave. He said, Sir, I'd like to run for the United States Senate. I said, Where are you from? He said, Tennessee. I said, Well, I love Tennessee, but do they know you there? No, but if you endorse me, I'll win, right? And I endorse him, and he took a 48 point lead, and they didn't know who the hell he was, and he's turned out to be a great senator, and now they all know who you are. So you are, you're fantastic, and we thank you, and you just the fact that you're doing this, and you understand this is a complicated world, and you understand it, Bill, so you've been great. Thank you very much. We're also pleased to be joined by our great Vice President, J de Vance. JD, thank you very much. Good job. And he's been up speaking late at night on the phone, I said. JD, how about you take it three or four of these people, please, because three or four I cannot speak to. I just can't and he take them, and he'd come through, right? JD, also speaker Mike Johnson, he is unbelievable. He's an unbelievable I mean, if you go by what we're doing, if you keep at this pace, you can't keep it up for another 200 days. But I will tell you this, if you keep up this pace for another week, you go down as the greatest speaker in the house in history. So one more word. Who needs Tip O'Neill? Who needs Tip O'Neill? He's better looking than Tip O'Neill too. But no, he's been going. He's been going at a fervent pace. Would you say that's right? Your wife probably says You are crazy. You've been aging beautifully in front. He's an amazing actually, he's an amazing speaker, a great leader, and everybody likes him and respects him, and that's why we're with a very small majority, like three. We had a time when we were one. Remember, we said we're one heart attack away from losing the house, and we won a couple of seats and a couple of other now we have seven, maybe, maybe, if we're lucky, seven, but we win with nobody's ever done I don't think anyone's ever done this before to win with those of all, we had a little help from John too, right? And a lot of other people I want to introduce, also Secretary Howard lucknick, who's been fantastic. You have done a great job, Howard, we've got great deals coming out of our ears. We have so many trade deals. And I really mean this too. It's like, how do you deal with so many but you know, I always say, well, we send out the papers that was a deal. They don't want to the fake news doesn't want to hear that. When I send out the paper that you're paying 35 or 40% tariff, that's a deal. Then they'll call and see if they can make a little bit different kind of a deal, like opening up their country to trade. In some cases, they've never been open. But we're doing well, and we have a couple of big ones to announce pretty soon, right? Could almost do it today. Maybe we'll say it. Maybe later on, we'll do it. Senator Bernie Moreno, what a great victory? Bernie had a great victory. Great Victory. That was one of the truly tough races. A lot of people weren't sure anybody could win that scene, and you won it in easy fashion, right? We want it together when you think of it, but you want it in easy fashion. Did a great job. Great guy, House Majority Whip. This is a great leader, Tom Emmer, a great politician and leader, really good. And I like his wife, even better, his wife is, she's the boss, but she's, she's, you are married to a fantastic woman. And he knows that, and he likes, he likes hearing it, because some people don't, you know. They say, Sir, could you please stop saying that my wife is better than me, sir, because the guys that don't usually end up with a good marriage, you know, he's got a great marriage. So thank you Tom. You really are a fantastic leader and representative and representatives Troy downing French Hill. Where's French Hill? Where is French you have been so great. Thank you, Coach. I spoke to him a little late when he was walking down the hall of st French he said, I'm there, sir. You a great, great, great guy. Everyone respects you French. You know that? Bill heisinger, Bill, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good job. Dan muser, I thought he was going to become the next Governor of Pennsylvania, but he likes Congress better, I guess so. But I think you're terrific. And you know, I would have always been behind you that I can tell you. Tim Moore, Tim, thank you. Tim. John, Rose, John, hi. John, thanks. Good job. Brian style, Brian style, still young, still nice and young, it's good. GT, Thompson. GT, thank you. Andy Barr, good friend of all of ours. Thank you, Andy. Monica de la Cruz, Monica, she's here someplace. Thank you, Monica. Thank you. Monica. Mike herodopoulos, Mike, thank you, Mike, look good. Mike Lawler, Mr. Salt, well, it should guarantee your district. I mean, you worked hard for New York, right? And you're on television. I'm on television. So this should be good for a couple of points, but without you and your couple of friends from New York, that wouldn't have happened. That was not easy, right? Congratulations. Great job. Anna, Paulina, Luna, Anna, who is so great, I don't even if she's here or not here, I want to tell you that she has been so great and worked so hard to make sure we got it approved. Ralph Norman, Ralph, Ralph, what happened to Ralph? Nick? Begich, Nick, thank you, Nick, good job. Good job. Good, good votes. I just saw a great poll on you. Huh? Very good congratulations. Like Andy ogles. Andy, terrific friend. Beth Van Dyne. Beth, thank you. Beth, great job. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great support. Roger Williams, a great baseball player who also had to take a bullet, unfortunately, but he is a great guy. He was involved in that whole catastrophe, but he's fantastic, and has been from day one, along with a lot of other people that I won't call out because I have no idea where the hell you are. I think I saw Jason here somewhere. Where's Jason? Oh, it's lucky I called him. Ooh, it's lucky. They didn't put your name because I invited you at the last moment, right? He was over there doing some business in the White House, but you've been incredible in your position. Nobody knows more about taxes and finance than you do, so we appreciate it, right? Is that true? Howard, it's true. Thanks, Jason, great job, and you'll help out with that other matter. You make him so strong and powerful, right? Along with Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Michael Fauci de Where is Michael Good? Michael, how are you good? You'll help out over there. Okay, and Ambassador Ken. Howie. Ambassador, thank you, Ken, great job, Ken. I also want to recognize some of the countless industry leaders here today, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, you've done a good job, Brian, that's a big deal. Dave Ripley of Kraken, Jeremy Allaire of circle, it was a big day. Good job. Good job. Jeremy. Paolo ardino of tether, hello Paulo. Thank you. Paolo. Ryan McInerney of visa, that's a good company. Thank you. Chris Pavlov, Rumble, Chris, Chris, what happened to your location? Chris, you're always a front row guy. You're just being nice today. I think How's rumble doing good? Good. If Rumble is doing good, that means truth is doing good. Truth, that's great. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Chris, very much. Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. Vlad, thank you, Brad, thank you. Vlad, good Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, these are two smart, handsome guys. They got the whole package. They're of Gemini, but they have the whole pack. They have a lot of things, actually, but Gemini is just the one for today, right? They've got the all, they've got the look. They've got the the genius. Got plenty of cash. And it's great that you're on our side. You guys are great. I could never tell them apart, but their mother, can I ask? Can your mother tell you apart? And the answer is yes, easily, or is it tough for her? Easy? I think. Thank you very much. It's great to be with you. Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation. And even before the signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock, or just about more a couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you, you have, certainly, as an industry, gone up more than anybody. Nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America. This is going to make us stronger. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good and strong and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country, and that's why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed soon. You know, Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign. All of a sudden. They loved you guys. They dropped all charges. They did have, I got you guys out of so much trouble, because you remember, you remember they were very they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved and and it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls. We won. Think of it. We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote. We won the districts by 2700 districts too, by the way, every, every once in a while, that number can change, but it doesn't change by March, the map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning, exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with Nashville Tennessee. Do you remember that day? Right? It was a big day, Nashville Tennessee, and I became the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin Conference, and at this time and at that time, crypto members and founders were under relentless by the Biden administration, which is trying to crush your industry and crush you as people and go after vicious people don't realize the what Joe was doing guy but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that you probably, if they're incompetent is better, right, because you don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today, but I pledge that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world, and that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further, you're going to do really well. And I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years. And very important. On day one, I remember I did this, and I said this, and I mentioned this name, and I got the greatest applause of the whole campaign. We fired Joe Biden's, sec chair, Gary Gensler, you a speech. It was just a line in speech. And I said, and I will fire Gary guessing, the place exploded. I finished that one, and I said, What the hell did that guy do? Hatred there turned out as I got for rigged with everything, it turned out you were absolutely right. In his place, I appointed a visionary chairman who wants America to build the future and not block the future. He's going to be unbelievable. He'll go down as one of the greats and fall at me. The crypto guys, they said, everybody said, not only crypto every they all wanted Paul for the position, and he's a tough cookie too. He's just but they actually said, We don't care. We just think he's fair. All they learned was fairness. And they have somebody that you're really a champion of the street and you're a champion of the country, you do a fantastic job. I saw you interviewed the other night. I watched it two o'clock in the morning, this little thing called Sea Spanish. I don't know how many people were watching. Don't worry, you were in prime time too with that. But fantastic job. Absolutely so perfect for the job. Congratulations, Paul and Paul is here today among the commissioners, various commissioners, including pastor Pierce and Laura. Thank you very much, and thank you, Mark, wherever you may be here because of the thunderous applause, tremendous things about both of you. Thank you very much. My first week in office, I also established the first ever presidential Working Group on digital assets, and we have an executive director wiz behind a football player, right? Bo is a great football player, one of the better players in college football. So who would think that I know that Daniel a lot of things from he was a genuine player. I stopped the weaponization of government against crypto or Bitcoin, and we ended the lawless operation. Choke point 2.0 that was a bad operation, and I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Ulbrich. No idea how. I had no idea how important that day became. Was like a symbol, and his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman, but it was so, so important to a certain group of people. And in the truly momentous Act last March, I signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as the United States Digital Asset stockpile, and that's all signed up, and With today's signing we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier, just as I promised last year, the genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework To establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar backed stable coins. This could have been perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet. So a lot of people are saying that. I don't know. What do you guys think? Yes, we'll tell you many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of days, many, many years out of days. You know that Paul and others are straightening it out the payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade using the state of the art crypto technology. Who would have thought we would have been saying that two years after I met you for the first time, the genius Act provides banks, businesses and financial institutions, a framework for issuing crypto assets back one for one, with real us, dollars, treasury bills and other cash equivalents, is really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar great prominence. And you know, you have this little group called bricks. It's fading out fast, but bricks is they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar, and the standard of the dollar. And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10% and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up. Physically, no, no, we didn't want to. They didn't want to be tariffed today. It's amazing. Now we're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy that could happen, like the last one, he would have. You ever asked him about the dollar slide? He would have no idea. But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors and people all over the world will then be able to use those stable coins for ultra low cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds, rather than weeks and months. And it's really an amazing thing with privacy, flexibility and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to study and transfer in US dollars. It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really a great thing. There'll be a lot of Democrat support. I have to tell you that I was shocked anytime we get one dem, but we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciated, which just shows you that you're doing the right thing. This will increase demand for US Treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important, you know, we lost that. That would be like losing a world war. We can never let anyone play games with us, and that's why, when I heard about this group from breaks six countries, basically, I hit them very, very hard, and they have a form. It will end very quickly. I will tell you to them. They won't. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even they're virtually afraid to me, I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America will happen. You some of the Congress, men and women, and they wanted that so badly. You know, I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was to be honest. Please, sir, please the central bank, digital currency, will you have to make sure. And they say, What do you know about that? It's amazing the knowledge that people have made all of a sudden, we don't have problems with some of them. I said, we've already got it from the Fed, right from Congress and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth house Sure. We have to get it. And it's but they knew their subject. I didn't, and we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a cbdc and the United States, and very soon, I look forward to signing legislation that will notify and ban the make it a permanent. Law put it in permanence. I'm also committed to selling animal crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more, more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry, and for a little while, two nights ago, we were really concerned, as we live short of bucks. I would say maybe we were about nine short, nine short at three in the morning. We were about four short at 330 in the morning, and we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning. But the people, a few people, are fought harder for the bill that we're signing than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable. It's our White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks and he has a show now become a show a couple of years ago. That's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, you kept it going a lot longer, and you got, is that still your eyes rated every show? Well, he knows what to say. Maybe 50 millions of people. They said, what's going on? But we had a great show. They said, You know, I had a really small decision. I get elected. I was running at that time, if I get elected, bring him into government and some of his work, unfortunately, we made a lot of money. They're very rich. He's a very rich media, but this is more important. Des, me too. It's like doesn't matter. This is much. I know how I talk about it all the time. How would you go back to those wonderful brokerage firm hire one or two people, and it's not the same. It's not the same as what you're doing, right? The biggest with one of the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is the biggest where you ended up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be 1000 IBM, if you think of it. It's the biggest deal ever done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and $79,000 commission but I want to ask David, so David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job. And I'd like to ask David come up say if you would. David Sacks Thank you, President Trump. It's a great Trump. It's a great, great honor to be here. And it's true that I never expected to work in government at all. And then everything changed after President Trump came on my podcast. And I, you know, I accepted this job as crypto as well because I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a President who really wants to get things done for the American people. And if anything, that's been an understatement. The first six months this administration have been more successful than any administration in American history. President Trump has worked at that tech speed we're used to working fast at Silicon Valley, but even this has passed for us in Silicon Valley, the speed of the team with President Trump's really incredible. And now today, you have another historic legislative achievement to make the United States a crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road. It will update arcade payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend US dollar anonymous, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a US bank account, which will create trillions of dollars demand for US Treasuries. So that is the power of this bill, as you asked all the comments, this is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump. And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank, first, my family for being here. Thank you, fellow wise who President Trump mentioned, the director of our crypto Council. He released in a heavy lifting here, Tracy Johnson as well Harry and French Hill and all the congressman, senators, and we've already been met by President Trump, so I'll save the time, but it's really been hard for this is really a team effort, but most of all, to thank President Trump for accomplishing what nobody thought was possible. And it's true that just earlier this week, the media was reporting that this bill was dead. This bill was dead, and then the media didn't know one thing, that we have a secret weapon. We have a dealmakder in chief. And thanks to President Trump, he stepped in and save this bill, and it's because of your vision, your leadership, your determination, your skill that we're all here today. Donald Trump This is our superstar. She was the head of the Republican Party, and don't become beautiful two children, but she has been so good. She stepped into that position like there was nothing. That we want. And she said, Dad, I'd like to go home right now to my beautiful husband and my son and daughter, Rhett. They give you a fantastic job, and you work with a great gentleman too. He's doing a fantastic job. But I just want to thank you. I just need to stand here right now. I wanted to bring on. And thank you very much. Thank you. So under the Trump administration, as I just got back from Saudi Arabia, and we went to Qatar, we went to a number of countries, and I will tell you the the level of respect that this country has now is incredible. The UAE, I tell you what, we had a time there, but every leader said the same thing. They said, one year ago, your country was dead, and it said that way it was like supposed to be happy or insulted. But the truth is we were in deep trouble. But they said one year ago, your country was dead, and today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. And it's true, we have the hottest country in the world. We had a country where a laughing stock with the borders, people pouring in. Can you imagine last month, in the month of June, actually zero. Now I don't even believe that zero, if you have hundreds of 1000s pouring in, or get over seven zero, but they have it down to zero. And very liberal people take that particular Oh, so liberal. So they're not giving us any fairness in zero people coming through a border. Can you imagine that for literally hundreds of people? All over the world. They came from prisons, jails. They came from mental institutions, gang members. They were gangs. They came from all over the place, from every country they came from the Congo and Africa. A lot from the Congo. They came from South America. A lot of came from Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country. Can you imagine? They allowed that empty de jails into our country, and they let them walk right into our country like perfect, 11,888 committed murder. 50% committed more than one person. They murdered more than one person, 50% of 11,088 and we had murderers, and we're getting them out, and Tom Holman and Kristi are doing a great job at Town Hallman. Okay, you see central casting or what, and it takes abuse, but they just, they just keep fighting, and they're winning, and we're winning in the courts, and we're winning everywhere. But we've got the hottest country in the world, and you're a big part of it. So the golden age of America is upon us, and with today, signing the beauty of crypto and crypto industry and US dollar working together because they really are hand in hand, because they'll be stronger and bigger and better than ever before. And I just want to thank everybody, some tremendous people in this room, and maybe you want to sign I'll ask some of our great senators and congressmen to come on up, some of the top crypto guys, please come on up, because you guys work very hard on this, and we'll sign this, and we'll get on to the next panel, and we'll win. But we're we're winning all over the world right now. It's not even close, not even to us, and We're going to keep it going. Thank you, everybody. You world, which is a big scandal that we're a Republican, it would really be a big it is One of the great standards. Thank you Very much.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/18/trump-signs-genius-act-into-law-the-full-transcript,"REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS","Policy|Donald Trump|stablecoin bill|News",cryptocompare
