2025-07-18T21:40:43,"Why Ethereum Is Rising Faster as BTC Stalls – And the Biggest Bet on a Bitcoin Layer-2 Draws Over 300K in 2 Days","Ethereum (ETH) has gained another 8% overnight, while Bitcoin (BTC), although it breached past $120,000, ticked 1.6% over the same period. Part of ETH’s rise stems from the passing of the GENIUS Act – legislation that offers long-awaited clarity for stablecoins, which are heavily built on Ethereum. The rally is also backed by fresh institutional accumulation, with ETH gaining strength as the utility layer of Web3. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, after recently setting a new local high, appears to have paused in its ascent. But the real surprise is what’s happening beneath the surface. Its fastest Layer-2 solution to date Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has raised over $300,000 in the past 48 hours alone, pushing its total funding to over $3.31 million. It seems early investors are positioning themselves not just on Bitcoin the asset but on Bitcoin’s future. One that looks more dynamic, usable, and programmable. HYPER tokens are currently priced at $0.0123, with less than 14 hours remaining before the next presale stage triggers a price increase. Ethereum Extends Its Climb While Bitcoin Stalls – But Heavy Bets Are Now Flowing Into BTC’s Fastest Layer-2 Ethereum (ETH) has climbed steadily this week, touching a local high of $3,626 on Friday before easing slightly to around $3,585.50 as of writing. The rally comes on the back of renewed institutional interest and growing political tailwinds. Source: TradingView The GENIUS Act – a landmark bill that cleared the Senate in June – was officially passed by the House on Thursday, paving the way for federal-level stablecoin regulation. Designed to bring regulatory clarity to stablecoins and tokenized assets, the legislation is seen as a major win for Ethereum’s core infrastructure. With the vast majority of stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and tokenized platforms built on Ethereum, the market interpreted the latest developments as a bullish signal for further institutional adoption.

French $Hill emphasizes the need to pass the $GENIUS Act: ""We can’t afford to overlook this opportunity to advance stablecoin regulations and enhance consumer safeguards Supported across several Congressional sessions, this legislation is crucial for… pic.twitter.com/1jx4TYBvc4 — COACHTY (@TheRealTRTalks) July 17, 2025 Ethereum spot ETFs also saw fresh inflows this week – over $726 million – reinforcing the narrative that institutions are doubling down on ETH exposure ahead of regulatory certainty. Bitcoin (BTC), by contrast, has lost steam. After reaching a high of $122,838, it even slipped to $116,000 earlier in the week before settling to its current price. Without a strong narrative or upgrade cycle to drive it forward, Bitcoin’s price appears to be consolidating, as traders look elsewhere for growth. But while BTC trades flat, trust in its long-term potential hasn’t gone away – it’s just shifting to a different kind of bet. One of the most talked-about moves this week is the rapid rise of Bitcoin Hyper , a high-speed Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The presale’s been moving so fast, it’s almost hard to believe it only launched a little over a month ago. It’s clear that while Bitcoin may be stalling on the charts, those who still believe in its future are backing Bitcoin’s transition from a settlement layer to a programmable network. This Is What Bitcoin Scaling Was Meant to Look Like As mentioned, Bitcoin Hyper is built on the SVM, and it works like this: BTC is locked on-chain using a non-custodial, zero-knowledge bridge, and a wrapped version is minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. From there, it becomes usable across a high-speed network that combines the execution speed of Solana with the value base of Bitcoin without compromising either. Instead of sitting idle in cold wallets or static ETF holdings, BTC can now move freely across applications that were previously out of reach. Trading with near-zero fees, deploying DeFi protocols with native BTC liquidity, or launching NFT drops that are settled on Bitcoin. And while all of that runs on Layer-2, the Bitcoin itself stays locked on the base chain secured by Bitcoin’s own consensus. The bridge uses zero-knowledge proofs for verification, so users can move BTC in and out without middlemen, while keeping full trust in the original network. And for users who simply want to retrieve their BTC, the process is just as seamless: burn the wrapped version on Layer-2, and the original Bitcoin is released from the bridge. Source: https://bitcoinhyper.com/ Bitcoin Hyper is primed for rapid development, with SDKs and APIs already live and full support for Rust – the go-to language across Solana and Web3. Builders can start immediately, without learning obscure frameworks or custom languages. And unlike past attempts like Stacks or Rootstock, there’s no added friction or fragmentation – Bitcoin Hyper preserves the BTC base while unlocking real programmability. This Is Where the Next Bitcoin Breakout Is Being Built While Ethereum rallies on utility and clarity, Bitcoin drifts currently without direction – and that’s why capital is shifting toward what Bitcoin could become. Bitcoin Hyper is getting funding not for what BTC is today, but what it can be tomorrow. If you’re seeing the same trend unfold – where Bitcoin benefits from speed, programmability, and more real use cases – now’s the time to move. Again, over $3.31 million has already been raised in the Bitcoin Hyper presale, with 191 million HYPER tokens staked on its native protocol offering a dynamic 274% APY . This shows early believers are truly in it for the long haul. Head to the Bitcoin Hyper website to secure your HYPER tokens before the next price increase. You can buy with SOL, ETH, USDT, BNB, or even a credit card. For a smoother experience, consider using Best Wallet – HYPER, which is already listed under Upcoming Tokens, making it easy to track, manage, and claim. Join the conversation on Telegram and X .

2025-07-18T21:10:09,"Russia considers allowing cryptocurrency payments on two islands","Russia should allow companies registered on two islands at both ends of the vast country to conduct settlements in cryptocurrencies, a Russian senator has suggested. The destinations are designated as special administrative regions, and the digital transactions there won’t clash with the central bank’s stance that crypto payments must be kept outside the nation’s main jurisdiction. Russia to trial crypto payments in the heart of Europe and the Far East Russian firms based in the special administrative regions (SARs) established on Russky Island, in the Far-Eastern Primorsky Krai, and Oktyabrsky Island, in the Pregolya River in Russia’s European exclave of Kaliningrad, may start testing cryptocurrency settlements. The idea was pitched by Alexander Shenderyuk-Zhidkov, deputy chairman of the Committee on Budget and Financial Markets at the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, informally called the Senate. Quoted by the business daily Vedomosti, the lawmaker explained that such entities are not considered residents of the Russian Federation as far as currency regulations are concerned. This would allow them to carry out crypto transactions outside the space reserved for the Russian ruble, the only legal tender in the country, as required by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). While cryptocurrencies are yet to be comprehensively regulated, they have been recognized as property for various purposes, but using them for payments in the Russian Federation is prohibited. So far, Russia’s monetary authority has only agreed to permit their use in cross-border settlements for foreign trade, exclusively within an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) under its strict supervision. The mechanism is allegedly used by Russian businesses to bypass financial restrictions imposed by Western sanctions, but the CBR has not disclosed either the full terms or the organizations involved. According to Zhidkov, the implementation of the ELR is “too slow.” He was quoted as stating: “I would not like it if we spent six years getting the law right … After all, the ELR is experimental, so that we can experiment, and then accept this and spread it.” The senator is convinced it’s possible to extend the ELR rules to the SARs on the two islands and give some leeway in their interpretation. Shenderyuk-Zhidkov believes this can also help attract what he called “foreign companies with Russian roots,” thus bringing some of the crypto assets with Russian origins back to the country as a measure countering capital flight. As of the end of 2024, there were nearly 500 companies registered in Russia’s special administrative regions that offer flexible tax and currency regulations, among which the Russian tech giant Yandex, for example. Experts say it’s a sound idea that still needs Bank of Russia’s nod Allowing companies registered on the two islands to use cryptocurrencies for settlements is fairly realistic, according to Mikhail Uspensky, member of the expert council of the working group on legislative regulation of cryptocurrency circulation at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. This would increase the number of players authorized to make crypto payments, which will have a positive effect on the development of the whole market in Russia, predicted Uspensky. However, he expects the initiative to face a long series of approval procedures before getting the green light. Maria Agranovskaya, Managing Partner of the Agranovskaya & Partners law firm, largely agreed in her comments: “The idea itself is sound, but we need to think deeply about how to do it correctly without breaking the law … The opinion of the Bank of Russia is important.” Zhidkov’s proposal is not the first of its kind. Back in 2018, the Ministry of Finance suggested using the SARs to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. “We are considering organized trading on Russky Island and Oktyabrsky Island, but we believe this should be allowed in [the rest of] Russia,” its deputy head, Alexey Moiseev, said at the time. Since then, the department seems to have rather sided with the CBR’s position on crypto operations in the country.

2025-07-18T21:05:36,"The Node: The Mad Journey from Terra to GENIUS","Remember Terra? Do Kwon’s layer 1 was designed in such a way that its native token, LUNA, worked in tandem with the network’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST. When you minted new UST, you destroyed LUNA tokens (thereby constricting supply), and when you redeemed UST, you created new LUNA (expanding supply). That system worked wonderfully as long as UST experienced great demand — which it did, for a while, thanks to a 20% yearly interest on the coin supplied by Anchor Protocol. But in May 2022, huge selloffs caused UST to lose its $1 peg; market participants rushed to redeem their UST, creating a massive new amount of LUNA and pushing the token’s price down, which of course led to more UST redemptions, and so on. Over $40 billion in market value was obliterated in 72 hours. Terra’s collapse shook the crypto industry, which back then was levered to the gills. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital blew up , while crypto lenders such as Voyager , BlockFi and Celsius went bust. If that wasn’t enough, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Ethereum’s Tornado Cash, sending developers all over the world in a bit of a panic. After CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported in November 2022 that Alameda was quite possibly broke, people started yanking their funds out of FTX, which led Bankman-Fried to freeze withdrawals. It turned out that SBF had been fraudulently using FTX customer funds to palliate losses incurred by Alameda Research over the course of the years. Bankman-Fried was arrested (and subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison) shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Shortly after FTX’s demise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler began an aggressive campaign against the sector, suing a huge number of crypto firms (including Coinbase and Kraken ) and ushering in an era of “regulation by enforcement” that was decried by the industry and friendly members of Congress alike. That wasn’t the end of crypto’s tribulations. Crypto lender Genesis and bitcoin miner Core Scientific were soon added to the list of casualties. Worse, in March 2023 three crypto-friendly banks (Signature, Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank) suffered from bank-runs and collapsed , making it significantly more difficult for crypto firms to access the banking system. Nic Carter, a prominent crypto VC, accused the Biden administration of trying to debank the crypto industry by employing an Obama-era strategy, a theory which has since gained traction within Congress and the Trump administration. But the winds of fortune finally turned in crypto’s favor. When BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June 2023, it felt like Larry Fink himself was shooting a flare in the dark, signaling that Wall Street was ready to embrace crypto. Two months later, Grayscale defeated the SEC in court on the matter of converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The agency had little choice than to greenlight a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, which later became the most successful new ETFs of all time. At first showing signs of reluctance about launching spot ether ETFs, the SEC suddenly scrambled to approve the products at the last minute. Some observers linked the change of heart to Trump’s new friendliness towards the crypto industry, which contrasted with Joe Biden’s hostility . The fact that the crypto industry donated a tremendous amount of money to the former’s campaign (and to other pro-crypto politicians) certainly helped as well; we saw yesterday that the Democratic Party, once in lockstep with Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto crusade , strongly voted in favor of both the GENIUS and Clarity bills. Trump’s overwhelming victory in November sent shockwaves through Washington and the crypto industry. The new administration kept its word, though not without hiccups in the form of Trump- and Melania-themed memecoins . Ross Ulbricht is now a free man , and an executive order has been signed to constitute a bitcoin reserve (multiple states, like Texas, Arizona and New Hampshire, have followed suit ). Treasury’s OFAC has taken Tornado Cash off of the sanctions list , while the SEC has dropped most of its lawsuits and is gearing up to greenlight a bunch of new crypto ETFs. Debanking is no longer a concern . Congress, meanwhile, just passed the GENIUS Act (which creates a framework for regulating stablecoins (unthinkable in the wake of Terra’s collapse!!) and will probably pass the Clarity Act (a more complex piece of legislation that assigns clear jurisdiction to the SEC and CFTC when it comes to crypto) before the end of the year. Not to mention that Coinbase stock is trading at record highs, Tether is now seen as one of the most successful businesses in the world, Circle has gone public, Core Scientific (back from the dead) is on track to get acquired by AI firm CoreWeave, and Michael Saylor’s bitcoin evangelization has given birth to a horde of companies looking to follow in his footsteps to purchase as much BTC (or ETH or SOL or even DOGE ) as they possibly can. All of these events have been reflected in bitcoin’s price. The orange coin, which you could briefly buy for $16,000 after FTX collapsed, is now priced at roughly $120,000, and the total market capitalization of the crypto sector is near $4 trillion (up from $830 million in December 2022).",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/18/the-node-the-mad-journey-from-terra-to-genius,"LUNA|BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Opinion|The Node|Stablecoins|Trump|Congress|Opinion",cryptocompare

2025-07-18T20:59:56,"Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, creating official rules for stablecoins","President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday inside the White House, following through on a key campaign promise to support crypto. Surrounded by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives, Trump finalized the bill that brings in new rules for stablecoins, officially locking in Congress’s first real attempt to regulate crypto. According to the fact sheets, the law gives stablecoins a defined legal structure. It also cements crypto’s growing influence in Washington, putting the industry in front of the cameras and into official U.S. policy. Trump didn’t hold back when speaking to the crowd. “This could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself,” he said . “A lot of people are saying that. What do you guys think? If you say yes, I’m saying yes.” Trump praises allies, highlights crypto campaign gains Trump was joined at the signing by several Republican leaders who helped get the bill passed. He named Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who wrote the legislation; House Financial Services Chair French Hill of Arkansas; House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota; and Speaker Mike Johnson. Industry names were also recognized: Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Jeremy Allaire of Circle, and Paolo Ardoino of Tether. “This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up,” Trump said to the crypto execs in the room. Trump used the 2024 election to push pro-crypto policies in contrast to the Biden administration’s tougher stance. “It’s good for the dollar and it’s good for the country,” he said. “And that’s why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote, I will say.” But Trump’s connection to crypto isn’t just about policy. Bloomberg found that he’s made around $620 million from crypto projects during his second term. That includes $460 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm that sells its own tokens. The Trump family has a financial stake in that venture. On top of that, Reuters reported that Trump’s meme coin, called $TRUMP, has pulled in about $320 million in fees, although it’s unclear how much of that cash has gone directly to entities Trump controls. Democrats blast the bill as a conflict of interest The bill wasn’t met with universal applause. Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have raised alarms over Trump’s deepening ties to the crypto space. “The GENIUS Act will accelerate Trump’s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market and the reach and profitability of Trump’s USD1,” Warren said on the Senate floor back in May. “And, for the first time in American history, this bill will make our President, Donald Trump, the regulator of his own financial product.” Republicans didn’t stop with the GENIUS Act. The GOP-controlled House also passed two more crypto-focused bills this week. The first, which cleared in a 219-210 vote without Democratic support, would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. The second one, called the Clarity Act, passed by 294-134 and would reduce the SEC’s authority over crypto, giving the industry more room to operate. Seventy-eight House Democrats joined Republicans in voting for it. Trump closed out the signing by promising more expansion. “We’re going to be growing it even more,” he said about the crypto industry, “more than anyone ever thought.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-signs-crypto-bill-genius-act-into-law/,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Regulation|BTC",cryptocompare
