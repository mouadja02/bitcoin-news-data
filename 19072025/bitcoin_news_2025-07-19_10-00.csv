Over the past year, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by an impressive 277% , climbing to a new all-time high of $3.66 before easing slightly to around $3.45. But according to popular crypto trader EGRAG CRYPTO , the real story isn’t just the price, it’s XRP’s growing dominance, which he says is pointing to a “mega bullish wave.” Bullish Pennant and the Kaboom Setup According to EGRAG, XRP’s dominance chart has just broken out of a bullish pennant, a classic technical pattern that often precedes large upward moves. He predicts this breakout could trigger gains of 21% to 275%, which would be one of the biggest rallies XRP has ever seen. What’s adding to the excitement is that the key factor driving this prediction is the Visible Range Volume Profile (VRVP) indicator. EGRAG notes that there’s a “void” zone above 5.75% dominance. If XRP crosses and holds above this level, it could spark what he calls the Kaboom phase, a period of explosive growth in XRP’s dominance. Fibonacci Levels Backing the Surge EGRAG also shared his XRP Fab chart, which maps XRP’s potential market cap against global crypto capitalization using Fibonacci levels. For instance, at a $10 trillion crypto market cap, XRP’s market cap could soar beyond $2 trillion if it hits the 0.888 Fibonacci level. Even a conservative target could place XRP’s market cap between $800 billion and $1.5 trillion, levels never seen before for the token. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP price is trading near $3.44 after hitting a new high of $3.66, showing strong demand from both traders and big investors. Meanwhile, a Golden Cross (50‑day EMA moving above the 100‑day EMA) confirms bullish momentum, while the MACD buy signal that started on June 28 is still active, keeping risk appetite alive. If XRP stays above $3.50 and breaks $3.66, it could enter a price discovery phase. Therefore, Crypto EGRAG believes that with rising dominance and whale accumulation, a move toward $5 or more is possible.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-dominance-signals-a-mega-bullish-wave-analyst-eyes-5-target/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-19T07:38:28,"El Salvador Hasn’t Bought Bitcoin Since December 2024, Says IMF Report","The post El Salvador Hasn’t Bought Bitcoin Since December 2024, Says IMF Report appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News El Salvador made global headlines in 2021 when it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership. The move earned praise from Bitcoin maximalists worldwide and positioned the nation as a testbed for large-scale crypto adoption. But as of mid-2025, that bold vision appears to be fading—and fast. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy On November 16, 2022, Bukele announced El Salvador would begin buying 1 Bitcoin per day. Around the same time, the country set up a National Bitcoin Office to coordinate crypto initiatives. These developments, along with BTC’s legal status, signaled the government’s deep commitment to Bitcoin adoption. Bukele’s policies—pro-crypto and anti-establishment—resonated with many Salvadorans, helping him secure a historic re-election in February 2024. IMF Bailout Exposes BTC Slowdown Despite its revolutionary image, El Salvador’s economy struggled under mounting debt and inflation. To stabilize finances, the government turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which approved a $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility in February 2025 . However, the IMF made one thing clear: El Salvador must limit public-sector Bitcoin activity, including BTC purchases and transactions. The government publicly pushed back, stating it would continue buying Bitcoin—claims echoed across official social media. But a July 15, 2025 IMF report told a different story. El Salvador Hasn’t Bought Bitcoin Since December 2024 According to the IMF, El Salvador hasn’t purchased any new Bitcoin since December 2024—the same month IMF talks concluded. The report clarified that recent wallet activity was merely internal transfers, not fresh acquisitions. Even more telling, Bitcoin quietly lost its legal tender status in January 2025, signaling a strategic backpedal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Could Hit New Highs by July-End, Says Galaxy Digital , What’s Next? Privatization and Policy Reversal Chivo Wallet, the state-sponsored Bitcoin wallet, will reportedly be privatized by the end of July 2025. Rumors also suggest El Salvador may dissolve Fidebitcoin, the government-run Bitcoin trust. These moves signal a clear shift: compliance with IMF terms now takes priority over Bitcoin experimentation. While El Salvador’s leadership once stood firm on Bitcoin adoption , recent developments indicate a pivot toward economic pragmatism. The IMF bailout has reshaped national priorities—and Bitcoin is no longer center stage. Whether this marks the end or a pause in El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-19T07:25:18,"Crypto Liquidation: Shocking $270M+ Wiped Out in 24 Hours","BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidation: Shocking $270M+ Wiped Out in 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often characterized by rapid price swings and intense trading activity. For many traders, the allure of amplified gains draws them to derivatives like perpetual futures. However, this high-stakes environment also comes with significant risks, none more dramatic than crypto liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed a staggering amount of capital wiped out, highlighting the inherent volatility and the critical importance of risk management in perpetual futures trading. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these massive liquidations mean for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Are Perpetual Futures in Crypto Trading? Before we dissect the recent numbers, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiration date, perpetual futures in crypto never expire. They are designed to mimic the spot market price of an asset while allowing traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This innovative instrument has become incredibly popular due to its flexibility and the potential for magnified profits. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Funding Rates: A mechanism unique to perpetual futures that ensures the contract price stays tethered to the spot price. Traders pay or receive small fees based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Understanding Crypto Liquidation: The Sudden Wipeout So, what happens when a trader’s leveraged position goes awry? That’s where crypto liquidation comes into play. In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This typically happens when the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. To prevent further losses for the exchange and the trader, the position is automatically closed by the exchange. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, some exchanges might issue a “margin call,” prompting traders to add more funds to their account. Automatic Closure: If the trader fails to add more margin or the price continues to move unfavorably, the position is automatically closed at the market price. Loss of Collateral: The trader loses their initial margin and any additional collateral they might have put up. This can lead to significant, often total, loss of the invested capital for that specific trade. The Past 24 Hours: A Staggering Crypto Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto liquidation events across major assets. Here’s a breakdown of the reported figures: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (24h) Long Liquidations (%) Ethereum (ETH) $151.00 million 75.91% Bitcoin (BTC) $76.46 million 87.91% Ripple (XRP) $42.18 million 81.22% The total liquidations across these three assets alone exceeded $270 million , with a dominant majority being “long” positions. This indicates that a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard, forcing their bullish bets to be closed out. ETH: The Largest Hit in Crypto Liquidation Ethereum led the pack with an astonishing $151 million in liquidations. With nearly 76% of these being long positions, it suggests that many traders were highly leveraged, betting on ETH’s price to continue its upward trajectory. A sudden dip in ETH’s price likely triggered a cascade of liquidations, as positions were automatically closed, adding selling pressure to the market. BTC: Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride and its Impact on Crypto Liquidation Bitcoin, the market leader, saw $76.46 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of long positions at almost 88%. This underscores Bitcoin’s continued influence on the broader market; often, when BTC dips, altcoins follow. Traders anticipating a continued bull run for BTC found themselves in a precarious situation as prices corrected. XRP: A Ripple Effect of Crypto Liquidation XRP experienced $42.18 million in liquidations, with over 81% being long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a significant amount for XRP traders. It highlights that even assets with specific legal or fundamental news can be susceptible to broader market movements and the perils of high leverage. Why Such Massive Crypto Liquidations? Unpacking the Triggers Several interconnected factors contribute to large-scale crypto liquidation events: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sharp, unpredictable price movements, often triggered by macro-economic news, regulatory announcements, or large whale movements, can quickly push leveraged positions into liquidation territory. Excessive Leverage: While leverage offers amplified gains, it equally amplifies losses. Many traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x), meaning even a small percentage move against their position can lead to total loss of their margin. Cascading Effects: When initial liquidations occur, the forced selling of those positions adds further downward pressure on prices, which in turn triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect. This “liquidation cascade” can exacerbate market downturns rapidly. Lack of Risk Management: Many traders, especially new ones, often overlook robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders or managing position sizing. The Ripple Effect: What Do Large Liquidations Mean for the Market? Massive crypto liquidation events are more than just individual losses; they have broader implications for the market: Increased Volatility: The forced selling from liquidations adds to market sell pressure, potentially accelerating price declines. Shift in Sentiment: Large liquidation events can dampen overall market sentiment, leading to fear and uncertainty among traders. Opportunity for Savvy Traders: While devastating for those liquidated, these events can present buying opportunities for well-capitalized traders looking to enter positions at lower prices. Market Reset: In some cases, a significant liquidation flush can “reset” the market, clearing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for healthier, more sustainable growth. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Traders Understanding crypto liquidation is one thing; avoiding it is another. Here are actionable insights for traders: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: The most crucial step. Use lower leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or during highly volatile periods. Consider 2x-5x leverage instead of 50x-100x. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This automatically closes your position if the price hits a predefined level, preventing a full liquidation. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of both initial and maintenance margin requirements for your chosen exchange and asset. Don’t Over-Leverage Based on FOMO: Chasing pumps with high leverage is a common pitfall that often leads to liquidation. Stick to your trading plan. Keep an Eye on Funding Rates: High funding rates can indicate an overheated market, where many traders are long, making it more susceptible to a long squeeze and subsequent liquidations. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged futures positions. Balance with spot holdings and other less volatile assets. The Dark Side of Leverage: Challenges and Risks While the promise of amplified gains is enticing, the reality of high leverage in crypto futures trading often involves significant challenges and risks. The primary risk is the rapid and complete loss of capital. Unlike spot trading where your asset value might decrease but you still hold the asset, in leveraged futures, your entire collateral can be wiped out in moments. The psychological toll of watching a position get liquidated can also be immense, leading to emotional and irrational trading decisions. Furthermore, the complexity of perpetual futures, including funding rates and margin calls, can be overwhelming for inexperienced traders, increasing their vulnerability to sudden market shifts and crypto liquidation . Opportunities Amidst Volatility: Who Benefits from Crypto Liquidation? While mass liquidations are detrimental to those caught on the wrong side, they are not without beneficiaries. Market makers and exchanges often profit from the increased trading volume and fees generated during periods of high volatility and liquidation. Savvy short sellers who correctly anticipate a market downturn can also realize substantial gains as long positions are forcibly closed. Furthermore, long-term investors or “whales” with deep pockets may view these dips, exacerbated by liquidations, as prime opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Ultimately, market resets due to excessive leverage being flushed out can create a healthier foundation for future growth. The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto liquidation in perpetual futures serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading. While the potential for substantial gains exists, the market’s unforgiving nature can swiftly turn profits into significant losses. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation, managing leverage prudently, and employing robust risk management strategies are not merely suggestions but necessities for survival in the volatile world of crypto derivatives. Approach perpetual futures with caution, knowledge, and a disciplined mindset, and you stand a much better chance of navigating the storms and capitalizing on the opportunities that arise.

What is crypto liquidation in simple terms? Crypto liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a certain threshold due to unfavorable price movements. It’s designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account and to protect the exchange. 2. Why do most liquidations tend to be “long” positions? Most liquidations are often “long” positions because many retail traders are inherently bullish on crypto and tend to bet on price increases. When the market experiences a sudden downturn, these leveraged long positions are the first to be hit and liquidated. 3. How can I avoid crypto liquidation? To avoid liquidation, manage your leverage carefully (use lower leverage), always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, monitor your margin balance, and avoid over-leveraging based on emotional decisions like FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Consider diversifying your portfolio as well. 4. Do crypto exchanges benefit from liquidations? While exchanges don’t directly “profit” from a trader’s loss, they do benefit from the increased trading volume and transaction fees generated during periods of high volatility and liquidation. They also ensure market stability by closing risky positions. 5. Is perpetual futures trading safe? Perpetual futures trading is inherently high-risk due to the use of leverage. While it offers the potential for amplified gains, it also carries the risk of rapid and complete loss of capital. It is not recommended for beginners or those without a strong understanding of risk management and market dynamics. 6. What is a “liquidation cascade”? A liquidation cascade occurs when initial liquidations trigger further price movements (usually downwards), which in turn trigger more liquidations. This creates a chain reaction of forced selling, exacerbating market downturns and leading to massive amounts of capital being wiped out in a short period.

2025-07-19T07:22:08,"Five Developers Propose a Very Marginal Proposal for Bitcoin: It’s Related to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Assets and Could Disrupt BTC","Bitcoin's cryptographic security is under serious threat with the rise of quantum computers. Casa CTO Jameson Lopp and five developers have proposed a new defensive shield for the BTC network to counter this threat. The new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), presented in San Francisco, aims to create a post-quantum address security system. Its most notable proposal: freezing the approximately 1 million Bitcoins believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which have been dormant for years. Experts say that with the development of quantum computers, methods like Shor's algorithm could reverse-engineer private keys once sufficient processing power is available. According to Deloitte research, approximately a quarter of Bitcoins are vulnerable to quantum attacks. If this happens within the next 10 years, a massive market crash could occur, including the loss of millions of BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Related News: White House Cryptocurrency Executive Bo Hines Announced: “Trump Will Sign The Decision That Will Change The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies Today” The BIP proposal presented by Lopp and his team includes a three-phase security plan: Blocking new funds from entering addresses vulnerable to quantum. Automatic freezing of old coins that have not been moved for five years. The ability to selectively unlock these assets with quantum-resistant signatures. BTC holdings in Satoshi Nakamoto's known wallets. However, Lopp's proposal isn't the only solution. Anduro protocol engineer Hunter Beast has previously proposed a post-quantum address design with BIP 360, offering varying levels of security. Such solutions typically strike different balances between technical factors such as algorithm selection, key length, and transaction throughput. Like every BIP, this proposal must undergo intense debate and technical testing before implementation. Lopp argues that a successful quantum attack could cause massive economic disruption and that the Bitcoin community must unite and act quickly. However, post-quantum signatures come with much larger file sizes. This can increase transaction data and increase block space consumption. The entire infrastructure, from miners to wallets, needs to be aligned. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-19T07:18:43,"Bitcoin Price Could Hit New Highs by July-End, Says Galaxy Digital","The post Bitcoin Price Could Hit New Highs by July-End, Says Galaxy Digital appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s recent rally to a fresh all-time high of $123K has sparked optimism, but the mood across the market is currently mixed. The cryptocurrency is now consolidating near $118,000, and according to Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey, this could be a “pause for air” before another potential leg up by the end of July. Will Bitcoin Price Hit a New All-Time High Before July Ends? Michael Harvey , head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, believes Bitcoin could still hit a new all-time high before the month ends, but only if several bullish conditions align. He describes the most optimistic path as a “slow melt-up,” powered by continuous inflows into U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , ongoing accumulation by Bitcoin treasury firms, and a noticeable increase in retail investor interest. ETF flows have been strong, and institutional accumulation remains consistent, supporting the bullish outlook. However, retail activity, typically a key driver of Bitcoin blow-off tops, is still uncertain. While Coinbase has climbed to #137 on the Apple App Store, indicating rising curiosity among retail users, Google Trends data shows that searches for “Bitcoin” remain relatively low. Could Bitcoin Price Drop to $110K Before the Next Rally? Harvey also outlined a cautious view. A pullback triggered by profit-taking or broader equity market weakness could drag Bitcoin down 5–10%, putting $110,000 at risk. Such a correction wouldn’t necessarily end the bull market, but it would signal temporary weakness and a break in momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: How High Can ETH Really Go by 2026? , Will the Bitcoin Bull Run Peak in October 2025? Adding to the broader outlook, crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests this cycle might peak in October, roughly 550 days after the April 2024 halving , following the same timeline as the 2020 cycle. This implies we only have a few months of strong upward movement left before the cycle matures. This could be true because Bitcoin still holds a massive $2.33 trillion market cap with $81.67 billion in daily trading volume, reflecting strong institutional confidence. The 18.9% volume surge shows ongoing professional interest, even as prices pull back from recent highs. CryptoQuant notes that the Short-Term Holder MVRV ratio is currently below the profit-taking threshold (~1.35), suggesting Bitcoin still has room to climb 20–25%. With the recent consolidation resting on solid technical footing, a rally into the $140K+ range remains a viable target. For now, Bitcoin sits in a wait-and-see phase. Whether it’s gearing up for another July breakout or simply catching its breath, the next few weeks could determine how the rest of this bull run unfolds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In their Q2 2025 earnings reports, the three major banks disclosed billions of dollars in losses from “net charge-offs” — loans written off as uncollectible after all efforts to recover payments proved unsuccessful. Among the trio, JPMorgan Chase reported the highest level of charge-offs at $2.4 billion, predominantly driven by bad credit card debt. Meanwhile, Citi wiped $2.234 billion in bad loans off its books, including $1.889 billion tied to its retail credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo recorded $977 million in net charge-offs, fueled by $818 million in sour loans from its consumer banking and lending segment. The figures come as fresh data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that US credit card balances reached $1.18 trillion by the end of March 2025. Despite the losses, Citi reported a $225 million decline in net credit losses quarter-over-quarter, and Wells Fargo saw a $12 million decrease in net charge-offs over the same period. However, JPMorgan witnessed an increase of at $179 million in net charge-offs over the three-month period. Additionally, the three banks reported strong earnings in Q2, with JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo generating $15 billion, $4 billion and $5.5 billion in net income, respectively.

2025-07-19T07:00:30,"WisdomTree Report Reveals How Much XRP Must Climb to Surpass Bitcoin","A recent report from WisdomTree compared the technical capabilities of XRP and Bitcoin, offering a perspective on how XRP could potentially challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. The document emphasized XRP’s significant edge in transaction speed. It compares XRP’s throughput of 1,500 transactions per second to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second. XRP is significantly more efficient than Bitcoin, and the document says it consistently outperformed Bitcoin in transaction volume per second over several years. It also made it clear that XRP’s efficiency positions it as a strong candidate for real-time payments, while Bitcoin’s slower pace reflects a focus on decentralization and security. The 20x Price Challenge Toward the end of the document, WisdomTree laid out a stark comparison: “To match bitcoin’s market capitalisation, XRP’s price would need to increase more than 20x from its current levels.” At the time the report was prepared, Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.9 trillion. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher, brought renewed attention to this analysis in a recent post, pointing to WisdomTree’s statement as documentation of XRP’s potential. Remember, XRP only has to 20x from current price levels to surpass Bitcoin. Documented by WisdomTree. https://t.co/KttXOWzP13 pic.twitter.com/yoIKPQs02E — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 17, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is a 20x Surge Enough to Flip Bitcoin With XRP currently priced at $3.59 and its market cap sitting at $212.27 billion, a 20x increase would put its price at $71.80. Multiplying that by the current circulating supply (approximately 59.13 billion XRP), the projected market cap would reach roughly $4.24 trillion. By comparison, Bitcoin is now trading at $120,423, with a total market cap of $2.39 trillion. This means that if XRP were to 20x from current levels, its market cap would not only surpass Bitcoin’s, but it would do so by a significant margin of nearly $1.85 trillion. Experts have predicted for years that XRP could surpass Bitcoin , and this calculation reveals that, at least in theory, the 20x growth model referenced by WisdomTree now exceeds what is required to overtake Bitcoin. Outlook for XRP’s Trajectory The WisdomTree report made clear that for XRP to reach this level realistically, four major developments are essential. These include mass adoption, regulatory clarity, ecosystem expansion, and favorable market sentiment. These conditions remain as critical now as they were when the report was first issued. While the goal is daunting, especially considering Bitcoin’s deep-rooted dominance, current price levels suggest that a 20x rise in XRP would be more than sufficient to claim the top spot. XRP is already on its way to a new all-time high , and many market participants are confident that it will surpass Bitcoin in this cycle.
