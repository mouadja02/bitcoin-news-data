2025-07-19T09:43:01,"Wisconsin is considering new regulations to protect residents from crypto ATM scams","Wisconsin is currently considering new laws to protect its residents from the menace of crypto scams. According to reports, residents in Wisconsin have lost thousands to the growing crypto scam, showing the need for better regulations that aim to protect them from losing more. The sheriff‚Äôs office in central Wisconsin also discussed the rise in fraud related to Bitcoin in the region, noting that one person lost as much as $40,000 in a single case. ‚ÄúHaving these restrictions is only going to provide financial safety for our Community, and we‚Äôre super excited that someone‚Äôs moving forward with that,‚Äù said Investigative Lt. Scott Goldberg. Wisconsin set to unveil new laws to tackle crypto scams According to a newly proposed law , Bitcoin Treasury Machines are expected to be restricted, which means that if someone loses funds through one of these machines, the cryptocurrency company will refund the victim. In addition, the newly proposed regulation will also require every cryptocurrency machine company to post signs warning users about fraudulent transactions. Under the bill, only $1,000 in BTC can be sent at in a day, and fees charged by crypto firms will be reduced per transaction. Cryptocurrency fraud has been on the rise in the past few years, and fraud prevention experts have pointed to crypto ATMs as one of the favorite tools that scammers are now using to facilitate their crime. This is because these machines do not undergo the same regulatory process as traditional ATMs, and victims are not covered under any type of insurance for losses. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no recovery, so that‚Äôs what makes these really, really difficult,‚Äù Scott Reeder, a loss prevention manager at UW Credit Union, said. ‚ÄúYou can do police reports, but it‚Äôs just a dead end. There‚Äôs so much of this going on that there‚Äôs no resources to even look into recovering these funds.‚Äù In the past year, victims lost about $247 million to scams involving crypto ATMs, according to the FBI. The report also showed that the number of complaints the FBI received in 2024 over scams on crypto ATMs doubled. ‚ÄúFive years ago, we hardly ever heard about these, and it‚Äôs been a constant incline since, and it‚Äôs getting more and more prevalent,‚Äù Reeder said. According to authorities, a West Allis native who did not want to reveal her name due to privacy concerns reportedly lost $850 to a scam via a cryptocurrency ATM. Authorities claimed that the woman received a call from a man claiming to be a police officer with a warrant for her arrest. The woman said that the man said she had failed to appear in court, noting that it could be as a result of her aged mother misplacing the summons. ‚ÄúMy mom has Alzheimer‚Äôs, and when he said the signature ‚Äî he couldn‚Äôt make out ‚Äî I thought it was my mom‚Äôs signature. So, I believed it right then and there,‚Äù she said. She added that she tried to investigate the claim, but every time she questioned him, he always dropped a subtle threat about her going to prison. She added that the scammer provided fake court paperwork to back his claim, asking her to clear up the situation by paying the fees she owed. To avoid being arrested, the man said she should wire the money from a nearby crypto ATM. ‚ÄúI knew nothing about Bitcoins,‚Äù Amy said. ‚ÄúI put the money in, and when I got back to the car, he proceeded to say he forgot something and wanted more money. And that‚Äôs when I snapped, and then he hung up the phone. And that‚Äôs when I knew I got scammed.‚Äù State Rep. Ryan Spaude, who authored the bill alongside Senator Kelda Roys, said if all the things proposed in the bill are adhered to, the rate of being defrauded via a crypto ATM drops drastically. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency is here and actively being used ‚Äî and we need to take steps to stop Wisconsinites from getting screwed,‚Äù Roys said. The Wisconsin Legislature is largely controlled by the Republicans, and without their support, the proposal may not become law. The next best thing for the sponsors of the bill is to look for cosponsors and hope to see bipartisan support for regulations for crypto ATMs. Meanwhile, Reeder has issued a warning to Wisconsin residents, urging them to stop and think before sending money to someone they have never met before using a crypto ATM under any circumstances. ‚ÄúIf something just doesn‚Äôt make sense, you know, slow down. Ask for advice. Ask your financial: ‚ÄòHey, does this make sense?‚Äô‚Äù he said.

The gap between broader market performance and PI‚Äôs subdued valuation highlights deeper technical and structural issues. With the open mainnet anticipated in 2025, understanding Pi‚Äôs current position and its post-launch potential is critical for any price forecast. What‚Äôs the reason behind the sluggish Pi price rally? Will it rebound and rise in the coming months? Why Pi Price Isn‚Äôt Surging with the Crypto Market In the times when most of the altcoins are attempting to rise above the local resistance and slip the persisting bearish trend, Pi price remains calm. This divergence is rooted in technical limitations and market structure. Here are some reasons why the PI price is failing to gain strong bullish momentum. Enclosed Mainnet: It operates in its enclosed mainnet phase, where the PI tokens are non-transferable, not accessible on public block explorers and restricted to Pi‚Äôs internal apps No Official Exchange Listing: The crypto is listed on IOU representations but not on the actual tradable tokens. These cannot be withdrawn to a real Pi wallet, are unverified by the Pi core team and do not reflect real supply/demand dynamics. No On-Chain Volume: Unlike the other cryptos, PI does not have exchange access, high on-chain activity, DeFi, staking or NFT integration. It has zero footprint or smart contract-based utility, which makes it limited to organic and speculative growth What Could Change in the Rest of 2025? With the open mainnet launch expected sometime in 2025, Pi may finally unlock its on-chain functionality, shifting from speculative mining to tradable tokenomics. Besides, the Pi Core team has hinted at phased token unlocking mechanisms, including vesting periods, locking up for early miners and on-chain staking to delay circulation. On the other hand, to gain long-term value, Pi needs to evolve into a smart contract-enabled layer 1. This requires developer SDKs, dApp onboarding via Pi browser and gas fee utility for PI. The broader the use cases, the higher the transactional demand, which will support value accrual to native tokens in late 2025 and beyond. Pi Price Prediction 2025: Does PI have an Upside Potential to $5? PI has been experiencing massive selling pressure since its launch, which has shaken the confidence of the investors. As a result, the price has been maintaining a strong descending trend with fewer chances of a rebound. With the bears dominating the rally, is it possible for the PI price to rise to $5 in 2025? As seen in the above chart, the price is extending the falling wedge as the bears are nullifying the attempt for a breakout each time. The Bollinger bands have squeezed, which suggests a drop in the volume and volatility. This usually results in a massive breakout, but in the case of PI one cannot expect a larger price action. Mainly because the RSI is trading extremely lower, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally. With this, the possibility of a strong upswing could not be feasible in the near future. However, the market sentiments could change with the launch of the mainnet and with this, the Pi Network price is expected to rise beyond the current highs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-pi-coin-price-remains-flat-while-bitcoin-hits-new-highs-what-2025-holds/,"TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

POL price predictions for 2025 suggest potential highs of $0.7655. Long-term forecasts indicate POL could reach $4.94 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network‚Äôs high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL‚Äôs price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framework of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview July 2025 Price Action for POL/USD Polygon Price Prediction 2026 ‚Äì 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $¬†0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $¬†0.00 Trading Volume $¬†1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 July 2025 Price Action for POL/USD As of early July 2025, the POL price has developed a golden cross after breaking out from a symmetrical triangle and inching towards the 200-day EMA in July. However, if conditions improve and POL successfully flips 200-day EMA bands, then in July, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.30 could be on the horizon. On the contrary, if POL fails to break through the 20-day EMA, it could retreat to $0.15, with further bearish pressure potentially pushing it below $0.10. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Polygon Price Action July 2025 $0.10 $0.20 $0.30 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 The POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE reveals that since December 2024, the price has plummeted over 70%, with Q1 2025 significantly contributing to this decline. However, a shift occurred in April 2025 as bullish forces began to emerge, pushing the price towards the 0.236 level-based resistance by mid-May. Despite these efforts, the Polygon price remained low in Q2. However, it prepared a symmetrical triangle pattern in the past few months, and with the recent broader market rally and improved transaction volume in the Polygon network, its token is rising towards the Fibonacci 0.236 mark after breaking out from the symmetrical triangle‚Äôs upper border and inching towards the 200-day EMA band in order to flip it for a long-term uprise. This period of optimism manifested since last week in June onwards as bullish conviction of investors returned in the market from geopolitical easing, sparking a 45% boost by the third week of July. Nevertheless, if conditions keep on improving and POL retests and breaks the 0.236 Fibonacci level, then it will register a Change in Character (ChoCh) in its trend and could aim for the Fibonacci 0.5 level in Q3. In a more optimistic scenario, if before Q4 ends, POL sustains past the 0.50 Fibonacci level, then it might hit targets at the 0.786 and even the 1.0 Fibonacci levels by the end of 2025. However, if it fails to break through the Fibonacci 0.236 level, the price could retreat to $0.15, and further bearish pressure could push it below $0.10.

Key Takeaways: Bullish filed for a U.S. IPO aiming to list on the NYSE under the ticker ‚ÄúBLSH.‚Äù The exchange reports over $2.5 billion in average daily trading volume in Q1 2025. Bullish‚Äôs IPO follows a wave of crypto companies going public amid growing institutional adoption. The firm, led by CEO Tom Farley, a former president of the New York Stock Exchange, plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúBLSH.‚Äù Originally a spinout of blockchain company Block.one, Bullish gained early backing from Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund and Thiel Capital, as well as investment from Nomura, crypto veteran Mike Novogratz, and others. Bullish Emerges as Top Crypto Exchange with $2.5 Billion Daily Volume According to the IPO filing, Bullish has quickly established itself among the top cryptocurrency exchanges, reporting average daily trading volumes exceeding $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025. The company claims it ranks in the top five for spot trading volumes of Bitcoin and Ether, competing with industry giants like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Since its launch, Bullish says total trading volume has surpassed $1.25 trillion. The company also made headlines last year when it acquired the crypto news outlet CoinDesk . This filing marks another significant milestone in the cryptocurrency sector‚Äôs ongoing push for mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. JUST IN: crypto exchange Bullish files for IPO.

Adding to the evolving regulatory landscape, former President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, introducing consumer protections for stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Crypto Leaders Welcome GENIUS Act Executives from Ondo Finance, Bitpanda, and Gluwa see the recent passage of the GENIUS Act as a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Ian De Bode, Ondo Finance‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer, called the bill ‚Äúthe beginning of a new regulatory era,‚Äù stressing that legal clarity has long been the biggest hurdle for full institutional involvement. He also noted the influential role of Patrick McHenry, who stood alongside President Trump during the bill‚Äôs signing, signaling the importance of this moment for the crypto industry. Bitpanda‚Äôs Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that regulatory progress in Washington has boosted investor confidence, fueling optimism not only in Bitcoin but also altcoins such as XRP and DOGE. He pointed out that broad market rallies require strong confidence, which clearer rules help provide.

2025-07-19T09:30:00,"MARO: Elevated Risk Due To Bitcoin Exposure","Summary MARO offers a massive 125% yield by harnessing MARA's volatility, but its synthetic option strategy carries high risk and caps upside potential. The ETF is best suited for aggressive income seekers, not for growth or capital preservation, due to its declining price and speculative underlying asset. Distributions are inconsistent and not tax-efficient, making MARO more appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts and those who can handle payout variability. I rate MARO a hold, given the speculative nature of MARA, crypto volatility, and the risk of capital deterioration if sentiment shifts negatively. Overview YieldMax funds have earned a reputation for providing investors with a dividend yield that can be life changing under the right circumstances. I've covered a ton of these funds in the past, and I've always avoided a few specific ETFs due to the speculative nature of the underlying business. YieldMax MARA Option Income Strategy ETF ( MARO ) is one of the ETFs that I avoided because of the level of uncertainty around the business and the large levels of volatility. However, it's this level of volatility that allows MARO to reward shareholders with a distribution rate that currently sits around 125%! MARO implements an option strategy that aims to harness the volatility of MARA Holdings ( MARA ). If you aren't familiar, MARA is one of the leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and digital asset technology companies in the world. The core of their business is essentially operating Bitcoin mining machines as well as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Additionally, the business holds a large Bitcoin treasury, which causes the share price of the stock to change rapidly. If we look at the price of Bitcoin and MARA below, we can see the clear correlation over the last few years. Data by YCharts As we all know, Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets on the planet, and this has always caused me to stay away from MARO. YieldMax funds have a poor reputation for deteriorating investor capital, and I feared that a decline in Bitcoin would cause MARO's price to collapse. While MARO is trading substantially below its inception price, the decline isn't nearly as bad as some YieldMax peers. MARO launched recently during December 2024, and the ETF has a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. Looking at the performance since inception, we can see how the price has declined by over 49%. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return still sits around a loss of 13%. So let's look at the fund strategy to determine whether or not MARO is worth the risk. Data by YCharts Fund Strategy MARO is a synthetic option ETF that is aimed at capturing the volatility of MARA. The term 'synthetic' means that MARO doesn't actually own any common shares of MARA, so it's essentially writing options on a stock it doesn't own. The synthetic nature of the fund means that there is an increased risk profile since MARO can experience price losses that are much larger than the actual declines that Mara Holdings. Over time, the price disconnect can increase substantially, especially if Bitcoin experiences a large run upward. So if you want exposure to Bitcoin or Mara Holdings, you'd be better off simply buying the underlying of each. For instance, MARO's holdings reveal that it doesn't actually hold any common shares or Bitcoin. MARO Holdings (YieldMax) MARO is best utilized by income investors that want to collect a high stream of cash flow. Investors should be aware that following the fund's price decline so far, the ETF is very unlikely to experience any sort of positive growth, price resilience, or stability in the future. The highly volatile nature of Bitcoin and MARA makes me certain that MARO isn't really useful for anything else except income generation. In order to generate the necessary income to fuel distributions, the fund chooses to simultaneously purchase ATM (at-the-money) call options and sell put options. The prospectus explains that in order to generate the option premiums, MARO sells OTM (out-of-the-money) call options that typically have a strike price somewhere between 0% and 15% above the current market price of MARA. The fund documents provided the helpful table below that can help explain the process. MARO Prospectus However, a significant drawback of option funds is the capped upside potential. Growth is essentially limited to whatever the selected strike price is. So if MARO writes an option and selects a strike price that is 5% above MARA's market price, but MARA increases by 15%, MARO's growth is capped at that 5% premium strike price. When this strategy is implemented over a prolonged bull market, MARO is aligned to underperform. The best-case scenario would be for MARA and Bitcoin to trade sideways or slowly rise for an extended period of time, so that MARO can capture both the growth while also rewarding shareholders with the premiums. Performance Scenarios And Risk Since MARO's inception is so recent, we are working with a limited performance history to reference. When including all distributions that were paid out, MARO's total return has closely tracked the overall performance of MARA Holdings. As we can see below, MARA has a total loss of about 12.4%, while MARO's total return sits at a loss slightly over 13%. There are a few scenarios that can play out here. Data by YCharts Scenarios MARA Holdings Rises In Value: In this scenario, MARO would likely underperform since the upside participation is capped by the option strategy. This is especially true if MARA's price appreciates rapidly over a short period of time. Additionally, as MARO's price increases, the distributions may also increase. This would be the most ideal scenario for the fund. Bitcoin stabilizes and MARA Trades Sideways: If prices were to remain flat for MARA, MARO would likely see lower payouts, but they would become more consistent in amount. Due to the generous payouts, there's a possibility that MARO's price would ultimately trend downward if the payouts were not reduced from their current levels. However, a sideways moving price would still provide an environment where the total return can be positive as the distributions are paid out every four weeks. MARA's Price Decline Continues: Bitcoin has crossed new highs recently, and if the price retracts from here, MARA is likely to also suffer from a downside move. In this scenario, I would expect higher levels of volatility and for MARO's distributions to remain in their elevated range. However, the total return of MARO is likely to remain negative, depending on how drastic the downside movement is. These are all theoretical possibilities for MARO, and I've used the performance of other YieldMax funds as a reference. MARO isn't the only fund that has some sort of indirect exposure to the crypto markets, so there are plenty of examples to choose from. Some of YieldMax's relevant funds with indirect crypto exposure are the following: Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ): Writes options on Strategy ( MSTR ), which also has a ton of Bitcoin exposure. YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ): Writes options on Coinbase ( COIN ). YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ): Aims to directly seek exposure to the price of Bitcoin. YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ): Tracks a portfolio of crypto industry and technology companies. Looking at the price history of these peers below, we can see a very similar story play out on a YTD basis. The history below is limited due to the fact that LFGY was recently launched in January of 2025. Despite Bitcoin being up YTD, all of the mentioned funds below have seen their price decline. These comparisons are just to demonstrate that this is the inherent risk involved with synthetic option ETFs. The price is very likely to see continued downside, even if the underlying assets they track appreciate in value over time. Data by YCharts This is why I want to put emphasis on the fact that MARO should only be utilized by investors that specifically seek income. A fund like MARO may not be a simple buy and hold position, especially due to MARA's speculative nature. Unlike businesses like Coinbase, MARA Holdings doesn't have the most reassuring earnings history . MARA has sporadic revenues and operating expenses that can be difficult to predict every quarter. While there may be short-term catalysts for the company, MARA isn't a stock that I personally feel confident in holding for an extended period. In comparison, a company like Coinbase has different revenue streams that help create a healthier looking balance sheet . Despite all of the optimism in the crypto markets this year, the Bitcoin cycle can shift. If there is a large retraction in the price of Bitcoin, I anticipate that MARO will experience a sizeable decline. As the price declines, so will the distributions, which makes it harder to turn a profit on this fund. So while I am fairly optimistic on the future of crypto, I would prefer to initiate a position in MARO when the cycle isn't at the height of its optimism. Dividend Utility As of the latest declared distribution of $2.3718 per share, the estimated annual yield currently sits around a whopping 125%. When we talk about a dividend yield this high, the ultimate end goal would be to reach 'house money' status. This is the cross point where you receive 100% of your initial investment back in the form of distributions. Since MARO offers a yield that is over 100%, an investor should technically be able to collect their initial investment back in less than twelve months, assuming that payouts remain the same. The only issue is that payouts tend to be wildly different every four weeks. A new payout is declared every four weeks and is determined by the underlying success of the option strategy, the price movement of MARA, and overall market volatility. As we can see below, the payouts have been varied since the fund's inception. Only four weeks ago, MARO experienced the lowest payout since the fund's inception, so conditions around the yield can change rapidly. MARO Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) If you haven't already, I would highly suggest going to the YieldMax site and reaching out to them to request being added to the distribution list. You will receive emails that detail the specific payouts each week. As we can see below, the latest distribution brings the estimated annual rate to slightly over 125% and was paid out on 7/18/2025. What stands out the most to me is that 0% of the distribution was funded using the return of capital. MARO Distribution Announcement (YieldMax) Usually, YieldMax funds put an emphasis on return of capital because they reduce the overall tax burden that investors have to deal with. For instance, I previously covered YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSFO ) and over 92% of the distribution was paid using return of capital. Distributions are likely classified as net investment income, which is considered to be ordinary dividend income. Therefore, we can assume that the majority of the distributions received from MARO will not be tax-efficient, and a position may be best utilized within a tax-advantaged account. Takeaway In conclusion, I rate MARO as a hold for now due to the speculative nature of the underlying focus on MARA Holdings. The fund will also be influenced by the movement of Bitcoin, and I am concerned about how MARO will perform if the crypto sentiment shifts. If Bitcoin and MARA experience a sizeable retraction, MARO will continue to deteriorate investor capital over time. Additionally, the distributions aren't tax-efficient, which means investors may need to consider the possibility of a larger tax burden at the end of the year.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802446-maro-elevated-risk-due-to-bitcoin-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","MARA|BTC-USD|MSTY|MSTR|CONY|COIN|YBIT|LFGY|MARO",cryptocompare

2025-07-19T09:22:31,"Bitcoin at ATH, XRP at $3‚ÄîBut Next-Gen Presale XYZVerse Could Crack the $1 Billion Market Cap","The cryptocurrency market is witnessing unprecedented milestones as leading coins reach remarkable levels. Amidst Bitcoin's surge and XRP's impressive performance, a new contender emerges. The presale of XYZVerse is capturing attention with the potential to attain a $1 billion market cap. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to explore what this next-generation platform brings to the table. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse‚Äôs potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch.

A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings ‚Äì If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth ‚Äì Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions ‚Äì If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Bitcoin Unveiled: How Digital Currency is Changing Finance Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. It was created by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows people to send money directly to each other without using a bank. Instead of physical coins, it exists as a record on a shared system called the blockchain. This means everyone can see all the transactions, making it transparent. To make sure transactions are real, people called miners solve difficult puzzles to confirm them. When they do, they earn new bitcoins as a reward. This process helps keep the system safe from fraud. Bitcoin has a lot of potential to change how we use money. By removing the need for banks, it can make transactions faster and cheaper. The number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which can make it valuable like gold. Every four years, the rewards for miners are cut in half, a process known as ""halving."" This can affect how profitable it is to mine bitcoins and can influence the market. Right now, many people are interested in Bitcoin because of its unique features and potential for growth. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin remains the leader and could be an attractive option in the current market. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency Shaping Global Payments XRP is making waves as a cryptocurrency designed for quick, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it's a digital currency that's open and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the company that received 80 billion XRP from the founders, uses the currency to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem. By placing 55 billion XRP in escrow, Ripple ensures a controlled release of the currency into the market, reflecting its commitment to stability and growth. In the current market, XRP's potential stands out due to its unique features. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, it doesn't require a bank account for settlements and operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. Its ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies aligns with global trends toward faster and more efficient transactions. Compared to coins like Bitcoin, which can have slower transaction times and higher fees, XRP offers a compelling alternative. As the demand for digital payment solutions grows, XRP's technology and vision position it as an attractive option to watch in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Conclusion Bitcoin and XRP are thriving, but XYZVerse's pioneering sports memecoin could achieve exceptional growth, uniting fans across sports in a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

The analytics platform says that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, the next major resistance level for the crypto king stands below $140,000. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. ‚ÄúAssuming current momentum remains strong, the next key resistance lies at the +2 standard deviation band, which is currently trading around $136,000.‚Äù Source: Glassnode Glassnode, however, says that while there‚Äôs potential for another leg higher for Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset could form a near-term top as short-term holders are sitting on significant unrealized profits. ‚ÄúBitcoin has broken to new [all-time highs] ATHs, and has cleared above two major accumulation zones. This represents a significant market move, which tends to be followed by strong positive momentum. However, short-term holders, being the more price-sensitive cohort, are now seeing their unrealized profit reaching marginally overheated levels, making the incentive for them to sell and take profit increasingly likely.‚Äù According to Glassnode, the percentage of short-term holder supply of Bitcoin in profit is currently at 95%, seven percentage points above the long-term mean of 88%. ‚ÄúIf this metric begins to stabilize or decline below the 88% level, it could be an early signal of weakening demand or distribution taking hold.‚Äù Source: Glassnode Bitcoin is trading at $117,810 at time of writing.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Mericle says he expects the Fed to make three rate cuts this year, starting in two months, as he predicts tariff-driven inflation will be transitory. ‚ÄúI think the latest batch of data suggests that the stakes are not hugely high at the moment, that the economy, the labor market at least, doesn‚Äôt seem to be in need of great rate cuts. But the inflation data, from my perspective, suggests that we‚Äôre doing just fine, and that the underlying trend is moving back towards something closer to 2% ‚Äì even if tariff effects are and are likely to continue to give us a little bit of a boost on top of that. We still have three cuts penciled in for later this year. I think they could start in September, because I‚Äôm relaxed about the inflation news. I think we are moving in the right direction for reasons many economists anticipated; supply and demand, especially in the labor market, are back in balance. We‚Äôre seeing the end of catch-up inflation, and I‚Äôm not worried about tariffs unanchoring inflation expectations, but I do think you are seeing those effects show up from month to month.‚Äù Mericle also says that one reason why tariff impacts will be short-lived is that the economic conditions, particularly in the labor market, are much different from what they were about three years ago when inflation soared. ‚ÄúThe actual boost to inflation, especially against a backdrop where the economy is not nearly facing the same degree of labor market tightness as it did back when we all worried about this in 2022, probably means that the tariff effects are not going to spark a long, prolonged period of high inflation.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
