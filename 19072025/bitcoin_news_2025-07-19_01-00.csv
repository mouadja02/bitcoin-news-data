2025-07-18T22:30:00,"China‚Äôs DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Hyperliquid by the End of July 2025","China‚Äôs leading AI platform DeepSeek predicts that prominent altcoins will achieve unprecedented price milestones in the latter half of 2025, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs exceptional rally. Earlier this week, Bitcoin set a new historical benchmark, reaching an all-time high of $122,838. Market analysts believe this bullish momentum could persist, further accelerating cryptocurrency adoption on a global scale. Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive ascent has sparked renewed enthusiasm among investors, with speculation mounting that the ongoing rally could eclipse the legendary bull run of 2021, propelling top altcoins to fresh valuation peaks. Outlined below are the digital currencies that China‚Äôs cutting-edge DeepSeek AI predicts to deliver strong gains in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): China‚Äôs DeepSeek AI Predicts Massive Upside for the Cross-Border Payments Giant DeepSeek‚Äôs latest forecasts suggest Ripple‚Äôs XRP could soar to $5 by the end of 2025‚Äîa remarkable leap from its current value around $3.45, however this is likely too conservative, given that XRP set a new ATH earlier today of $3.65, its first high watermark since it hit $3.40 back in 2018. DeepSeek‚Äôs projection is also a quarter of that of its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which suggests heights of $20. XRP has solidified its reputation as a fast, affordable, and regulator-friendly cross-border transaction solution. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) acknowledged XRP‚Äôs capability to facilitate rapid global payments without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR ‚Äî JackTheRippler ¬© (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark court ruling in 2023 declared that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions, effectively undermining the SEC‚Äôs long-standing stance against Ripple and bolstering confidence across the altcoin market. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse officially announced the SEC dropped the four-year case, removing regulatory uncertainty for XRP and setting a precedent for all other altcoins. However, achieving the ambitious $20 target will require a major catalyst, such as regulatory reform in the U.S., where the crypto industry continues to advocate for comprehensive legal frameworks. XRP has been on a strong upward trajectory, climbing 7% over the past 24 hours and 55% in the last fortnight, driven largely by substantial whale accumulation. These large-scale purchases have pushed its relative strength index (RSI) to a heated 89, suggesting potential profit-taking ahead that will depreciate its price. However, the previous $3 resistance level is likely to switch to a strong psychological support level, priming XRP to run up to $5 by mid-fall and possibly even $20 by year end. . Over the past year, XRP has delivered an impressive 499% gain, far exceeding Bitcoin‚Äôs 83% rise, and remains the best-performing multibillion-cap crypto asset this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Founding Meme Coin Set for Major Breakout Dogecoin ($DOGE) , originally launched as a lighthearted parody in 2013, now commands a robust market capitalisation of over $36.6 billion, driven by a devoted community and increasing utility. Typically mirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends, DOGE blends meme-fuelled volatility with long-term resilience. Trading currently at $0.2438, Dogecoin has risen by 14% in the past 24 hours and 19% over the past week. With an RSI of 81 it‚Äôs likely to follow XRP into a slight dip which will ultimately help to consolidate its gains while providing profits for its supporters. Chart analysis reveals a distinct falling wedge pattern from November through April, suggesting a likely breakout in the near term. DeepSeek AI predicts DOGE reaching as high as $1 during an extended bull phase, which would equate to a potential 4X gain from its current valuation. In terms of adoption, Dogecoin continues to attract high-profile support. Tesla accepts DOGE payments for select merchandise, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE for transactions, enhancing its practical use case. China‚Äôs DeepSeek AI Predicts The $HYPE Token Powering the Eponymous Crypto Millionaire-Maker DEX Will Go Higher Yet Since launching late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have emerged as standout players in the decentralised exchange (DEX) arena. It currently trades at $45 but DeepSeek expects it to hit $100 by the New Year. Operating on its own proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Hyperliquid ensures full user custody over funds‚Äîan increasingly critical factor following the collapse of major centralised exchanges like FTX. Offering competitive fees, lightning-fast trade execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid combines the best of decentralised and centralised exchange platforms. Technical analysis, since its debut, shows robust bullish trends. Two bullish flag patterns formed between late winter and early spring, typically signalling sharp upward price moves. Indeed, between early April and May 26, $HYPE quadrupled in value, jumping from around $10 to $40. This rally was reinforced by multiple cup and handle formations, suggesting sustained interest from institutional-sized traders. Highlighting its potential, one Hyperliquid user recently netted $7 million from a $200 million long position on BTC and ETH using 50x leverage, demonstrating the platform‚Äôs capacity to deliver transformational profits. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The First Meme-Driven Layer 2 for Bitcoin Gathers Steam Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as a novel force in the altcoin space, combining viral meme culture with innovative Layer 2 technology built natively on Bitcoin. Designed to boost transaction speed and scalability while infusing the ecosystem with playful energy, it is pioneering new use cases for Bitcoin-based applications. The project has already raised over around $3.4 million during its presale, with many predicting a potential 10X launch surge upon listing. Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper aims to resolve Bitcoin‚Äôs well-known limitations of slow transaction speeds and high fees, enabling high-performance smart contracts. Its Canonical Bridge allows for instant BTC transfers by routing transactions through its proprietary Layer 2, while its ultra-low gas fees support diverse applications ranging from decentralised apps (dApps) to meme coins and payment solutions. The project has also undergone a smart contract audit by Coinsult, which reported no vulnerabilities, bolstering investor confidence. The $HYPER token is central to its ecosystem, enabling staking rewards, transaction fee payments, and access to exclusive platform features. Presale participants are offered exceptionally high yields, with APYs reaching up to 269%, alongside governance privileges, providing attractive incentives for early backers.

2025-07-18T22:26:43,"S&P 500 closes with another all-time high, led by crypto stocks amid euphoric wins","The S&P 500 locked in its ninth all-time closing high of 2025 on Thursday, climbing 0.54% to 6,297.36, as crypto stocks ripped higher, and investors got slammed with better-than-expected earnings. Nasdaq Composite ended at 20,885.65, up 0.75%, posting its tenth record of the year. The Dow Jones added 229.71 points, or 0.52%, to close at 44,484.49, with all three major indexes pushing through new intraday highs before the bell rang. Trump‚Äôs GENIUS Act, signed into law the same day at the White House, lit a match under crypto stocks, triggering a sharp rise in names like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Bitmine Immersion. The bill, which has been called the first full-scale crypto regulation ever passed in the United States, got an official ceremony attended by politicians and industry leaders. Trump‚Äôs action now locks crypto oversight into federal law, something future presidents can‚Äôt just brush off. Noelle Acheson, economist and author of Crypto is Macro Now , said, ‚ÄúThis is the biggest deal in crypto so far this year, up there with the change in the SEC ‚Äì it‚Äôs the first crypto-focused law in the history of the United States, home to the largest financial market in the world.‚Äù She added that: ‚ÄúBeing law rather than an agency ruling means that future Administrations will not be able to easily overturn its provisions. Should any try, by then stablecoins will be so deeply embedded in the global financial landscape, it would be futile.‚Äù Coinbase touches intraday high, Ether leads crypto run Coinbase saw a 2% gain by close and even spiked above the high it hit during its IPO debut in 2021, making it five straight positive weeks for the company. Robinhood closed 4% higher, while Bitmine Immersion, which manages ether reserves, added 1%. The jump came after Trump‚Äôs signing, which investors saw as a regulatory green light. Despite the crypto euphoria, bitcoin slipped 1%, weighing on firms tied directly to the coin. Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, dropped 6%, while Mara Holdings, a mining firm viewed as a bitcoin proxy, fell 2%. The contrast came as Ether dominated the spotlight, soaring 18% this week alone. That rally brings ether‚Äôs two-week performance to 43.6%, its strongest showing since August 2021. Bitcoin, for the same two-week stretch, is slightly down. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act ‚Äî a separate, more comprehensive bill covering crypto market structures ‚Äî passed the House of Representatives and is now heading to the Senate, which will then send it to Trump, if approved. Jobless claims fall, retail sales beat expectations Outside crypto, the day‚Äôs economic reports gave traders more reason to stay risk-on. The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending July 12 dropped by 7,000, landing at 221,000. That decline hints that layoffs haven‚Äôt picked up despite all the noise about rate hikes and inflation. It also helped prop up the narrative that the labor market isn‚Äôt breaking. Another surprise came from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported that retail sales in June rose 0.6% from May. That‚Äôs triple the 0.2% estimate that Dow Jones analysts had projected. Consumers are still spending, and that‚Äôs keeping companies happy, and investors, even happier. That spending is starting to show up in corporate earnings. Roughly 50 S&P 500 companies have reported results so far, and 88% of them beat expectations, as tracked by FactSet. Big names like PepsiCo, which gained 7% on Thursday, and United Airlines, which added 3%, were standout winners. By the end of the week, the S&P 500 is projected to be up 0.6%, with the Dow eyeing a 0.3% gain. But the real winner is the Nasdaq, which is leading all three major indexes with a 1.5% rise so far in the week. That makes tech ‚Äî and by extension, crypto stocks ‚Äî the market‚Äôs top performers again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

(NYSE: XYZ), an American tech company founded by Jack Dorsey and best known for the creation of Cash App, will replace Hess Corp. (NYSE: HSE) in the S&P 500 index. The removal of the energy company was instituted after it was acquired by Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX). Beginning on Wednesday, July 23, the XYZ stock will be included in the S&P 500 index. As a result, Block Inc., will join Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), which joined the index in mid May 2025. Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Block Introduces Bitcoin to Mainstream Institutional Investors According to market aggregate data from BitcoinTreasuries , Block Inc., has held 8,585 Bitcoins, worth about $1.01 billion, since October 7 2020. The company purchased its Bitcoin trove at an average price of about $30,405, thus achieving a profit of nearly 300 percent. The inclusion of the Block Inc. into the S&P 500 index will, therefore, play a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of BTC by institutional investors. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market has received much needed legal clarity, especially after President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act . Following the announcement, the XYZ stock market gained 10 percent in the after hours on Friday to trade about $79.49. The large-cap company, with a market valuation of about $43 billion, has seen its stock rally over 35 percent in the past three months.

2025-07-18T22:00:24,"Bitcoin Realised Cap Hits $1T All‚ÄëTime High: Strong Capital Base For Growth","Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below the psychological $120,000 level, cooling off after last week‚Äôs surge to a new all-time high. While bulls maintain control, price action has slowed, giving room for Ethereum to take the spotlight with a sharp breakout above $3,600. Amid this evolving environment, fresh on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights a historic moment for Bitcoin. The network‚Äôs Realised Cap ‚Äî a metric that values each coin at the price it last moved ‚Äî hit a new all-time high. This milestone underscores the growing strength and maturity of Bitcoin‚Äôs capital base, especially as institutional interest and long-term holding trends continue to rise. To add a bullish note, this¬†period of consolidation follows a major regulatory development: the US House of Representatives has officially passed three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS and Clarity Acts, ushering in long-awaited legal clarity for digital assets. A Signal of Bitcoin‚Äôs Growing Maturity Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a significant milestone for Bitcoin: the network‚Äôs Realised Cap has officially surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in its history, marking a new all-time high. Unlike traditional market capitalization ‚Äî which multiplies the current price by total supply ‚Äî Realised Cap calculates the value of each coin based on the price at which it was last moved. This methodology offers a clearer and more grounded view of the capital that is actually invested and held within the Bitcoin network. Adler explains that this metric filters out speculative extremes and emphasizes coins that are truly being held by market participants, making it a more reliable indicator of Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying strength. To illustrate the significance of this milestone, he notes: ‚ÄúIf a company earned $1 every second, it would take 31,710 years to accumulate one trillion dollars.‚Äù This comparison puts into perspective the immense scale of value now stored within the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Bitcoin consolidates below $120,000 following its recent all-time high, the rise in Realised Cap reinforces the idea that this cycle is built on a stronger foundation than in previous rallies. With increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity emerging in the US, and growing long-term holder conviction, many analysts believe that Bitcoin is on the verge of another expansive growth phase in the coming months. BTC Price Consolidates After Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is currently consolidating below the psychological $120,000 level after a strong multi-week rally. The 12-hour chart shows BTC trading between a clear range, with resistance at $123,230 and support at $115,730. This horizontal structure signals a healthy pause after a significant move, allowing the market to digest gains and potentially prepare for the next leg higher. Despite minor pullbacks within the range, price action remains above all key moving averages: the 50 SMA ($111,306), the 100 SMA ($108,314), and the 200 SMA ($102,603), all trending upward. This alignment suggests bullish momentum remains intact, with the 50 SMA acting as dynamic support during shallow corrections. Volume remains elevated compared to earlier in July, indicating continued participation and strong interest from buyers. As long as BTC maintains its structure above the $115K‚Äì$116K region, bulls are likely to remain in control. A confirmed breakout above $123,230 could open the door to new all-time highs, while a breakdown below $115,730 might trigger short-term downside toward $111K.

2025-07-18T22:00:12,"Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins","Tom Lee devoted a six-post thread on X yesterday to a single proposition: if companies treat Ethereum (ETH) the way MicroStrategy treats bitcoin, the token price need only follow the mathematics of balance-sheet absorption to reach roughly $30,000. Lee‚Äôs argument rests on the mechanics he says really powered MicroStrategy‚Äôs spectacular equity rerating. From 11 August 2020 through today the software company‚Äôs shares climbed from $13 to about $455, a 35-fold gain. Only eleven of those thirty-five turns came from bitcoin‚Äôs own rise‚Äîroughly $11,000 to $118,000 in the same period‚Äîwhile twenty-five turns were created by ‚Äútreasury strategy,‚Äù Lee wrote, meaning repeated financings that increased BTC per share even faster than the coin‚Äôs spot price. Ethereum To $30,000? Lee lists three moves that made the template work and, in his view, will be even more potent for ETH: issuing new stock above net-asset value to acquire more tokens, exploiting token volatility to lower borrowing costs, and relying on convertibles or preferred shares to cap dilution. Because ether‚Äôs realised volatility still exceeds bitcoin‚Äôs, Lee argues the cost of debt-and-option structures used to lever the treasury can be driven lower still, accelerating token accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May‚Äôs Playbook Predicts Another Breakout In the same thread he reposted a chart showing that his own vehicle, BitMine Immersion Technologies, purchased four times more notional value in its first week of activity ($1 billion in ETH) than MicroStrategy bought in its first week of bitcoin purchases back in 2020. BitMine‚Äôs numbers illustrate the scale. A regulatory filing and follow-up press release on 17 July confirmed the company now holds 300,657 ETH‚Äîjust over $1 billion at the time of publication‚Äîafter closing a $250 million private placement on 8 July. Lee, who chairs BitMine‚Äôs board, said the firm is ‚Äúwell on our way to acquiring and staking five per cent of the overall ETH supply.‚Äù The second-largest treasurer is SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. On 17 July the company updated its SEC prospectus to increase the stock it can sell from $1 billion to $6 billion, saying proceeds will fund additional ETH purchases. SharpLink had already raised $413 million between 7 and 11 July and disclosed 280,706 ETH on its books as of 13 July, all but a few hundred of which are staked for yield. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Bit Digital rounds out the trio. After a $172 million underwritten share sale on 7 July and the liquidation of 280 bitcoin, the Nasdaq-listed miner reported a treasury of 100,603 ETH and declared its intention to become ‚Äúthe pre-eminent ETH holding company in the world,‚Äù according to chief executive Sam Tabar. Taken together, the three firms now control roughly 682,000 ETH, or about half a per cent of the circulating supply, and each has active authorisations to issue more equity or debt expressly for ether accumulation. Lee insists the reflexive loop this creates‚Äîhigher share prices providing ever-cheaper capital that buys still more token per share‚Äîcan compress the time it takes for price to capture scarcity. Crypto analyst DCInvestor, responding to Lee‚Äôs thread, distilled the mathematics into a range: ‚ÄúTom Lee basically calling for like $30-80K ETH. And some of you think we are gonna stop $1-2K after last cycle‚Äôs all-time high.‚Äù Ether changes hands today near $3,600. An eight-fold move to $30,000 would merely replicate the multiple that bitcoin logged between MicroStrategy‚Äôs first treasury purchase and its 2021 peak. The difference, Lee argues, is that MicroStrategy spent four years proving the model; Ethereum treasuries have taken less than two months to raise their first few billion dollars.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a breakout coin, exploding in both investor interest and trading volume amid the broader rally. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 80% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.6 million has been raised to date, and over 13600 investors have entered the presale. As Bitcoin regain momentum, it‚Äôs the unexpected rise of Mutuum Finance that‚Äôs turning heads and challenging narratives in 2025‚Äôs shifting digital asset market. Bitcoin Price Path: $150K Still in Sight as Rally Pauses Bitcoin is currently hovering around $118,345 after reaching fresh all-time highs near $123,100, driven by surging institutional demand, especially via ETFs and corporate treasury accumulation, and growing regulatory clarity under recent U.S. crypto legislation. Technical indicators suggest momentum may cool soon: RSI and MACD patterns point to consolidation above $115,000‚Äì$116,000 support zones, with a potential ceiling near $122,000‚Äì$123,000 resistance. Looking ahead, analysts forecast a moderate upside, targets range from $125K‚Äì$130K this quarter, and even $145K‚Äì$200K by year‚Äëend, assuming continued ETF inflows and policy backing. Still, short‚Äëterm retracements can‚Äôt be ruled out, especially if macro sentiment shifts or profit‚Äëtaking accelerates. Fueled by Investors: Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $12.6‚ÄØM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.6 million raised and over 13600 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03.
