2025-07-19T11:46:53,"Charles Schwab Enters Crypto War, Launching Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum Trading","The post Charles Schwab Enters Crypto War, Launching Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum Trading appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Charles Schwab, one of America’s largest brokerage firms with $10.7 trillion in client assets, is moving closer to offering direct (spot) trading in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, CEO Rick Wurster just confirmed Schwab will soon launch spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, hoping to help clients keep all their money, stocks, bonds, and crypto in one trusted place. Schwab Launches Bitcoin & Ethereum Trading In a recent CNBC interview, Wurster noted that Schwab’s clients already hold significant exposure to crypto through exchange-traded products (ETPs), owning more than 20% of the entire ETP market. However, crypto still makes up a small slice of Schwab’s total assets, roughly $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion. Schwab thinks giving them simple spot BTC and ETH trading “sometime soon” will unlock new growth. JUST IN: $10 trillion Charles Schwab CEO says they will launch Bitcoin trading ""sometime soon"" and will be competing with Coinbase pic.twitter.com/VnpHfcFed0 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 18, 2025 The timing is perfect as rules for crypto are becoming clearer. The U.S. House recently passed the GENIUS Act , setting new rules for stablecoins. Along with relaxed restrictions from banking regulators, this has made it easier for companies like Schwab to move into crypto. Competing With Coinbase Schwab’s entry into spot crypto trading is aimed at challenging existing players like Coinbase. After listing Bitcoin and Ether ETFs and allowing related funds and options, adding direct coins is the next step. Wurster stated that many Schwab clients currently store 98% of their wealth with the brokerage but keep a small portion of crypto with other exchanges. They would rather view everything, stocks, ETFs, options, and now coins, in one secure dashboard. Institutions Add More Crypto The push toward crypto isn’t limited to Schwab. A March survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors plan to increase crypto allocations in 2025, with altcoins like XRP and Solana emerging as favorites. Another study found 90% are using or testing stablecoins. Schwab wants to be ready when these allocations shift from “experimental” to “standard.” Profits Rise as Schwab Grows Even though global crypto spot trading dipped last quarter, Schwab’s quarterly profit jumped 60%, EPS hit $1.14, client assets rose 14% to $10.76T, and trading revenue climbed 23% to $952M, partly boosted by heavy activity around new U.S. tariff news For Schwab, crypto isn’t just an add-on anymore, it’s becoming part of its main business plan for the future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/charles-schwab-enters-crypto-war-launching-spot-bitcoin-ethereum-trading/,"TRADING|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","News",cryptocompare

According to a newly updated settlement portal , the sports streaming firm FuboTV will send cash payments to people who had an account on or before May 29th of this year while residing in the US or its territories. The class action lawsuit leading to the settlement was initially filed in August of 2023. It alleged FuboTV “collected, stored, used, distributed, or retained Personally Identifiable Information and/or other personal information or data, including through targeted advertising and the use of Trap and Trace Devices, the Meta Pixel, Google Analytics, Cookies, and related technology.” According to the class action lawsuit, FuboTV’s actions were in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act – a law originally created to prevent the wrongful disclosure of videotape rental or sale records, but now also applies to streaming and digital video platforms as well. According to the settlement portal, the amount that each class member will receive is currently unknown but will depend on the number of valid claims that will be submitted. Claims must be submitted by September 12th, while the final approval hearing will be held on October 6th. Individuals who wish to exclude themselves from the settlement must submit a ‘Request for Exclusion’ by email or in writing by August 28th.

Ethereum is trading at $3,557 and XRP at $3.43, both showing minimal movement in the day. In a major move, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating the first clear U.S. framework for stablecoin regulation. This is expected to unlock a wave of institutional capital and accelerate crypto adoption. Ethereum Hits 6-Month High with 50% Rally Ethereum is making headlines and has jumped to a six-month high of $3,677 on July 18, marking a 50% rally since it dipped near $2,400 earlier this month. One big reason for its recent surge is the passage of the GENIUS Act, which finally brings some clear rules for stablecoins and is crucial for Ethereum’s ecosystem. Rising institutional interest and record inflows into spot ETH ETFs and staking activity are also fueling the price run. ETH ETFs Overtake Bitcoin in Daily Inflows For the first time ever, Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. On Thursday, US spot Ether ETFs pulled in $602 million, beating the $522.6 million that went into Bitcoin funds. The surge follows a record-setting $726 million inflow into ETH ETFs the day before. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in $550 million and outperforming its own Bitcoin product. James Seyffart noted the rise in demand for Ethereum ETFs and shared that they’ve pulled in over $5.5 billion since launch, with $3.3 billion of that coming in just since mid-April.

Since then, ETH has outperformed BTC by 70%, with more upside likely over the next 12–24 months.

Ethereum Treasuries Surge More companies are adopting Ethereum as a treasury asset, mirroring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. BitMine has acquired 300,000+ ETH, aiming to stake 5% of the total supply. SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital are also building large ETH reserves, raising billions to expand holdings. With both hype and real progress behind it, many analysts believe ETH’s rally may have much more room to run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-19T11:30:37,"Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details","Bitcoin is currently holding above the $115,000 level after setting a new all-time high of approximately $123,000 last Monday. The price structure remains firmly bullish, with buyers still in control, but growing signs suggest the potential for a short-term correction. Momentum has slowed, and the market is entering a consolidation phase as traders reassess risk. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miner selling has surged sharply. On July 15, the same day Bitcoin reached its latest peak, daily BTC inflows to exchanges jumped from 19,000 BTC to 81,000 BTC — a clear sign that major holders, including miners and whales, took advantage of high prices to offload assets. Notably, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC, the highest daily level since April, and nearly all of it was sent directly to exchanges. These inflows suggest a shift in sentiment among large players, raising the probability of increased supply pressure in the short term. While the broader trend remains intact, and fundamentals like long-term holder activity are still strong, the spike in exchange deposits is a classic signal to watch. Whether this leads to a deeper pullback or simply a healthy reset will likely be decided in the coming days. Miners Take Profits As Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin miners have resumed aggressive selling behavior as BTC reached a new all-time high of ~$123,000. On July 15, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC — the highest single-day total since April 7. This level of activity represents what analysts at CryptoQuant describe as an “extreme outflow,” indicating that miners seized the opportunity to take profits at elevated prices. The miners sent nearly all the BTC they withdrew from their wallets directly to centralized exchanges. This reinforces the interpretation that the move was not simply a strategic reallocation but an active decision to sell into market strength. Such behavior often signals growing caution among miners, who may expect either near-term price exhaustion or are simply capitalizing on favorable conditions after months of holding. Miner behavior has long been viewed as a leading indicator of potential market shifts. When outflows rise — particularly to exchanges — it tends to precede increased volatility or temporary tops. While the broader Bitcoin trend remains bullish and investor demand stays strong, this wave of miner selling injects a dose of uncertainty. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Top 30 Global Assets With $416B Market Cap – What’s Next? BTC Consolidates Below ATH After Explosive Rally The daily chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows price consolidating in a tight range between $115,730 and $123,230 after reaching a new all-time high. This zone is now acting as a short-term channel, with buyers defending the $115K area while facing resistance around $123K. The latest daily candle shows low volatility, suggesting indecision among traders as Bitcoin pauses after its recent breakout. Volume has tapered off following a massive spike that coincided with the all-time high breakout, a potential signal of exhaustion or reduced participation from large buyers. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $108,796 remains well below the current price, confirming the bullish momentum is still intact, but any breakdown below the $115K level could bring the 50-day SMA into focus as a potential support. Related Reading: All 40K Remaining Bitcoin From The 80K Whale Just Moved: $4.75B In One Wallet Now So far, the trend structure remains bullish, but with a growing number of analysts pointing to miner sales and whale activity, traders are closely monitoring price action for signs of a pullback or renewed breakout. If BTC can reclaim $123,230 with volume, the next leg up could follow. Until then, this consolidation may serve as a healthy cooldown before the next major move.

Solana and Sui led the crypto market rally of the past few years. Another cryptocurrency could outperform the other and lead the upcoming bull run. As Bitcoin leads a fresh market rally, one crypto analyst has identified strong similarities between today’s market conditions and those that preceded Bitcoin’s historic 23x price surge in 2017. Maybe not 23x, but something sensational coming for Bitcoin In his latest podcast , the analyst noted that while he doesn’t expect a direct repeat for Bitcoin itself, he believes the stage is set for a “sensational” bull run and for a new altcoin to deliver life-changing gains. The crypto analyst’s observations align with the dominant sentiment across the crypto community. Although most crypto investors do not expect Bitcoin to rally another 23x in 2025, they believe the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for something significant under current market conditions.

But the cryptocurrency is climbing higher and faster. That’s because its total market capitalization is much lower than the S&P 500’s, so it’s easier for bullish markets to move the needle. It’s also because Bitcoin is still relatively new and not as far along the adoption curve for its total addressable market as US stock favorites like Apple and Google. Here are four signs of a trillion-dollar sea change in Bitcoin valuations. 1. Bitcoin Price Historical All-Time High After hitting its ATH, Bitcoin’s market cap floated at $2.34 trillion. One trillion dollars ago, the last time the BTC economy moved at a $1.34 trillion market cap, it was May 28th, 2024. That was a trillion dollars added by saver-investors and users in just 13-and-a-half months. As the currency gathers pace to the peak of this multi-year bull run, it could pull that trick again in even less time. Wall Street is stoking this rally, diverting billions of dollars a week away from stocks and to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Leveraged derivatives and futures traders are also pouring on the rocket fuel. On the current come up, BTC’s market cap just eclipsed Google’s and the global market valuation for all above-ground silver. That’s a major milestone for Bitcoin, a powerful and useful engine, and a payments and savings platform like silver markets. But unlike silver, BTC can move around the world nearly as fast as lightning. Unlike Google, it is secured by the blockchain. 2. US Govt Now Accepts BTC For Home Loans The US government now officially accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as financial collateral for home loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “Previously,” reported USA Today, “mortgage applicants had to convert any Bitcoin holdings into U.S. dollars if they wanted their crypto to count.” But now BTC holders can keep their crypto and list it as an asset on federal mortgage applications. Earlier, on 7/6, Benzinga and Yahoo Finance highlighted a question about Bitcoin’s use case that someone asked on Reddit: “If only 5% of the population owns BTC, what is the use case? So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently ‘minted’ and only 4% of the population are holders… What good is a ‘currency’ that only 5% of the population owns???” The article noted the stakes for Bitcoin’s market valuation, calling the answer to the Redditor’s question “a fundamental tension that’s been brewing in the crypto space for years.” At the end of June, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency has now taken one of the most compelling use cases for Bitcoin in its history and made it real. 3. Corporations, Whales, and VCs Bullish Murano Global, the techie real estate lending platform with a hot new stock on the Nasdaq, just signed an equity funding agreement in July to buy $500 million worth of Bitcoin. So the company is selling its own stock to buy as much as half a billion USD worth of BTC with the proceeds. Under this arrangement, investors give Murano a dollar in return for a dollar’s worth of their company’s stock. Murano turns around and uses that dollar to buy a dollar’s worth of Bitcoin. This supercharges the investor’s stake in the company with the promise of corporate finances hedged by Bitcoin from the risks of inflation and wasteful corporate spending. And that’s just an isolated example – you also have your Strategies, Metaplanets, and all other companies that are running this playbook to perfection during this cycle. 80,000 BTC From 2011 Make A Monster Splash The growing market of long-term corporate Bitcoin buyer-holders may have a willing seller in the mysterious “Sleeping Beauty” BTC addresses that have remained locked since 2011. In the first half of July, these 80,000 BTC moved for the first time in nearly a decade and a half. They may already be sold, or the owner may be getting them ready to scoop long-awaited profits in anticipation of a rally peak that this monster Bitcoin whale just can’t pass up at the moment. It’s not just Internet whales and corporate CFOs who are still outrageously bullish for the class-leading cryptocurrency. VCs are back to funding new blockchain startups in earnest. Bitcoin is back to raising venture capital at levels unseen since the last bull market peak in 2022.

2025-07-19T11:23:06,"Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme”","The post Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Gold advocate and long-time crypto critic Peter Schiff has taken aim at the U.S. government’s latest pro-crypto move, calling the newly signed GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act, and anti-CBDC bill a “legislative low point.” While the crypto community, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , cheered the passing of these bills as a historic win for digital assets, Schiff warned that they may actually weaken the U.S. dollar and boost what he calls a “decentralized Ponzi scheme” in Bitcoin. The main purpose of the ""landmark"" crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Crypto Bills Trigger Market Pullback Rather than rallying on the news, crypto prices dipped. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2%, while top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) pulled back after recent gains. Schiff believes this proves the legislation is more about hype than substance. “The industry is using these bills to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices,” he said, warning that the bills are fueling short-term gains at the cost of long-term stability. Schiff: Stablecoins Won’t Save the Dollar The GENIUS Act supports dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a move praised by industry leaders like Rum’s Chris Pavlovski and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , who claim it will strengthen the dollar’s global position. But Schiff strongly disagrees. “Stablecoins are only as strong as the U.S. dollar itself,” he argued, calling the idea “nonsense” and warning that this supposed stability will fade as the dollar continues to weaken. He remains firm in his belief that gold, not Bitcoin or stablecoins, is the real store of value. Trump’s Crypto Push: Bold or Risky? Alongside the new bills, Trump is also pushing for an executive order to allow 401(k) retirement investments in Bitcoin and crypto. Schiff sees this as a dangerous move that could speed up the dollar’s decline. “Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner – Bitcoin will crash too,” he said. How Will This Move Shape Up? Schiff’s warnings raise serious questions about where the U.S. is headed with its new pro-crypto stance. While many see these bills as a step forward, critics like Schiff argue they may backfire, risking more harm to the economy than help. As crypto regulation takes shape, the debate is far from over: are these bills laying the groundwork for a digital future or opening the door to financial trouble .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-19T11:14:02,"21Shares seeks SEC approval for two new crypto ETFs, including one without Bitcoin","21Shares has partnered with commodity-focused asset manager Teucrium to file two new cryptocurrency index ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The proposed funds, 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF and 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF, will be structured according to the Investment Company Act of 1940, or as recent Solana staking ETFs did. FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF will aim to replicate a market-cap-weighted basket of the top 10 digital assets in the world. This second non-Bitcoin tracking product will use a different FTSE Russell index made of leading non-Bitcoin tokens. They both seek to offer investors clear and broad access to digital assets in familiar ETF structures. Kristen Mierzwa, Head of Digital Assets at FTSE Russell, pointed to the construction of the indices, which were crafted to provide strategic allocation differentials grounded on a strong digital asset pricing architecture. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, noted the unique positioning of these funds, pointing out that the ETF indicates the increased investor demand in coverage beyond BTC. Tokenization strategy aligns with growing institutional demand Federico Brokate, Head of U.S. Business at 21Shares , pointed out that interest in diversified crypto exposure, and particularly regulatory-compliant vehicles, remains strong among investors. The firm’s use of the ’40 Act framework signals a shift toward integrating crypto with traditional financial structures, offering tax and legal familiarity to U.S. investors. “Investors are increasingly looking for diversified and easy-to-access ways to participate in the long-term growth of digital assets, and 21Shares aims to provide ETF structures to satisfy this demand, subject to regulatory approval.” ~ Federico Brokate 21Shares is also advancing efforts in crypto tokenization, where legislative advances in the U.S. have led to regulatory clarity. The recently signed GENIUS Act gives more clarity regarding stablecoins and digital asset-backed instruments. This compliance environment makes structured crypto-based ETFs more feasible, according to industry participants. The collaboration with Teucrium also aligns with the 21Shares strategy on uniting traditional finance with digital assets. Teucrium has experience issuing commodity and futures-based ETFs under compliant structures, which could expedite SEC inspection of the crypto index products. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs draw record institutional inflows Institutional momentum has been observed in the ETF market. According to SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw $799.4 million in net buyers on July 16. The streak of positive flows over ten days pushed the total cumulative inflows to above $53.8 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded nearly $764 million in new inflows, reaching an asset management rate of $86.7 billion. In the meantime, ETFs on Ethereum had a record-breaking demand. On the same day, U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw a new single-day record of net inflows, at $726.7 million. BlackRock ETHA and Grayscale ETHE have shown a daily growth of over 11%. The increasing popularity of spot crypto ETFs and the increasing regulatory framework, with regulatory bills such as the GENIUS Act, portend a larger shift toward institutional adoption.

2025-07-19T11:10:25,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Settles Around $118,000, Is Another July All-Time High Possible?","Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading below the $120,000 mark. Analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally is only taking a breather, and have not ruled out another bull run before the end of the month. BTC’s latest rally saw its price surge past $123,000, settling an all-time high of $123,091 before losing momentum as selling pressure returned, thanks to traders locking in their profits. Bitcoin Dominance Drops As Altcoins Rise Bitcoin (BTC) dominance fell as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) dominance rose sharply over the past week. However, analysts are unsure if the decline will translate into a sustained increase for altcoins. According to Adrian Fritz, head of research at Switzerland-based asset manager 21Shares, while altcoins are surging, there needs to be a trend reversal for the so-called “altcoin season” to begin. Bitcoin dominance stood at $2.3 trillion or 61% of the total market, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, Ethereum dominance jumped 23% and XRP dominance rose 23% as the latter hit a record high. Previous market cycles have seen altcoins surge after Bitcoin’s price has peaked, suggesting that traders pivot to other assets as the bull market continues. However, market dynamics have changed in recent years with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing more investors access to the flagship cryptocurrency. Fritz added, “It’s hard to imagine that Bitcoin’s dominance drops to levels that we've seen in previous bull markets. Over the last year, the spotlight has definitely been on Bitcoin.” Satoshi-Era Whale Could Secure Unprecedented Profits A Satoshi-era whale who shifted the remaining 40,912 Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital could be on the verge of securing unprecedented profits after over a decade of holding the asset. The whale made an initial transfer of 40,009 Bitcoin on Tuesday, before transferring the remaining, worth nearly $5 billion. Blockchain on-chain data service Onchain Lens was the first to notice the transfer. The latest transfer means the whale has moved all his Bitcoin holdings, worth $9.6 billion, to Galaxy Digital. The whale has already transferred 6,000 Bitcoin to Binance and Bybit, according to blockchain intelligence platform Nansen. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platforms, stated that no one could be sure what the whale’s motivations are for moving his holdings. Stadelmann speculated that the whale may have decided it was a good time to secure “jaw-dropping profits.” “The whale may simply want stability for their family or plan to start a new venture. Maybe they are going to fund off-grid projects that align with the self-reliance vision of Bitcoin.” However, Stadelmann also suggested that the whale could have mixed feelings about liquidating their holdings after Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the $120,000 mark, facing repeated rejections since losing the level after Monday’s rally. Analysts believe BTC could enter a brief consolidation phase after recent record highs. However, they have not ruled out another rally before the end of the month. According to Michael Harvey, Galaxy Digital’s head of franchise trading, BTC could trend higher towards the end of 2025. “Consolidation around current prices is my base case given the large rally and new ATH. I do expect BTC to trend higher into the year-end, but pausing here for air would be realistic. I think the best case BTC price into month end is a continued slow melt-up.” Harvey stated that if bulls lose momentum and bearish sentiment takes over, BTC could drop back below $110,000. “Bear case is a risk-off move driven by profit taking and/or equity market weakness, which I believe could see BTC retrace 5-10%.” BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 0.88% to $108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 2.12% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, increasing 3.51% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,134. The price continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% and settling at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $116,616. The price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Source: TradingView BTC aced past $123,000 on Monday, surging to a new all-time high of $123,091. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. The price fell to an intraday low of $115,701 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level and settled at $117,682, a drop of nearly 2%. BTC rose 0.82% on Wednesday 0.82% and settled at $118,641. The price reached an intraday high of $120,812 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $119,101.

2025-07-19T11:03:06,"Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules","The post Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is making his frustration clear. In a direct post on X , he called out five U.S. states for pushing forward with legal action against crypto staking, even after Congress passed a bill that says staking-as-a-service is not a security. “I gotta call out one critical provision of CLARITY Act that hasn’t received the attention it is due: staking-as-a-service is confirmed as a non-security and rule-making is ordered,” Grewal wrote. The law he’s referring to is the CLARITY Act , which passed the House last month with strong bipartisan support. It clearly states that staking services offered by crypto platforms should not be treated as securities, which is a big deal for the industry. Five States Under Fire Despite that clarity, California, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland, and Wisconsin are still pursuing claims against Coinbase over its staking services. Grewal says these actions directly ignore the law and what’s more, he points out that 32 Democratic lawmakers from those same states actually voted for the CLARITY Act. That contradiction is what’s fueling frustration. According to Grewal, these state regulators are acting as if the bill never passed 5 states (CA, NJ, WA, MD, and WI) that refuse to acknowledge this insist on pursuing baseless claims against us and these services. But 32 Congressional Democrats from these states alone voted for this bill, underscoring that the state agencies pursuing these cases are deeply at… pic.twitter.com/tF019kfpr9 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) July 19, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme” , This Patchwork Approach Can’t Continue The bigger issue, Grewal explains, is the ongoing lack of coordination between state and federal regulators. While Congress is pushing forward with clearer crypto rules, some states are still using outdated or unclear laws to take enforcement action. “It’s time to end this patchwork of state regulation by enforcement and align with Congress on clear, bipartisan crypto rules,” Grewal said , adding that he hopes the Senate will move quickly to finish what the House started. Coinbase Steps Up Lobbying This statement comes as Coinbase intensifies its efforts in Washington. The exchange recently brought in David Plouffe, a former adviser to Kamala Harris and Barack Obama, to join its advisory board. The goal: influence key lawmakers and push for fair crypto regulation. Coinbase has long called for clear rules. With the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts gaining momentum, the platform is now urging lawmakers to finish the job, especially when it comes to staking. What’s Next for Staking? The CLARITY Act gives staking services some long-awaited relief. But until the Senate acts, and until state regulators get on the same page, the legal battles may continue. What Grewal wants for now is that regulators respect what Congress has already decided. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
