2025-07-19T15:45:10,"Bitcoin Flashing ‚ÄòVery Bullish Signal‚Äô Right Now, According to Analyst Kevin Svenson ‚Äì Here‚Äôs His Target","Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying one indicator is signaling major momentum for Bitcoin ( BTC ). Svenson tells his 83,500 YouTube subscribers that the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to determine overbought or oversold conditions, is flashing a signal on the daily time frame that has previously preceded massive rallies such as in October of 2023, February of 2024 and November of 2024. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI is attempting to bounce off of the overbought zone. Which, in my book, when you break out and you enter overbought, that is oftentimes can be a very bullish signal. Contrary to what most people would assume, they think that overbought is always bad.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/X The RSI indicator is calibrated from zero to 100, with readings of zero to 30 indicating oversold conditions and readings of above 70 indicating overbought conditions. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could go up by nearly 20% from the current level in a few months to hit the cycle peak. ‚ÄúBitcoin right now breaking above this resistance ($112,000) into the overbought zone. It usually signals major momentum‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm aiming for something around $142,000 for this run. You know, that‚Äôs a multi-month target. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to happen necessarily in a month. I think that‚Äôll happen anywhere from, you know, a couple months to around October of this year‚Ä¶ The Bitcoin halving cycle profit shows that 80 weeks after the halving is the usual start of the bear market, which in this cycle is going to be landing us around end of October.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading at $118,994 at time of writing.

2025-07-19T15:25:26,"Ethereum at $30K? Tom Lee Says Corporate Treasuries Could Make It Happen","Tom Lee is making bold calls again‚Äîthis time, putting Ethereum in the spotlight. He says if companies follow MicroStrategy‚Äôs game plan and use their balance sheets to buy ETH with stock and debt, a $30,000 Ethereum isn't just a dream‚Äîit‚Äôs a math equation. BitMine, SharpLink, and Bit Digital have already scooped up over 682,000 ETH , and they‚Äôre not done. BitMine alone wants to control 5% of Ethereum‚Äôs entire supply. In just a week, they reportedly bought more ETH than MicroStrategy did in its first Bitcoin round back in 2020. SharpLink, backed by ETH co-founder Joseph Lubin, boosted its SEC filing from $1B to $6B‚Äîclearly aiming to keep buying. Bit Digital sold stock and BTC to grab over 100,000 ETH. Lee‚Äôs point? MicroStrategy‚Äôs massive stock run‚Äî35x since 2020‚Äîwasn‚Äôt just about Bitcoin going up. Only about a third of it came from BTC‚Äôs rise. The rest? Their financial strategy. By issuing shares and taking on debt, they accelerated their BTC buys‚Äîand investors rewarded that with a skyrocketing stock price. Lee thinks Ethereum is even better suited for this playbook. Why? Because ETH‚Äôs volatility can actually help reduce borrowing costs. Plus, companies can use convertible notes and preferred shares to buy ETH without diluting shareholders too much. This creates what Lee calls a ""reflexive loop"": higher ETH buys push up the stock price, which lets companies raise more cash, to buy even more ETH , and so on. That speeds up price discovery‚Äîand compresses time. Unlike MicroStrategy, which took years, these ETH-heavy firms are moving billions in just weeks. ETH sits around $3,600 today. If Lee‚Äôs right, $30K might not be crazy‚Äîit might just be good math.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ethereum-at-30k-tom-lee-says-corporate-treasuries-could-make-it-happen,"ETH|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION","",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T15:11:00,"Bitcoin Podcaster Peter McCormack Pledges to Fight Crime in Bedford Like a Real-Life Batman","Peter McCormack, well-known Bitcoin podcaster and owner of Real Bedford FC, has announced a bold plan to tackle rising crime in Bedford, UK, stepping into a role some liken to a real-life Batman. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack is funding private security patrols in Bedford to address rising crime. McCormack cites police inaction and growing issues like harassment and shoplifting harming local businesses. Legal experts warn that vigilantism is illegal in the UK. Frustrated by what he calls the police‚Äôs failure to protect the community, McCormack is personally funding a pilot initiative deploying ten security guards to patrol the town center every Saturday. In a post on X , McCormack said, ‚ÄúIf the police won‚Äôt keep the town safe for our women and children, I will.‚Äù Rising Crime in Bedford Sparks Business Closures McCormack said his concerns center on a surge in crime, including aggressive begging, shoplifting, and harassment, which he says have driven shoppers away, forced stores to close, and left families feeling unsafe. The Bedford-based entrepreneur and football club owner claims he issued a warning to local police before launching his plan, criticizing them for not addressing these issues. Bedford, a town of around 185,800 residents located less than two hours from London, has seen McCormack become a vocal advocate for community safety. Alongside his business ventures, he runs Real Bedford FC, a football club famously dubbed the ‚ÄúBitcoin soccer team,‚Äù backed by investments from Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. McCormack has engaged local residents by surveying them about crime and has called for community meetings to build support for his security project. Announcing my private security pilot for Bedford Town Centre ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Starting this August, I‚Äôm personally funding a pilot project to provide private security in Bedford. Every Saturday, 10 guards will patrol the town centre and oversee safe parking at Lurke‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Peter McCormack (@PeterMcCormack) July 18, 2025 Despite the initiative‚Äôs ambition, legal questions remain around how these private security personnel will operate in public spaces. Vigilantism is illegal in the UK, and experts from JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors caution that such efforts must stay within legal boundaries. It is suggested that the guards may function more as informants, gathering video evidence to assist police investigations, similar to the growing trend of traffic vigilantes in the country. While the concept of privately funded security patrols might seem unconventional, it reflects a broader trend in areas facing police shortages. Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the San Francisco Police Department noted earlier this year that private security increasingly fills gaps left by understaffed law enforcement agencies. However, Altorfer emphasized the importance of clear collaboration between private security firms and public police to ensure accountability and effectiveness. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnappings. The rise in inquiries came after a spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnapping attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

2025-07-19T15:00:00,"State of Crypto: The Industry's No Good, Very Bad Wait Actually Excellent Week","The ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,"" otherwise known as the GENIUS Act, is now the law of the land, after President Donald Trump signed the first major U.S. legislation following a week-long process to pass it and two other bills in the House of Representatives. You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Stable tokens The narrative On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto bill into law. This is the first time a major cryptocurrency bill has become law, and it likely is not the last. Why it matters For the first time, a major cryptocurrency bill has become law in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, which sets out to create a regulatory framework governing stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset like the U.S. dollar, kickstarts a process that will see the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators become far more involved in the crypto sector. Breaking it down There was a bit of a false start. The House Rules Committee met Monday evening to debate the bills with key members of the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees ahead of a procedural vote, which the House held Tuesday. That procedural vote was expected to sail through, albeit on party-line votes. It did not. Members of the House Freedom Caucus voted against the procedural motion to open debate and threw a wrench into the House's ""Crypto Week."" Later that evening, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that 11 of the holdouts had agreed to vote for the motion and the House reconvened on Wednesday to first vote to hold a redo on the other vote (this one passed mostly along party lines) and then to actually redo the other vote. Many of the 11 holdouts continued to hold out. Trump, in remarks made before signing the GENIUS Act on Friday, joked about this: ""I am so tired of making phone calls at 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning."" Still, after a record-breaking 9+ hour vote, the lawmakers did finally vote in favor of the move to debate, clearing the way to a final vote for the three bills on Thursday. Despite these hiccups, Congressman Bryan Steil noted that Crypto Week largely played out as planned, with three bills getting passed and one heading to the president's desk. ""In the House, it feels like in the home stretch with the narrow majority, there's final negotiations, final discussions,"" he said on CoinDesk TV Thursday ahead of the vote. ""But the good news is the play call that was made at the start of the week is the play call we're executing today, which is passing GENIUS, putting that on the president's desk for his signature into law."" Moreover, while industry participants anticipated that maybe 30 or so Democrats would vote for the bills, the actual numbers dramatically surpassed this ‚Äî 78 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in voting for Clarity and 102 Democrats/206 Republicans voted for GENIUS. For context, last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Clarity's predecessor, saw 78 Democrats and 208 Republicans vote in favor. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, speaking at a press conference after Thursday's votes, was positively giddy at successfully shepherding the bills through in just a matter of months: ""I knew that my target was to beat FIT21 and I made a bet with myself ‚Äî and I won."" Neither Clarity nor GENIUS are done yet. The next steps for GENIUS belong to the federal regulators tasked with implementing its provisions. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and others will now have to launch the rulemaking process to develop the actual regulations asked for in the law. Clarity's next steps are murkier. The Senate is clearly working on its own bill, at least at the moment ‚Äî senators have introduced principles and are holding hearings. These actions suggest the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees may do their own thing, rather than adopt Clarity as it is. Hill, in Thursday's press conference, made it clear he hoped the Senate would take Clarity up. And House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn GT Thompson said on CoinDesk TV on Thursday morning that he had been working with his Senate counterparts as it launched its process. Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott previously set a Sept. 30 deadline for moving the Senate's market structure bill, which will govern a far broader swath of the industry.

Tornado Cash Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's criminal trial kicked off this week, with jury selection taking a day and a half and the overall trial now expected to run approximately three weeks. Storm was arrested in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. So far prosecutors have only just begun making their case, beginning with a set of witnesses who say they were victims of Tornado Cash. Prosecutors will be making their case to a largely non-technical jury. Just one member works as an IT manager, while another works at Palantir. The rest have a range of jobs and educational backgrounds. There's also ongoing motions efforts separate from the trial itself, with defense attorneys moving to try and kick out some of the evidence prosecutors have suggested they'll introduce.
