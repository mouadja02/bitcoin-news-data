2025-07-19T20:30:49,"XRP Analyst Sees Clear Path Beyond $100 And Toward $1,000","A popular XRP proponent recently projected a clear path for XRP to reach $1,000. Particularly, crypto commentator BarriC laid out a multi-stage price forecast that places the XRP price on a trajectory toward $1,000. The statement, posted on the social media platform X, follows XRP‚Äôs recent surge to a new all-time high for the first time since 2018. Expert Predicts Multi-Stage XRP Price Explosion XRP has been on an interesting price run since the beginning of the month, which kicked off when it broke out of its long-term consolidation below $2.2 on July 5. This was followed by a string of inflows alongside the rest of the crypto market as Bitcoin pushed to new price territories above $120,000. Related Reading: XRP To $13 in 40 Days? Analyst Predicts Explosive Final Rally However, although Bitcoin peaked at $122,800 on July 14 and has since entered a corrective phase below $120,000, the altcoin has managed to keep up its gains in the days after July 14. This detachment from Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum started after the SEC‚Äôs approval of ProShares‚Äô XRP ETFs, which has contributed to the crypto asset‚Äôs push to a new all-time high of $3.65 in the past 24 hours and its market cap breaking the $200 billion threshold. Interestingly, XRP‚Äôs price is now trading in unknown territory, and the next price target for bulls is $4. BarriC‚Äôs post begins with a near-term target of $4 for XRP, which many bullish analysts have been watching closely for weeks. From there, BarriC anticipates a rapid expansion into double digits, forecasting a range between $10 and $20. Although the projection did not come with a technical analysis of XRP‚Äôs price action, the outlook that truly captures attention is his final projection: a ‚Äúclear path‚Äù that leads XRP beyond the $100 mark and ultimately to a $1,000 valuation. $1,000 XRP: Path Or Pipe Dream? The notion of XRP reaching $1,000 has been discussed in the past but remains a controversial subject. To achieve a price point in the triple digits, its market capitalization would need to exceed $50 trillion, more than double the value of the most valuable public companies in the world combined. Central to BarriC‚Äôs prediction of a $1,000 XRP price is based on the belief that its utility in cross-border payments and banking infrastructure will drive its long-term value. A $1,000 XRP becomes realistic only when mass institutional adoption from banks turns transactional demand into structural demand.

On the other hand, price targets like $10 and $100 in the coming years are still realistic based on the current fundamentals of the altcoin and the XRP Ledger. The first step is a break above $4, which can only be possible if XRP manages to secure $3 as its new base price going forward. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.44, up by 22% in the past seven days.

2025-07-19T20:30:25,"IMF Bombshell: El Salvador Didn‚Äôt Buy Bitcoin In 2025 After All","A new report has shaken up El‚ÄØSalvador‚Äôs bold Bitcoin story. All year long, President Nayib Bukele and the National Bitcoin Office promised they were buying one BTC every day. Public trackers even showed holdings climbing past 6,102 BTC. Yet the IMF‚Äôs July‚ÄØ15 Article‚ÄØIV consultation says there were no new purchases since the $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility was approved in December‚ÄØ2024. Internal Wallet Moves Created Illusion Of Buying According to the IMF report, the rise in public‚Äësector Bitcoin didn‚Äôt come from fresh spending. Instead, government‚Äëowned wallets moved coins around. Those transfers made balances pop up on public dashboards. But those were just internal shifts. They didn‚Äôt draw on taxpayer money or involve the market. Small ups and downs in the Chivo e‚Äëwallet also came from internal corrections, not new deposits. Turns out the IMF did in fact make El Salvador stop Bitcoin purchases in order to get a fiat loan. Footnote #9 states they have just been making it appear as if they have been continuing to buy but in fact have just been consolidating multi government wallets. Source :‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/46AFU1oi08 ‚Äî Magoo PhD (@HodlMagoo) July 17, 2025 Pressure On Bitcoin Legal Tender Reversal Back in 2021, El‚ÄØSalvador grabbed headlines by making Bitcoin legal tender. That move set off cheers and warnings around the world. Reports show the country flipped that decision in January‚ÄØ2025 under pressure from international lenders. They stripped Bitcoin of its legal‚Äëtender status and agreed to stop using public funds for more coins. The IMF now confirms those promises held true. Deadline Looms For Chivo E‚ÄëWallet Exit Based on reports, the government must end public‚Äësector involvement in the Chivo system by July‚ÄØ31,‚ÄØ2025. That date is just around the corner. El‚ÄØSalvador has also promised to unwind Fidebitcoin, the public Bitcoin trust it set up. Both steps aim to boost fiscal transparency and keep the Extended Fund Facility on track. Analysts Eye Trust And Transparency Questions Some experts say the big takeaway is about trust. Shuffling coins between wallets while claiming new buys can hurt the government‚Äôs credibility. Citizens and investors could start to wonder what else might be spun into a story. Even if no fresh money changed hands, the mismatch between claims and reality has put a spotlight on how data gets shared. The IMF gave credit for meeting its program targets. Yet the coming weeks will show if the government follows through on all its commitments. Clearing out Chivo and dissolving Fidebitcoin are major moves. If El‚ÄØSalvador sticks to the plan, it could reset its narrative. If not, skeptics will find new reasons to doubt every future Bitcoin announcement.

In an earnings call for the second quarter of 2025, Dimon said that the fintech-fee decision was made to protect its customers when asked about the new policy. ‚ÄúSo, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they ‚Äì do they actually know what‚Äôs being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn‚Äôt be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be re-marketed or resold to third parties. And so, we‚Äôre kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system‚Äôs protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that‚Äôs the main part. It‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù The fintech companies use the information to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money. JPMorgan is reportedly poised to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the service. Alex Rampell, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and co-founder of the buy now, pay later business Affirm, is slamming JPMorgan‚Äôs move, warning it will make it more difficult to move money into crypto. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about a new revenue stream. It‚Äôs about strangling competition. And if they get away with this, every bank will follow‚Ä¶ If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a Coinbase or Robinhood account ‚Äì maybe fewer people will do it.‚Äù Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of crypto platform Kraken, is criticizing JPMorgan for ‚Äúasserting ownership over data that is generated by users but stored inside infrastructure the bank controls.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should not be optimizing for defensibility through restriction. We should be leveraging our position and profitability to build better access, more open architecture and more composable systems. That means investing in protocols, not just platforms.
