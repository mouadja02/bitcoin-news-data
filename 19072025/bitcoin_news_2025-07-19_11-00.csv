2025-07-19T08:30:29,"Top 5 Cloud Mining Sites in 2025: Best Crypto Platforms for Profitable Mining","Cloud mining remains an attractive passive income option for crypto investors in 2025, especially considering the high entry barriers to solo mining. Selecting the right platform is crucial to maximizing ROI, minimizing risk, and ensuring sustainable profitability. In this detailed guide, we review the top cloud mining services available this year. Quick Overview: Best Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025 BeMine — Optimal choice with diverse features, high transparency Binance Cloud Mining — Ideal for existing Binance ecosystem users Bitdeer — Suitable for large-scale investors BitFuFu — Trusted partner with Bitmain-backed reliability Hashing24 — Established platform with straightforward terms 1. BeMine Overview: Founded: 2018 Minimum investment: ~$160 Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: ⭐️3.8 (over 400 reviews) BeMine tops the ranking by combining versatile functionality with genuine transparency. Unlike typical hash-rate rental services, BeMine allows you to fully or fractionally own real ASIC miners located in professional data centers, enabling accurate ROI projections and realistic profitability. Pros: Trial Mining: Offers a 3-day free trial with Antminer S21 Hydro and up to 8 additional trial days upon deposit, allowing users to test the platform and earn real BTC to reduce their initial investment. Altcoin Mining: Supports mining various altcoins, with automatic conversion to BTC. DOGE mining: Mined on separate devices with its own balance. AI Mining: Automatically optimizes mining for maximum profitability (up to 30% higher returns). User-Friendly Platform: Simple, intuitive interface with helpful built-in mining income calculators. Stable and Low Electricity Costs (~$0.06/kWh): Among the best fixed rates in the market. Active User Rewards: Engaging bonuses, quizzes, and promotional events. PAWA Token: Additional opportunities via the platform’s native token. Responsive Support: Prompt and helpful customer service available. Cons: Requires understanding of mining dynamics for optimal results. Real hardware means users must consider network difficulty, BTC price volatility, and hardware efficiency. BeMine stands out by providing real ASIC access, robust tools for profitability optimization, and a clear commitment to transparency. 2. Binance Cloud Mining Overview: Founded: 2017 Minimum investment: from 1 TH/s ≈ $200 (depends on hashrate packages) Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: ⭐️1.6/5 Binance offers cloud mining primarily for users already integrated into its ecosystem. Easy integration with Binance’s other services provides convenience but limited transparency regarding actual hardware and mining costs. Pros: Trusted brand with extensive crypto services Straightforward investment process Cons: Always sold out — mining power rarely available Lower user ratings reflect occasional support and transparency issues Limited detailed mining analytics Binance is suitable for users who prefer brand familiarity despite mixed user reviews. 3. Bitdeer Overview: Founded: 2013 Minimum investment: ~$200+ Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: ⭐️2.0/5 Bitdeer is suitable for large investors, offering comprehensive mining solutions with a high degree of scalability. However, high minimum investments make it less accessible for small investors. Pros: Good selection of reputable mining hardware Well-structured investment options Cons: Limited visibility into real-time miner stats and fee structure Occasional customer service delays A lot of KYC required — not ideal for casual users Bitdeer appeals to those who value hardware reliability but may need to overlook customer service gaps. 4. BitFuFu Overview: Founded: 2020 Minimum investment: ~$300 Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: ⭐️2.1/5 BitFuFu, backed by mining giant Bitmain, offers reliability and security. However, limited transparency in cost structures and relatively higher entry points restrict wider accessibility. Pros: Low entry point Good flexibility in plan choices Cons: Newer platform with limited historical data Mixed transparency reviews BitFuFu suits beginners and budget-conscious miners but requires cautious approach due to limited platform history. 5. Hashing24 Overview: Founded: 2016 Minimum investment: ~$5 (low GH/s plans) Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: Unavailable (company flagged for displaying misleading content) Hashing24 is among the oldest cloud mining services, known for transparent and straightforward contracts. Yet, recent Trustpilot warnings and limited additional features may raise concerns for new investors. Pros: Low initial investment Established presence in market Cons: Trustpilot warning indicates transparency issues Limited detailed information publicly available Hashing24 could appeal to those looking for minimal investments, but transparency concerns make it risky. What is Cloud Mining and How Does It Work? Cloud mining allows investors to rent or own shares of mining hardware hosted remotely in specialized data centers. Investors earn a portion of the mined cryptocurrencies without dealing with equipment management, noise, heat, and other technical challenges associated with direct mining.

2025-07-19T08:30:06,"Ethereum Futures Flip Bitcoin: Volume 50% Higher Than BTC’s","Data shows the Ethereum futures volume has flipped that of Bitcoin, a sign that strong speculative interest is flooding into the asset. Ethereum Futures Volume Has Shot Up Alongside Price Rally According to data from the analytics firm Glassnode , Ethereum has managed to surpass Bitcoin in terms of futures trading volume again. The trading volume here naturally refers to the amount of trading that a given asset saw on the different centralized exchanges during the past day. In the context of the current topic, the volume associated with the futures market specifically is of interest. Below is a table that shows how this metric compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum at the time of Glassnode’s post. As is visible, Bitcoin registered a futures trading volume of $67.5 billion, notably lower than the $104.2 billion figure witnessed by Ethereum. This isn’t something that ordinarily happens, as the number one cryptocurrency usually observes more speculative demand than ETH or the altcoins. In the same table, data of a few other futures-related indicators is also shown. The BTC Open Interest , a metric that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions currently open on all derivatives platforms, sat at $64.2 billion at the time of the post. The same indicator for ETH was at $32.2 billion, indicating that the original digital asset was still far ahead in terms of total market positioning. That said, the 24-hour change in the metric stood at a positive 6.1% for Ethereum, while Bitcoin saw a drop of 1.4% The fresh demand for ETH has come as its price has broken away from the market, accompanied by a strong wave of inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Interestingly, while all this attention came toward the cryptocurrency, its average Funding Rate still didn’t turn too positive. The Funding Rate is an indicator that keeps track of the amount of periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging between each other. When this metric is green, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies the presence of a bullish mentality among the traders. From the table, it’s apparent that the Funding Rate stood at 0.0096% for Ethereum even after the spike in futures trading volume. This was less than Bitcoin’s value of 0.01%. Thus, while fresh positioning is occurring for ETH, it seems the investors are still not getting too optimistic. “This setup leans bullish: strong speculative interest, rising OI, and no signs of overheating yet,” notes the analytics firm. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, up almost 21% in the last week.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-futures-bitcoin-volume-50-higher-btcs/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Ethereum|bitcoin|Bitcoin Futures Volume|btc|ETH|Ethereum futures|Ethereum Futures Volume|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T08:30:06,"Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Now For Sale: Galaxy Digital Sends 1,500 BTC To Binance","Bitcoin is currently consolidating between $115,000 and its all-time high of $123,000, forming a tight range that has kept both bulls and bears on edge. Despite the recent surge, price action has slowed, and while bulls are holding strong above key levels, market participants are growing cautious about the potential for a correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Top 30 Global Assets With $416B Market Cap – What’s Next? Adding to the uncertainty is the resurfacing of a Satoshi-era whale. Top analyst Darkfost has been tracking this long-dormant wallet, which recently transferred 80,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital, a major player in digital assets and AI infrastructure. The move immediately triggered speculation across the crypto space, as such large transfers are often associated with upcoming sales. The timing of this transfer is crucial. It coincides with increased exchange inflows and rising discussions of institutional profit-taking. With the market already in a delicate position, the possibility that a portion of this massive BTC stack could be sold has analysts and investors bracing for elevated volatility. Whale Starts Selling: 1,500 BTC Sent To Binance Darkfost has confirmed that Galaxy Digital has just moved 1,500 BTC to a Binance deposit address. These coins were previously part of the massive 80,000 BTC linked to a Satoshi-era whale who recently reactivated their wallet. The latest transfer suggests that a portion of this historic stash is officially up for sale. At current prices, the 1,500 BTC represents around $180 million in market value. More importantly, it marks one of the fastest and most significant offloads ever recorded from a single wallet, with the total 80K BTC valued at roughly $9.54 billion. While they have only moved a small fraction to exchanges so far, the sale could signal larger intentions. Some view this transfer as a potential warning sign, especially given the current consolidation above $115K. In their view, such high-volume activity from a long-term holder might precede further profit-taking or even a broader correction. Others, however, see it as a smart and well-timed move from an investor who has held since Bitcoin’s earliest days and is finally realizing some gains. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates BTC Price Holds Tight Range After ATH Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,000, consolidating within a tight range between $115,730 and $123,230, as shown in the 12-hour chart. This comes after a strong breakout earlier this month that pushed BTC to a new all-time high of $123,230. Since then, price action has shown signs of cooling without a major pullback, suggesting bulls remain in control, but short-term momentum is slowing. The chart displays a healthy structure, with BTC trading well above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages, which are currently at $111,819, $108,563, and $102,963. This confirms strong trend support from long-term holders and momentum investors. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Key Technical Level – Can Momentum Sustain This Time? Volume has increased during the move higher, indicating conviction behind the breakout, but the last few candles show lower follow-through volume, consistent with a consolidation phase. If BTC holds above $115,730, the structure remains bullish and could lead to another breakout toward $130,000 and beyond. A break below this level, however, could open the door for a deeper retracement, with the $112K–$111K zone acting as key moving average support.

2025-07-19T08:28:09,"Crypto Markets Shed $100 Billion as Bitcoin Was Rejected at $120K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s price ascent to $120,000 came to a halt yesterday as the asset was rejected once again at that resistance and pushed south by a couple of grand. The altcoins, which were flying high yesterday, have seen even bigger price declines over the past 24 hours, with SUI leading the adverse trend. BTC Stopped at $120K Bitcoin had a spectacular start to the business week as its ascent that began last week culminated on Monday with a price surge to just over $123,000 . Thus, the cryptocurrency set a new all-time high after adding over $15,000 in the span of about five days. This ‘up only’ mode finally came to an end, and the asset went on an expected correction. It lost over seven grand in the following day or so, driven mainly by profit-taking and some uncertainty in the US after the worrying CPI data for June. Nevertheless, the bulls didn’t allow a further breakdown, and BTC started to recover the lost ground. By the end of the week, it challenged $120,000 and even went for $121,000 on a few occasions, but to no avail. The subsequent rejections pushed it south hard, and BTC slipped to $117,000 yesterday. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $118,000, but it’s still in the red on a daily scale. Its market cap has declined to $2.350 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is below 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Retrace Many altcoins posted impressive gains on Friday, but the situation has flipped since then. XRP, which skyrocketed to a new all-time high of over $3.6, has lost almost all gains and is down to just over the previous peak of $3.4. Ethereum was stopped at $3,700 and is now below $3,600. SUI has dumped the most from the larger-cap alts, followed by HYPE, XLM, ADA, SOL, and LINK. Dogecoin and ETC are the two exceptions from this cohort of altcoins. The total crypto market cap, which soared past $4 trillion yesterday, is down by $100 billion since the peak to $3.940 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction WLD Price Target July 2025 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $ 1.13507091 -2.44% Market Cap $ 1,978,442,686.5222 Circulating Supply 1,743,012,407.2276 Trading Volume $ 301,678,136.1212 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 WLD Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is poised for potential price action as it aims to retest the $1.60 level. If optimistic momentum builds, a further bullish movement could lead to $2.12 level. However, if WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it risks dropping back to as low as $0.57. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Worldcoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.57 1.60 2.12 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 In the first half of 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) continued its downward trend, particularly in Q1, where it hit an all-time low of $0.57. However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $1.15 mark by the third week of July. This optimism was due to broader crypto market optimism and their latest achievement that boosted its utility with its Orb device , which is available in 46 countries in July. As a result, an golden cross is witnessed in the WLD price, and it is aiming for the 200-day EMA. The past couple of months’ price action suggests a potential reawakening of bullish sentiment, as a slight upward trendline has given support to the WLD price, hinting at a possible short-term rise. At this juncture, many are curious: what could propel Worldcoin higher? History shows that social sentiment often plays a crucial role in the crypto space. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s value. If optimistic momentum builds in the coming sessions, WLD might retest the $1.60 level in July. A further bullish movement could lead to a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure, breaking above the $2.12 level. Clearing this threshold and confirming a ChoCh could signal a breakout from its bearish pattern, potentially allowing Worldcoin to retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, caution is warranted. If WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory this year, it could drop as low as $0.57, reminding investors of the volatility inherent in the crypto market.

2025-07-19T08:05:42,"Analyst Forecasts XRP Price If Bitcoin Hits $140,000","As Bitcoin approaches new all-time highs, crypto market analysts are paying increased attention to how alternative coins might respond. One researcher, known online as “Ripple Van Winkle,” recently expressed confidence that XRP could rise significantly if Bitcoin climbs to the $140,000 level. Van Winkle proposed that under such circumstances, XRP would not merely reach moderate price targets. Instead, he believes the token could exceed the $10 threshold and potentially climb to $14. This prediction aligns with broader market expectations that a shift in investor capital from Bitcoin to altcoins could create upward pressure on high-profile tokens such as XRP. Veteran Traders Also Back XRP’s Upside Van Winkle’s projection echoes recent comments made by market veteran ProfitMana, who included XRP among his top investment picks for the ongoing bull cycle. According to Mana, XRP has the potential to deliver returns between five and seven times its current value. He also suggested that the token’s price could peak at around $21 during this market cycle. If BTC tags $140K, XRP doesn’t just go to $7. It blows through $10 — maybe even $14. The XRP/BTC pair is the ultimate alpha signal. Rotation is coming. Be early or be exit liquidity. $XRP — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 17, 2025 These forecasts come at a time when Bitcoin, which briefly touched $120,000 earlier in the day, is now trading slightly lower at $117,400 . Its market dominance has declined by approximately 4.6% over the past week, signaling a potential redistribution of capital toward altcoins. During the same period, XRP has gained traction, with its market dominance increasing by 26%, reflecting renewed interest from investors. At a hypothetical price of $14, XRP’s market capitalization would stand near $825 billion. This would place the token in close competition with Ethereum in terms of total market value, significantly raising its profile in the crypto sector. XRP/BTC Pair as a Key Indicator A central element in Van Winkle’s forecast is the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he referred to as an essential metric for evaluating XRP’s breakout potential. Although he did not offer an in-depth analysis, other experts have provided technical context for this pairing. Earlier this month, analyst CrediBULL observed that the pair had approached a critical resistance level of 0.00002162 BTC for the fifth time in one month, after being rejected four times previously. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This resistance zone is aligned with a key Fibonacci retracement level, making it a strong technical barrier. A breakout above this level, which did occur, paved the way for further gains. As of the latest data, the pair is trading at 0.00003051 BTC. If the breakout holds, it may serve as further confirmation of the altcoin rally narrative. Historically, such breakouts in the XRP/BTC pair have been followed by sustained upward movements in XRP’s value, particularly during periods of waning Bitcoin dominance. Market Timing and Strategic Positioning Van Winkle emphasized the importance of early positioning for investors looking to benefit from a potential XRP rally. He advised market participants not to delay entry, cautioning that waiting too long could lead to missed opportunities or disadvantageous entry points. His message was clear: those who wait for broader market consensus might find themselves entering at the top, with limited room for gains. This view was also shared by software developer Vincent Van Code, who stated that the opportunity to buy XRP at ideal levels may already be gone. With Bitcoin showing signs of maturity in its current cycle and altcoins gaining momentum, many analysts believe the conditions are in place for a major shift in market leadership. XRP, supported by strong technical indicators and renewed investor interest, may be among the primary beneficiaries of that transition.
