2025-07-19T17:43:50,"The IMF says El Salvador lied about its BTC purchases","In a recent report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that El Salvador has not purchased any Bitcoin since December of last year. The Central American country‚Äôs Bitcoin Office has published regular updates on X, claiming that El Salvador is purchasing Bitcoin regularly. However, the IMF stated that El Salvador was merely moving BTC between government wallets. The IMF says El Salvador lied about its BTC purchases The IMF report is the first review of the 40-month, $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with El Salvador. In the report, the IMF stated that ‚Äúthe overall stock of Bitcoin held by the public sector has remained unchanged since program approval.‚Äù This statement debunks El Salvador‚Äôs claims of purchasing 1 BTC every single day. The IMF explained that the perceived increase in El Salvador‚Äôs public Bitcoin reserves was due to internal transfers and wallet consolidations among government-controlled wallets. More specifically, the BTC movements occurred between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund and the Chivo e‚Äëwallet. The IMF report included a footnote that says, ‚ÄúIncreases in Bitcoin holdings in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund reflect the consolidation of Bitcoin across various government‚Äëowned wallets.‚Äù The report, however, noted minor fluctuations in Chivo wallet balances due to client deposit activity. These were not the result of new public BTC purchases. As part of its $1.4‚ÄØbillion Extended Fund Facility agreement, the IMF explicitly required El‚ÄØSalvador to halt new Bitcoin purchases. Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, took to X on March 4 and said , ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not stopping. If it didn‚Äôt stop when the world ostracized us and most ‚Äòbitcoiners‚Äô abandoned us, it won‚Äôt stop now, and it won‚Äôt stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining.‚Äù The rhetoric of the Salvadoran government is mostly showmanship, but its actions align with the IMF‚Äôs demands. At the moment, the country‚Äôs Bitcoin Office website claims that the fund holds 6,242.18 BTC and an increase of 30 BTC in the last 30 days. Bitcoin‚ÄØCity stalled, other projects halted At the end of 2021, Nayib Bukele announced his plan to build a Bitcoin City in the southeastern region of La Uni√≥n. Bukele promised zero income tax, zero property tax, no procurement tax, zero city tax, and zero CO‚ÇÇ emissions. After almost four years, Bitcoin City remains a proposal, and no construction has commenced. Volcano Bonds, another project that promised the issuance of a $1‚ÄØbillion Bitcoin bond, was indefinitely postponed in March 2022. The delayed issuance of the ‚ÄúVolcano Bonds‚Äù was tied to global market volatility and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the country‚Äôs Finance Minister, Alejandro Zelaya, said on local TV, ‚ÄúWe believe that between March 15 and 20 is the right timing, we have the tools almost finished. But the international context will tell us ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt expect the war in Ukraine.‚Äù The LaGeo crypto mining facility, a state-owned geothermal Bitcoin mining initiative, was announced in June 2021. Bukele proposed a plan to use 100% clean, volcano-powered geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin. He even shared a video of a Bitcoin mining facility using volcanic power. As of 2025, the mining project is reportedly inactive. Other projects, like El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin-funded Chivo Pets hospital , were completely halted in March. El Salvador‚Äôs long list of failed Bitcoin projects also includes an NFT casino, the Chivo Wallet, and Chivo Pets. The lie of a continuous Bitcoin acquisition is the final nail in the coffin.

2025-07-19T17:30:26,"Today In Crypto: 3 Major Bills Passed In The US House, Here‚Äôs What You Should Know","The US House of Representatives passed three significant pieces of legislation this week, hallmarking what many in the crypto industry are calling the most impactful week for crypto policy in recent memory. The bills are meant to target the crypto market structure, stablecoin regulation, and a preemptive block against a digital dollar. Although each addresses a different segment of the crypto ecosystem, they collectively point to an improving sentiment among lawmakers regarding the growing crypto industry. House Passes CLARITY, GENIUS, And Anti-CBDC Bills First, the House gave a resounding green light to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which passed with a bipartisan vote of 294‚Äì134. The bill was created to define how cryptocurrencies should be classified, either as securities under the SEC or as commodities under the CFTC. The passage of this bill marks a major milestone in the effort to bring regulatory clarity to both investors and innovators, something that has long eluded the US crypto sector. Despite receiving support from nearly 80 Democrats, the bill was not without opposition. Critics like Representative Maxine Waters argued that the legislation could allow harmful loopholes that weaken protections for retail investors. Meanwhile, the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act sailed through the legislative chamber with even bigger support. Having already cleared the Senate in June with a 68‚Äì30 vote, the House added its stamp of approval with a 308‚Äì122 result. The GENIUS Act sets strict guardrails around stablecoins, mandating that issuers fully back their tokens with reserves, undergo monthly audits, and comply with key anti-money laundering and consumer protection frameworks. Its quick passage culminated in President Trump signing it into law on July 18, making it the first major federal regulation specifically tailored to digital assets. Rounding out the trio of bills is the controversial Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which passed by a narrower margin of 219‚Äì210. This bill proposes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Supporters of the bill argue that a digital dollar would increase state surveillance over user finances. On the other hand, the legislation reduces the Fed‚Äôs ability to respond to global trends in central banking, particularly as countries like China continue advancing their own CBDCs . What Comes Next? As it stands, the GENIUS Act regulating stablecoins is already in effect. However, the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC bill will now move to the Senate, where their fate is less certain. Interestingly, the voting dynamics in the House of Representatives show that many Democratic lawmakers are positive about the crypto market. Over 100 Democrats voted positively for the GENIUS Act, while 78 supported the CLARITY Act. The Senate is expected to scrutinize the two remaining bills more closely when it reconvenes. However, there is a high chance both bills will be passed without hiccups. Market reaction to the news has been somewhat mixed . Bitcoin continues to trade steadily just above $118,000. Ethereum initially surged to $3,670, but is now back trading around $3,500.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/3-major-bills-in-crypto/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Crypto presale|bitcoin|CBDC|CFTC|CLARITY Act|crypto|Democrats|Digital Asset Market Clarity Act|Donald Trump|Ethereum|GENIUS Act|Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins|Maxine Waters|Stablecoins|US SEC",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T17:30:17,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash: Rejection From $120K Puts Altcoins At Risk","Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has turned somewhat sluggish after its unprecedented climb to a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14. The rapid push to that level was preceded by a week of frenzied trading and heavy inflows, with BTC breaking through multiple resistance zones in quick succession. However, once that peak was hit, a series of volatile intraday movements followed to give a pullback to $116,000 and Bitcoin is now back to trading between the $117,000 and $118,500 price zone. Related Reading: If You‚Äôre Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says A notable bearish call came from crypto analyst Melikatrader94, who posted a technical breakdown on the TradingView platform that might send Bitcoin down to $113,000. QML Zone Rejection Points To Downtrend Toward $113,600 According to the hourly candlestick chart shared by Melikatrader94, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a Quasimodo Level (QML) structure. The Quasimodo Level (QML) structure is characterized by three peaks in a bearish scenario or three troughs in a bullish scenario, with the middle one being the most prominent, identifying the price. The post predicted that Bitcoin‚Äôs entry into the $119,000‚Äì$121,000 zone would draw sellers, and this was indeed the case. The quick rejection after its all-time high confirms a bearish shift in structure, and now the momentum is tilted to the downside. This rejection came after a significant price move that engulfed a previous structural support level. ‚ÄúBTC rejected from QML zone and the selloff confirms bears are active,‚Äù the analyst noted. The bearish outlook remains valid as long as Bitcoin stays below the QML zone, with the next critical support level situated at $113,600. This area could serve as a potential point for either a bounce or short-term consolidation if the price continues downward. However, a pullback is likely to occur around $116,000 before Bitcoin falls to $113,600. Altcoins Under Threat As BTC Price Weakens The potential Bitcoin crash to the $113,000 region could have serious implications for many altcoins that are already starting to post massive gains. However, these altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin‚Äôs lead, are already showing signs of nervousness as BTC struggles to maintain upward momentum. Among the notable movers, XRP finally broke its eight-year-old resistance to hit a new all-time high of $3.65. However, the rally appears to be stalling, with the token now showing early signs of a correction around the $3.45 zone. Ethereum, which also surged on the back of Bitcoin‚Äôs push to $122,000, climbed above $3,600 for the first time in months but has since settled into a consolidation phase just below $3,500.

The data visualizes how MicroStrategy‚Äôs famous Bitcoin purchases would have performed had Michael Saylor, the company‚Äôs executive chairman, chosen XRP instead. According to the post, ‚ÄúMichael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin.‚Äù Michael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/g5D9t1ukK4 ‚Äî Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 19, 2025 Chart Shows XRP Outpacing Bitcoin by 2025 The chart illustrates portfolio performance starting from August 2020 through July 2025. Both the Bitcoin and XRP portfolios initially tracked each other closely through late 2021, showing modest gains with some fluctuations. From December 2023 onwards, however, the XRP portfolio began to outperform Bitcoin significantly. Around September 2024, XRP‚Äôs cumulative value visibly exceeded Bitcoin‚Äôs and maintained its lead through to July 2025. By the end of the charted period, XRP‚Äôs hypothetical value crossed $140 billion while Bitcoin‚Äôs hovered near $70 billion. Gordon Emphasizes Missed Opportunity Gordon framed this as evidence that XRP would have yielded double the gains compared to Bitcoin over the same period. The data implies that the decision to focus solely on Bitcoin came at the expense of greater returns that could have been realized with XRP . Gordon presented the comparison as a hypothetical scenario, highlighting what he described as a missed opportunity for MicroStrategy‚Äôs treasury strategy. Responses Defend Bitcoin‚Äôs Long-Term Appeal In response to Gordon‚Äôs post , users on the platform weighed in with differing views. One user argued that the comparison overlooks Bitcoin‚Äôs unique properties. They stated that short-term gains do not outweigh long-term fundamentals, suggesting that Saylor‚Äôs choice of Bitcoin stemmed from his recognition of it as ‚Äúthe apex digital commodity‚Äù and a position unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. This user also highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs network effects and institutional adoption as key factors behind Saylor‚Äôs investment thesis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Debate Between Immediate Returns and Vision Another commenter echoed this sentiment by asserting that while XRP may have delivered superior gains over the past two years, Bitcoin laid the groundwork for the entire digital asset ecosystem. According to this perspective, Bitcoin represents a long-term bet on a future where fiat currencies decline and monetary sovereignty becomes more important. The same user emphasized that Saylor‚Äôs intent was not to pursue short-term gains but rather to align with what they described as a rewriting of monetary history. Gordon‚Äôs tweet and the attached chart focused primarily on cumulative portfolio performance, measuring the returns of each asset over nearly five years. The comparison underscored XRP‚Äôs more recent appreciation, particularly from late 2023 onwards, where its growth accelerated relative to Bitcoin. The chart clearly visualized a sharp divergence between the two portfolios as XRP climbed rapidly, while Bitcoin‚Äôs growth remained steady but comparatively subdued. Overall, the post by Gordon asserted that Saylor could have doubled MicroStrategy‚Äôs portfolio value had he opted for XRP instead of Bitcoin. However, several respondents contended that the choice of Bitcoin reflects a long-term strategy centered on digital scarcity and foundational strength, rather than short-term market performance.

In the last 24-hour period, AVAX‚Äôs price dipped around 0.5% to $23.63, but moving the timeline to 30 days shows a major 30.3% rise, slightly outperforming the wider crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, which rose 30.1%. During the rise, AVAX‚Äôs volatility was accompanied by above-average volume, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This kind of price action, where buyers step in quickly at key levels, suggests a growing confidence among traders. The token has recently exited a multi-month descending channel, a technical pattern many traders interpret as a bullish reversal.

2025-07-19T17:00:56,"2 cryptocurrencies to buy now for your retirement portfolio","Although the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, several assets are increasingly showing potential for inclusion in long-term retirement portfolios. Notably, with the U.S. advancing regulation through laws like the Genius Act, the case for crypto as a legitimate investment class is gaining traction. To this end, and beyond leading names like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), Finbold has identified the following altcoins worth considering for your retirement portfolio. Solana (SOL) Solana has matured significantly in recent years, following a near collapse in 2022 due to its ties to the FTX saga. Notably, Solana earns a place in the portfolio thanks to its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming applications. The ecosystem is also expanding, with the potential to attract institutional investors, especially with a possible spot ETF on the horizon. Solana‚Äôs architecture also appeals to developers migrating from congested and costly Ethereum chains, giving it strong forward momentum. Previously, Solana surged from $0.22 in 2020 to over $200 at its peak and has undergone upgrades aimed at improving the network. Analysts, such as VanEck, project that its price could exceed $3,200 by 2030, making it an ideal investment option. At press time, SOL was trading at $176.96, having rallied over 11% in the past week. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Hedera (HBAR) Hedera ( HBAR ) is quietly becoming the go-to network for enterprise adoption. Built on its unique Hashgraph consensus, a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchain, Hedera can process over 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. What sets HBAR apart is its governance council, composed of industry giants such as Google, IBM, LG, and Deutsche Telekom. These stakeholders not only validate the network but also build on it, demonstrating rare institutional confidence in a crypto project. Use cases include tokenization, identity verification, carbon tracking, and supply chain solutions, offering solid potential for long-term growth. At press time, HBAR was trading at $0.27, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours and 12% over the past week. HBAR one-week price chart.

2025-07-19T16:59:00,"Grok AI Predicts When Dogecoin Hits $1, Shiba Inu Hits $0.0001, and This New Meme Coin Hits $3","Grok AI has released bold new forecasts shaking up the market outlook. Dogecoin is projected to reach the $1 milestone, Shiba Inu to hit $0.0001, and newcomer Little Pepe to reach $3. However, the timeline is even more shocking. After selling out Stage 4 ahead of schedule, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has entered Stage 5 at a price of $0.0014, marking a 40% rise from its Stage 1 price. Current buyers are already positioned for a 2.14x return, with a confirmed listing at $0.003. However, Grok AI‚Äôs full projection reveals much more than a simple double, it anticipates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) reaching $3 by Q2 2026. That is a staggering 2,042x gain from today‚Äôs price, outperforming many of the top assets in circulation. Backed by over $5.8 million raised and more than 4.9 billion tokens sold in record time, the project‚Äôs acceleration isn‚Äôt slowing down. Grok AI‚Äôs Forecast: Where Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Are Headed According to Grok AI‚Äôs latest projections, Dogecoin is expected to reach $1 by April 2026, a nearly 5x increase from its current price of $0.20. This trajectory is supported by steady adoption, integration with payment systems, and potential market-wide momentum following anticipated Bitcoin surges. Shiba Inu, currently trading at $0.0000134, is forecasted to hit $0.0001 by late 2025, marking a projected 7.5x return. While both tokens have strong community backing, Grok‚Äôs data suggests Dogecoin‚Äôs growth may be more short-term event-driven, while Shiba Inu‚Äôs path depends more on ecosystem expansion like Shibarium. These predictions also provide a performance benchmark for newer entrants such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which Grok forecasts could reach $3, far surpassing both in relative ROI. Stage 4 Sells Out Quickly as $5.9 M Raised Momentum continues to build around Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with Stage 4 of the presale completely selling out. Over 4.8 billion tokens were snapped up, bringing in $5.9 million. With that phase now closed, the price has moved up to $0.0014 in Stage 5.

This third-party validation adds an extra layer of trust for those just discovering the project.

This approach aims to solve the performance issues seen on many older networks. $777,000 Giveaway Now Live A massive giveaway is now underway, with $777,000 in prizes.
