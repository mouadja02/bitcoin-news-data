2025-07-19T13:52:08,"Analysis Company CEO Issues Serious Warning: ‚ÄúBitcoin May Be Setting A Trap For Altcoins‚Äù","Joao Wedson, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal, warned in his latest assessment that Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall market could face a sharp move in the short term. In his statement on social media, Wedson highlighted several technical signals and urged investors to be cautious about a possible bearish scenario. ‚ÄúAfter reviewing several charts today, the picture is still not completely clear. However, given the heavy open long positions in the market, the possibility of a significant decline in the coming hours is quite realistic,‚Äù Wedson said in a statement. The key points in Wedson's assessment are as follows: Correlation Warning: A heatmap showing a breakdown in correlation between BTC and altcoins could be a sign of increased market volatility. According to Wedson, this type of divergence often precedes a volatility storm. Altcoin Season Index: Although the rising Altcoin Season Index is generally interpreted as a positive signal for altcoins, according to Wedson, BTC ‚Äúdoes not like‚Äù this situation and can often intervene suddenly in the market during these processes. Alpha Quant Sell Signal: Wedson noted that the Alpha Quant algorithm recently issued a ‚Äúsell‚Äù signal. He explained that this signal was anticipated due to selling pressure from some whales and a technically emerging downtrend. Related News: Unexpected Statement from Swiss Investment Giant Official: ‚ÄúYes, Ethereum is Up A Lot, But This Altcoin Will Do Even Better‚Äù Joao Wedson stated that he doesn't think the market is in its final stages, but that such movements could signal the formation of a new price base. He concluded by saying, ‚ÄúThis decline may not be final, but we must remain vigilant. We especially need to remain vigilant against potential pitfalls.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-19T13:50:35,"Ripple Price Analysis: Is XRP About to Explode Above $4 This Week?","XRP has finally broken out of months of consolidation, reclaiming critical levels against both USDT and BTC. This breakout comes as broader market sentiment shifts bullish, with Ethereum and Bitcoin also showing strong rallies. Volume and momentum are backing the move, but traders should stay alert for potential profit-taking or short-term pullbacks following such sharp advances. Ripple Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan XRP/USDT Analysis Against USDT, XRP has smashed through the long-standing $3.00 resistance zone, which had previously acted as a ceiling during several failed breakout attempts. The move was clean and impulsive, with the price now pushing toward the $4.00 psychological resistance level. This is the next major mark to watch, as it is likely a potential target for many buyers. The RSI is also sitting above 80, showing strong momentum, but also flashing caution for potential short-term overextension. Looking at the structure, XRP broke above the descending wedge that had capped price action for the past 6 months. This shift marks a clear change in market character. As long as the XRP price stays above the $3.00 region, buyers are in control. A deeper retracement into the breakout zone could offer a high-probability retest entry. Losing $3.00 again, however, would invalidate the breakout and suggest a return to the range. Source: TradingView XRP/BTC Analysis The XRP/BTC pair has surged impressively, breaking above the key 2,500 SAT high and the 200-day moving average located nearby. It is now testing the upper boundary of a major supply zone around 3,000 SAT. This level previously acted as a distribution zone several times during earlier rallies and has now become the battleground between buyers and profit-takers. The XRP price has also created a fair value gap just below the current price, which could act as a short-term support to help push the price through the 3,000 SAT zone. Moreover, the RSI is currently hovering around 88, suggesting overheated conditions that may lead to short-term cooling. If XRP holds above the 2,500 SAT region, the bullish structure remains intact, and continuation above the 3,000 SAT resistance band becomes likely. However, any rejection from 3,000 SAT could trigger a pullback to retest the 200-day moving average around 2500 SAT.

2025-07-19T13:14:01,"Charles Schwab CEO Says Crypto Trading Is Coming Soon, Will Compete With Coinbase for Retail","Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) is preparing to launch trading for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as it aims to become a dominant player in digital asset custody for U.S. retail investors, according to CEO Rick Wurster. Speaking Friday on CNBC‚Äôs ""Money Movers"", Wurster said Schwab clients already have significant crypto exposure through exchange-traded products ‚Äî accounting for more than 20% of the industry's holdings in that segment ‚Äî but many have expressed interest in keeping their actual tokens with Schwab, rather than at crypto-native platforms. Crypto still represents a small slice of Schwab‚Äôs business, Wurster said, with about $25 billion in digital assets held across $10.8 trillion in total client wealth. But he framed Schwab‚Äôs upcoming product launch as a potential inflection point. ‚ÄúOur clients want their crypto to sit alongside their stocks, bonds and cash ‚Äî not off to the side on a different app,‚Äù he said. Schwab anticipates demand will accelerate once it introduces direct access to bitcoin and ether custody and trading. The comments came just hours before President Trump was scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act, legislation aimed at bolstering U.S. blockchain competitiveness. The policy backdrop could further incentivize large brokerages to expand their crypto offerings, especially as the regulatory environment shifts in favor of mainstream financial firms. When asked whether Schwab‚Äôs upcoming platform would compete with Coinbase, Wurster replied: ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù He added that the company would welcome a scenario where clients migrate their crypto holdings away from other platforms and consolidate them under Schwab‚Äôs umbrella. While no timeline was provided, the announcement positions Schwab ‚Äî already one of the largest brokerages in the U.S. ‚Äî to become a major player in retail crypto access, particularly for older and higher-net-worth clients seeking integration with traditional portfolios. Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. closed at $95.80 on Friday, up 2.9% for the day. The stock opened at $95.70 and reached an intraday high of $97.50, matching its 52-week peak, before paring gains. Schwab‚Äôs market capitalization stood at $174.07 billion, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.47 and a dividend yield of 1.13%, according to Google Finance data.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/19/charles-schwab-ceo-says-crypto-trading-is-coming-soon-will-compete-with-coinbase-for-retail,"TRADING|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS","Markets|Bitcoin|Ethereum|btc|ETH|Charles Schwab|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-19T13:03:34,"AVAX/BTC Pair Signals Strong Rally For AVAX Price","The post AVAX/BTC Pair Signals Strong Rally For AVAX Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Avalanche price (AVAX) has broken out of a multi-month descending channel in July which caught the attention of many traders and could result in a strong move ahead. The AVAX price has been trading in a bear market since December 2023, although the current strength suggests an impressive change in the technical structure. Should those external conditions remain supportive, the move could provide a backdrop for a broader rally if momentum holds, the more so as analysts forecast higher AVAX price targets in the coming weeks. Breakout from Channel Ignites Bullish Sentiment In Avalanche The break above the descending channel is a key technical upside development for AVAX price action here in 2025. Analyst Ali Martinez echoed a similar sentiment, explaining that traders could use the current momentum as a launchpad for higher momentum, if it reclaim some key levels first. In particular, a prolonged gain above the $26 mark would likely advance the positive setup and encourage fresh capital in the market. Avalanche $AVAX is approaching a major resistance at $26. A breakout here could open the door for a significant move! pic.twitter.com/eiNxgYpbbw ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 19, 2025 This assessment is further echoed by Ted Pillows , too. He shared a technical chart identifying a converging declining wedge pattern. The breakout from this pattern has been clean, signaling a structural shift away from lower highs and compressed price action. According to Ted, this breakout opens up the possibility of a price advance into the $32 to $35 zone over the next one to two weeks, assuming the current trend remains intact. BTC Pair Breakout Reinforces Technical Shift In a separate observation, CryptoKaleo pointed to the AVAX/BTC trading pair, which has now broken above a long-standing resistance trendline which was active since 2021. This move carries significant implications because the AVAX price has struggled to outperform Bitcoin over the past few years, but this breakout flips everything. The current multi-year structure break has flipped its narrative from bearish to bullish, and this act as a secondary confirmation of the AVAX/USD pairs ongoing trend reversal. $AVAX / $BTC broke out of a resistance dating back to its 2021 highs. This is going to rip so hard. pic.twitter.com/fG1xOomb9p ‚Äî K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 18, 2025 Moreover, analyst Planfomo added to the optimistic tone, projecting a potential target of $47 should AVAX successfully break out and hold above the $26‚Äì$27 range. Though such targets remain conditional on sustained market strength, they do highlight the increasing confidence in AVAX crypto‚Äôs technical outlook across different analysts. On-Chain and Derivatives Metrics Signal Growing Confidence The broader market trends indicate that the bulls are coming back in full force. The funding rates and open interest data indicate traders are leaning toward bullish scenarios. An increase in the funding rate is usually associated with long traders while an increasing open interest also indicates increased participation.

2025-07-19T13:00:32,"Will Bitcoin Impede Or Support Altcoin Rally? On-Chain Data Signals Market Uncertainty","According to an on-chain analyst on X, Bitcoin has decoupled from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the market over the next day. Why Traders Should Brace For Impact In a July 18 post on the social media platform X, Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics firm Alphractal, reported that the Bitcoin price might witness a significant drop over the next day. The crypto analyst based his conclusion on multiple results obtained from on-chain analysis using three major metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trades Above $117K as Whale Deposits Decline and Stablecoin Inflows Rise First, Wedson referenced an earlier post made on X by Alphractal, saying that the market is currently dominated by long positions. According to the analyst, the effect of these long positions wouldn‚Äôt necessarily last long in a market where the shorts have been liquidated ‚Äî a phenomenon which also holds for the reverse case. The chart above is from the Correlation Heatmap ‚Äì BTCUSDT versus ALTCOINS metric, which reads the trajectory of the two crypto categories and compares them. Using the chart as a foundation, Wedson mentioned that altcoins are decoupling from Bitcoin. When altcoins cease to follow the premier cryptocurrency‚Äôs lead, the development could be subject to a couple of interpretations, which affect market sentiment. As a result, it is normal to expect increased market volatility. Wedson also referenced the Altcoin Season Index Vs Bitcoin metric, which is used to measure if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin within a specific period. According to the analyst, this Altcoin Season Index is currently on the rise, which is typically a positive sign for the altcoins. However, if historical trends are anything to go by, a rising Altcoin Season Index might be a negative signal for Bitcoin. Wedson explained that the Bitcoin market might experience a dump, dragging along with it the currently rising Altcoins, to re-establish market balance. The crypto pundit also cited the Alpha Quant Signal as an influence in his conclusion. Wedson pointed out that the metric flashed a sell, which was expected, seeing as some significant whales recently added to the sell pressure on Bitcoin by selling a fraction of their holdings. Outlook For The Altcoins Even as the market flashes ominous signs, Joao Wedson expressed optimism in the viability of the beginning of an altcoin rally, saying he doesn‚Äôt believe this is the final leg down for the crypto market. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs likely a sign that the market is about to form a new price base. So be cautious with the traps that might show up along the way,‚Äù the analyst added.

2025-07-19T13:00:24,"Bitcoin Advocate To Replace Cops With His Own Security In Bedford","Bitcoin podcaster and Real Bedford FC owner Peter McCormack is taking matters into his own hands in his hometown of Bedford, UK. With rising concerns over public safety, McCormack says he‚Äôs stepping up where the police have fallen short ‚Äî by paying for a group of private security guards to patrol the streets every Saturday. The town, home to around 185,800 people and located under two hours from London, has seen an increase in what McCormack calls ‚Äúaggressive beggars,‚Äù shoplifting, and harassment. ‚ÄúThe police have failed us,‚Äù he said in a post on X. ‚ÄúMore crackheads, more aggressive beggars, more shoplifters, and therefore fewer people coming into town.‚Äù Security Teams To Patrol On Saturdays McCormack said he warned Bedford police before announcing the plan. Now, he‚Äôs personally funding a pilot program that sends 10 guards to monitor the town center every Saturday. According to him, this is all about making the streets safer for women, children, and families who no longer feel comfortable going out. Announcing my private security pilot for Bedford Town Centre ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Starting this August, I‚Äôm personally funding a pilot project to provide private security in Bedford. Every Saturday, 10 guards will patrol the town centre and oversee safe parking at Lurke‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Peter McCormack (@PeterMcCormack) July 18, 2025 It‚Äôs not yet clear how far these guards can go in stopping crime. In the UK, taking justice into your own hands isn‚Äôt just frowned upon ‚Äî it could be illegal. According to law experts at JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors, vigilantism is against the law. So while McCormack‚Äôs plan might sound bold, the details of how it will work within legal limits are still uncertain. Community Support And Football Backing McCormack isn‚Äôt just a podcast personality ‚Äî he‚Äôs a visible figure in the town‚Äôs business and sports scene. He owns several businesses in Bedford and also runs Real Bedford FC, a club often referred to as the ‚Äú Bitcoin soccer team.‚Äù That nickname comes from the backing of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founders of Gemini, who have invested in the team. To build momentum behind his crime-fighting effort, McCormack said he surveyed locals and is organizing a community meeting. He wants residents to get involved and share their experiences and ideas for making Bedford safer. Private Security Fills Gaps In Other Cities Bedford isn‚Äôt the only place looking outside traditional police forces. In San Francisco, Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the city‚Äôs police department said private security is increasingly stepping in to handle public safety, especially as law enforcement struggles with staffing issues. ‚ÄúPrivate security is already playing a crucial role,‚Äù Altorfer said in May. But he stressed that for it to work, there has to be coordination between private firms and police ‚Äî not conflict. As McCormack‚Äôs plan moves forward, the focus will be on how the guards are trained, how they operate, and whether they work alongside the police or against them. For now, Bedford has a Bitcoin-backed football club owner willing to spend money to make the streets safer ‚Äî whether the law sees it the same way is a question still hanging in the air.
