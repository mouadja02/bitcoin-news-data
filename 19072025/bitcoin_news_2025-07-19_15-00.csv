2025-07-19T12:50:38,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week‚Äôs Crypto News Highlights | 19 July, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week‚Äôs Crypto News Highlights | 19 July, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Big week for crypto and a big one for regulation! The U.S is making fast decisions, Ripple vs SEC is back to make headlines, and fresh momentum built around some of the industry‚Äôs biggest tokens. There‚Äôs policy, price action, and just enough controversy to keep things interesting. If you missed anything, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì I‚Äôve put the key updates in one place. Let‚Äôs dive in. #1 Gamechanger for Crypto? GENIUS Act Is Now Official It‚Äôs official: the U.S. just passed its first real stablecoin law. The GENIUS Act, a long-awaited bill to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins, was signed into law by President Trump after clearing the House with bipartisan support (308-122). The new rules require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, with monthly public reserve disclosures. Trump called it ‚Äúa giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology.‚Äù It‚Äôs the clearest signal yet that stablecoins are going mainstream; now with rules to match. #2 Trump to Allow 401(k) Investments in Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity Donald Trump is preparing to open up America‚Äôs $9 trillion retirement savings market to crypto, gold, and private equity. A new executive order, expected this week, would push regulators to clear the way for 401(k) plans to include alternative investments, not just stocks and bonds. The White House says Trump is focused on ‚Äúrestoring prosperity for everyday Americans.‚Äù It‚Äôs also a major win for crypto, coming after Trump backed multiple digital asset bills and rolled back restrictions on crypto in retirement accounts. #3 SC Becomes First Global Bank to Offer Regulated BTC, ETH Trading Standard Chartered just became the first global bank to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service, rolled out via its UK subsidiary, is aimed squarely at institutions. Clients can now trade BTC and ETH on the same system they already use for currencies. This is part of a much bigger strategy that‚Äôs been years in the making, from Zodia Custody to Libeara. As CEO Bill Winters put it: ‚ÄúDigital assets are a fundamental part of the evolution of financial services.‚Äù #4 No Surprise, But No Relief: CPI at 2.7% in June June‚Äôs inflation data came out this week. Consumer prices in the U.S. rose 0.3% from May, pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 2.9% year-over-year, in line with forecasts. That might sound mild, but it‚Äôs enough to keep the Fed cautious. Some categories, like household goods and electronics, saw sharp price jumps, likely reflecting new tariffs. The takeaway is that rate cuts are still likely, but probably not before September. Bitcoin reacted with a quick drop but steadied itself. #5 ‚Çπ1,500 Cr in XRP Moved Before WazirX Hack ‚Äì Coinpedia Investigates A viral tweet from anonymous user @TOOFAANARMY is raising eyebrows: over ‚Çπ1,500 crore worth of XRP was moved from a WazirX-linked wallet just before the platform‚Äôs ‚Çπ2,000 crore hack. WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty tells Coinpedia it was routine user activity and cold wallet consolidation, not unusual. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an account with Binance,‚Äù he added, pushing back on claims of direct transfers. The wallet was public on their Proof of Reserves page. For now, the claim remains unverified. #6 Grayscale Starts Process to Go Public The crypto investment firm has filed a confidential draft registration with the U.S. SEC, signaling plans for an IPO. For now, details like the number of shares and pricing are still undecided. The move won‚Äôt go forward until the SEC review is complete and market conditions are right. By choosing a confidential filing, Grayscale keeps its early plans private while testing investor interest behind the scenes. If the IPO goes ahead, it could help the company reach more investors and grow its role in traditional finance. #7 Crypto Market Cap Nears $4T, Chasing Nvidia Crypto had a massive day on Friday! The total market cap inched close to $4 trillion, driven by sharp gains in Ethereum and XRP after the U.S. House passed three major crypto bills. Bitcoin crossed $120,000 again, but ETH jumped 8% to hit $3,600, and XRP soared 20% to a new yearly high of $3.64. Binance‚Äôs CoinMarketCap puts total market cap at $3.8T, while TradingView shows $3.9T ‚Äì higher than the last peak in December. As LVRG‚Äôs Nick Ruck put it, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre optimistic‚Ä¶ as institutions race to advance integration with the crypto industry.‚Äù #8 Ripple vs. SEC Drags On Despite $125M Settlement Ripple has paid the full $125 million SEC penalty and it was all in cash, not XRP. That clears up recent rumours about a crypto payout. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel confirmed the court required a cash-only settlement. But the lawsuit isn‚Äôt over yet. Both Ripple and the SEC still need to withdraw their appeals before the case officially closes. Until then, the money stays locked in escrow. They already paid in cash. Sorry. ‚Äî Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 16, 2025 Meanwhile, XRP has jumped 29% this week and is trading above $3.15, showing strong momentum. #9 Bitcoin Beats Gold as 2025‚Äôs Top Asset Bitcoin finally stole the crown! With a $123,000 price peak this week and a 30% year-to-date surge, BTC overtook gold to become 2025‚Äôs best-performing asset. But behind the breakout is a far deeper signal. As Charlie Bilello put it, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen these two in the number one and number two spots.‚Äù When Bitcoin and gold lead together, it might seem optimistic but it‚Äôs warning signs. People are scared and running to shelter. Something to think about‚Ä¶ #10 Cross-Chain Crime Tripled Since 2023, Says Elliptic Crypto crime is getting harder to stop and bigger in size. A new report from Elliptic shows criminals moved over $21.8 billion through DEXs, cross-chain bridges, and swap tools this year ‚Äì three times more than in 2023. Around $2.5 billion is linked to North Korean hackers, with another $300 million tied to Iranian services under U.S. sanctions. One in three investigations now involve more than three blockchains. As scams and laundering move across networks, Elliptic says full-chain visibility is the only way to keep up. In the Spotlight Here‚Äôs a few quick hits you shouldn‚Äôt miss! Citi Joins the Stablecoin Race: Jane Fraser confirms the bank is exploring its own digital token, with crypto custody and tokenized deposits also on the table amid new support from Trump‚Äôs Genius Act and relaxed Fed rules. PUMP Token Raises $600M in 12 Minutes: Solana-based platform Pump.fun launched its memecoin with explosive demand, triggering high-volume trading and speculation across spot and derivatives markets as traders scramble for exposure during the token‚Äôs distribution phase. Trump Denies Plan to Fire Fed Chair Powell: Despite reports of a draft termination letter, Trump says he‚Äôs ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù to remove Jerome Powell , unless it‚Äôs over fraud, but criticism of rate policies continues to mount. El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin Holdings Top $760M: Despite past criticism, the country‚Äôs BTC stash has tripled in 2025, with over 6,200 coins now worth more than $760 million as Bitcoin pushes new all-time highs. DOJ Ends Polymarket Probe in Win for Crypto Bets: The betting platform is no longer under investigation by U.S. regulators, after months of scrutiny following the 2024 election and an FBI raid on CEO Shayne Coplan‚Äôs home. What‚Äôs Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Stablecoins may move further into the financial mainstream, now backed by real rules, real reserves and the biggest banks watching closely. Institutional crypto access could widen fast if Trump‚Äôs 401(k) order goes through, bringing billions in retirement capital into play. As inflation lingers and rate cuts stall, markets may stay jumpy but crypto‚Äôs momentum suggests traders are betting big on a September pivot. The GENIUS Act‚Äôs ripple effect is already visible, with Citi and Standard Chartered both pushing deeper into tokenized finance. Regulators face pressure to keep up with crypto crime and increasingly complex laundering tactics. That‚Äôs all for now but the next shake-up is never far in crypto.

According to Zeberg, the stock could soon present ‚Äúthe greatest shorting opportunity,‚Äù he said in an X post on July 18. #MSTR will be the greatest shorting opportunity of a life time! Not yet! But it is coming ‚Äî Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 18, 2025 Zeberg cautioned that Strategy‚Äôs deep exposure to Bitcoin may eventually crash its balance sheet, stating that every time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it ‚Äúplants a small bomb‚Äù in its financials. He argued that the risk isn‚Äôt if Bitcoin tumbles again, but when. According to Zeberg, such a scenario could damage not only Strategy‚Äôs market capitalization but also its cash flow, access to credit, and investor confidence. ‚ÄúEvery time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it plants a small bomb in its balance sheet. Not if BTC tumbles again ‚Äî but when ‚Äî those bombs go off. And when they do, they don‚Äôt just dent the market cap. They hit cash flow, credit lines, and confidence,‚Äù he added. It‚Äôs worth noting that Strategy‚Äôs pivot toward Bitcoin has been led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, who doubled down on his conviction, claiming that ‚Äúthe only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs bet has so far paid off, with the stock having surged approximately 3,500% over the past five years, outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 905% rise over the same period. MSTR short interest rising But while Strategy continues to outpace both Bitcoin and traditional market benchmarks, short sellers are taking notice. According to the latest data retrieved from Fintel by Finbold on July 19, short volume in MSTR has risen significantly. On July 18, 2025, short volume stood at 3.76 million shares out of a total trading volume of 6.74 million, resulting in a short volume ratio of 55.7%, the highest in the past ten trading days. Short interest has remained elevated throughout the period, with ratios consistently above 47% on most days, suggesting mounting bearish sentiment. MSTR short volume.

Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster says in a new interview with CNBC that they want to expand services for their clients, who are already significantly invested in crypto. ‚ÄúOur clients hold more than 20% of the exchange-traded product crypto in the entire industry, so they‚Äôre invested.

2025-07-19T12:20:25,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki: What AI Predicts About Their Future After Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH","Artificial intelligence offers new insights on the future of popular meme coins in the wake of Bitcoin's all-time high. Curious minds will discover predictions that reveal which cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki, are poised for significant growth. Dive into the analysis to uncover which digital assets may lead the next wave of the crypto boom. The analysis is provided by Outset PR , a data-driven communications agency specializing in strategic crypto insights. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Edges Up Amid Optimistic Market Sentiment Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is oscillating between 0.00001187 and 0.00001429 dollars. It shows a 21.74% climb in the past month. SHIB is aiming to break the nearest hurdle at 0.00001529 dollars. If successful, it could push towards the second resistance at 0.00001771 dollars, marking a leap of about 25% from its current stance. The coin's trajectory stays hopeful as it hovers above a supportive line at 0.00001045 dollars. Despite a rough six months, reflecting a 40.31% dip, the short-term indicators hint at a potential rebound, suggesting that SHIB could attract interest from traders seeking upward movement. Dogecoin Price Holds Steady; Eyes 30% Jump to Resistance Source: tradingview Dogecoin is experiencing a stable phase, hovering between 17 and 22 cents. Its recent momentum indicates a 19% rise in the past week and a 26% increase over the past month. The coin's upcoming challenge is the resistance level at 24 cents. If buyers gain traction, Dogecoin might jump to this level, marking nearly a 30% increase from current prices. The Relative Strength Index at around 66 suggests room for more buying power. For those optimistic about Dogecoin, the 29-cent mark is the next target. However, any downturn could see a retreat to the support at 14 cents, so buyers need to watch these key levels. FLOKI Coin Shows Strong Weekly Rise Amidst Constant Volatility Source: tradingview FLOKI is on the rise, with a recent price jump seen over the past week. The coin is currently priced between an eighth and a tenth of a cent. It is pushing towards the nearest resistance at about twelve-thousandths of a cent. Its weekly increase is over forty percent, hinting at solid upward momentum, though it's still below the ten-day moving average. Should it break through resistance, FLOKI could see potential growth to nearly fourteen-thousandths of a cent, which is almost thirty-two percent above its range. While the month has been bullish with nearly seventy percent growth, price fluctuations remain a hallmark for this crypto.

There is also no indication that the figure corresponded to any real market trade or reflected legitimate exchange pricing at the moment in question. XRP Community Continues to Express Optimism Despite the likelihood that the displayed price was a mistake, the post drew renewed commentary on XRP‚Äôs long-term potential . The notion that XRP could be on the same level or overtake Bitcoin in value someday remains a persistent belief among some supporters. These individuals often reference XRP‚Äôs integration with cross-border payment systems and institutional pilots as reasons for their outlook. While the broader market did not reflect any similar valuation at the time of the screenshot, the viral nature of the image and the reactions it generated show that speculation surrounding XRP‚Äôs future remains active. As of now, there has been no further clarification from CoinListings or any confirmation that the $118,263 price was anything other than a temporary glitch.
