2025-07-19T10:50:37,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Genius Act Becomes Law After Tumultuous Crypto Week – What’s the BTC Impact?","President Donald Trump signed the landmark GENIUS Act into law on Friday afternoon , capping a tumultuous “Crypto Week” that saw Bitcoin navigate significant volatility before establishing new institutional legitimacy. The stablecoin legislation passed the House 308-122 after Trump’s Tuesday night Oval Office intervention with Republican holdouts rescued it from legislative limbo. Bitcoin is currently trading around $119,000 and has pulled back from its all-time high of $123,000 , but maintains critical support levels, suggesting continued bullish momentum. The breakthrough followed an initial 196-223 defeat that seemed like the end. Trump’s diplomacy secured a 215-211 procedural victory , clearing the path for final passage. The GENIUS Act establishes federal licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers and explicitly prohibits the creation of central bank digital currencies. Industry executives hailed the legislation as the beginning of a new regulatory era, which is expected to accelerate institutional adoption. With Bitcoin forming flag consolidation patterns following recent volatility, technical analysis suggests the current pullback represents an accumulation opportunity before the next leg higher toward $180,000 targets. Flag Pattern Consolidation Targets $181,040 Breakout Bitcoin’s chart structure reveals progression through ascending flag patterns that have consistently resolved upward throughout the current bull cycle. The recent pullback from $123,000 to current levels is forming another flag consolidation within the broader uptrend. Each previous breakout was preceded by a major upward move following a period of consolidation. The measured move projection above $150,000 represents approximately 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This technical methodology has proven accurate throughout Bitcoin’s bull run. Key support areas have consistently attracted buyers during previous pullbacks, suggesting that similar dynamics may be at play now. Flag patterns within strong uptrends typically represent continuation rather than reversal signals. Current price action suggests that Bitcoin is building momentum for another explosive move once the pattern is complete. Long-Term Holders Drive Healthy Distribution Pattern Additionally, on-chain analysis reveals that recent selling pressure stems from holders with a tenure of 10 years or more taking profits, rather than a broad-based distribution. These longest-term holders, who acquired Bitcoin at extremely low prices, have been selling after Bitcoin reached new highs above $120,000. The selling spike is substantial but appears contained to this specific age cohort. Source: Coinvo Historical context proves revealing. Previous major selling from long-term holders occurred in March 2024, coinciding with a price correction but ultimately followed by Bitcoin’s rally to new highs. This pattern suggests selling pressure gets absorbed by new demand without derailing broader uptrends. Current selling pressure is moderating based on recent data. This profit-taking benefits long-term sustainability by transferring Bitcoin from early adopters to new participants more likely to hold at current levels. BTC Hyper: Last Chance for $HYPER Presale Before Window Closes The passage of the GENIUS Act creates unprecedented regulatory clarity, positioning Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions for explosive growth. BTC Hyper’s $HYPER token presale has raised over $3.5 million toward its presale target, with a few days remaining before the presale window closes permanently. Early investors are rushing to secure positions in the platform that enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions while unlocking DeFi capabilities. The $HYPER token offers exclusive benefits, including high APY staking rewards for presale participants and governance rights in the upcoming DAO launch. With federal stablecoin licensing now established, BTC Hyper’s wrapped Bitcoin functionality becomes increasingly valuable for institutional participants seeking a regulatory-compliant Bitcoin utility. The platform’s mainnet launch in Q3/Q4 2025 will coincide with major exchange listings. Time is running out for interested investors to participate in the $HYPER token presale at current pricing before the allocation sells out.

2025-07-19T10:44:25,"BTC inflows to exchanges hit 81K BTC as whales, miners cash in on rally","Bitcoin miners have resumed selling BTC following the flagship asset reaching a new all-time high. On-chain data analytics provider CryptoQuant noted that outflows from miners reached 16,000 BTC on July 15. According to the firm , this has been the largest outflow from miners since April 7. With the miners moving all the BTC to exchanges, CryptoQuant noted that they might have sold in reaction to BTC’s new all-time high. Bitcoin miners’ outflow metrics (Source: CryptoQuant) It said: “The total miner outflows, transfers of Bitcoin out of miners’ wallets, spiked to 16K BTC on July 15, representing an extreme outflow according to our metrics.” The recent selloffs by miners have already been reflected in the Miner Position Index (MPI) surge, according to crypto analyst Avocado_Onchain. The analyst noted that the MPI, which indicates miners’ transfer to exchange, has increased to 2.7, which could bring more short-term selling pressure to the market. Meanwhile, miners are not the only ones selling BTC at the present top. CryptoQuant data noted that overall Bitcoin transfers to exchanges have increased since BTC hit the $123,000 peak, with whales being a major driver for the spike. CryptoQuant stated: “Total daily Bitcoin exchange inflows surged from 19K Bitcoin a week ago to 81K BTC on July 15, after Bitcoin reached its most recent record-high price.” Data shows that whales are responsible for this increase, with the large BTC holders sending 58,000 BTC this week compared to 13,000 last week. These fund movements reflect profit-taking efforts by whales capitalizing on retail investors’ resurgent interest in Bitcoin. For miners, most of whom have been holding on to mined BTC to boost their BTC treasury, the selloff over the past week is likely them taking advantage of the price to quickly generate more cash flow. ETH sees spike in exchange deposits Interestingly, it was not only Bitcoin that saw increased exchange inflows in the past week. Even Ether , which recently returned to green for the first time this year, appears to be experiencing some selloffs already. CryptoQuant data shows that daily Ether inflows to exchanges reached almost 2 million ETH on July 16, the highest level since February. This shows that the 131% rally that ETH has experienced since April has finally returned it to a price where investors are open to selling. However, altcoin inflows transactions were relatively muted, contrary to what usually follows market rallies such as this. It is a sign that investors are not rushing to sell, likely because most altcoins remain within minimal gains or even small losses year-to-date, making it unattractive for investors to sell. BTC declines, but analysts believe the crypto market rally remains on Meanwhile, the recent selloffs have led to a price correction that has seen BTC drop from its peak to $118,000 while altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP also recorded a similar drop in value. However, most market observers consider the decline a mere correction rather than the end of the market rally. Avocado_Onchain noted that the effect of miners selling will depend on whether it is a one-off or sustained event. He said; “While this spike in MPI suggests the possibility of short-term correction or sideways price action, it remains far below the extreme levels typically observed at the end of previous bull cycles.” Therefore, he believes the “mid-to-long term bullish outlook for Bitcoin remains intact” and expects that the flagship asset will continue to trend upward for the time being as the underlying factors support this trajectory. Other analysts also share this view, with on-chain analyst Crypto Dan also noting no sign of overheating in the market compared to March and December 2024. Thus, the crypto market might still see new highs in the second half of the year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-19T10:43:21,"Bitcoin Sets New High, XRP Touches $3—Meanwhile, XYZVerse Presale Aims for $1B Milestone","Bitcoin's price has soared to a record level, and XRP has climbed to $3. At the same time, a new project called XYZVerse is in its presale phase, aiming to reach a billion-dollar funding milestone. The market is buzzing with speculation, and the outcomes of these trends are keenly anticipated. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin (BTC) has seen notable gains recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 6.29%. Looking at the past month, the price rose by 10.74%. Over the last six months, there's a growth of 13.99%. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $111134 and $122428. The nearest resistance level is at $126231, which is about 3% above the current upper range. The nearest support level is at $103644, approximately 7% below the lower end of the current range. If Bitcoin breaks above the first resistance, it could target the second resistance level at $137525, which is around 9% higher. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $118407 and $118501 respectively, suggesting a stable trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 46.64, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is -12.99, which may signal some bearish momentum. However, the recent positive price changes suggest potential for further growth if Bitcoin surpasses the resistance levels. Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView Over the past week, XRP has experienced a significant surge, with its price increasing by 32.31%. In the last month, the cryptocurrency climbed by 42.18%. However, looking at the six-month change, XRP's price has dipped by 3.42%. Currently, XRP is trading within a range of $2.40 to $3.12. Short-term indicators point to a bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average sits at $3.09, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $2.93. This suggests a positive trend in the near term. The Relative Strength Index is high at 75.96, and the Stochastic value stands at 93.66, indicating that XRP might be overbought. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $3.41. Breaking through this could see XRP aiming for the second resistance at $4.14, which would be an increase of about 32.7% from the current high. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1.96. If prices fall below this, the next support is at $1.23, representing a significant drop from current levels. Conclusion While BTC and XRP rise, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting fans in a community-driven, sustainable ecosystem.

2025-07-19T10:40:04,"Solana Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: SOL Price Targets $500 Next?","The post Solana Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: SOL Price Targets $500 Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Solana Price Today is $ 177.52340587 . Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, the REX-Osprey Solana ETF saw $69.7 million worth of inflows. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $177.24 with an intraday drop of 0.94%. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world. Table of contents Story Highlights Solana Price Today Solana Price Prediction for July 2025 Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Solana Price Forecast 2026 SOL Price Analysis 2027 Solana Coin Price Prediction 2028 SOL Coin Price Prediction 2029 Solana Price Prediction 2030 Solana (SOL) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Solana Price Today Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $ 177.52340587 -1.09% Market cap $ 95,494,601,318.1469 Circulating Supply 537,926,820.6951 Trading Volume $ 5,917,835,178.5083 All-time high $294.33 on 19th January 2025 All-time low $0.5052 on 12th May 2020 Solana Price Prediction for July 2025 Solana is currently trading at $177.24, with strong weekly gains of 9%. The RSI at 71.38 indicates overbought conditions, while the levels above $177 suggest bullish continuation toward the $200–$209 resistance zone. However, the 6% dip in volume signals weakening momentum in the short term. If buying pressure revives, SOL may aim for $200 soon. Otherwise, a pullback toward the $158–$152.5 support zone remains on the table before any renewed push toward its $294 ATH. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $158 $180 $209 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $8.19 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $870M–$498M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-19T10:36:09,"Donald Trump Says Bitcoin and Crypto Have Outperformed Every Stock Over the Last Year","The massive upsurge of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies also caught the attention of Donald Trump, who has lauded their impressive performance. Trump acknowledged their stellar outing in a speech shortly after signing the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill on Friday. In his remarks, he highlighted the former fate of the crypto industry and how his support has turned its fortunes around.Trump’s Adoption: The Turning PointFor context, the president noted that the digital asset sector has faced severe marginalization from past administrations. He stated that the differential treatment existed “as little as a year and a half ago,” under the Biden tenure.Trump has repeatedly criticized the poor handling of cryptocurrency innovation by former President Joe Biden and his US SEC Chair, Gary Gensler . More often than that, he has also highlighted how his intervention has been a turning point for the industry.The pro-Bitcoin president reiterated this in his Friday speech, after signing the first federal crypto bill in US history. He noted that the stablecoin passing is a massive validation of the changing tides from “being mocked and dismissed and counted out” to a mainstream sector in the US economy.In truth, the current environment has been conducive for digital assets. Trump’s flirtation with the industry has drawn institutional interest, evident in the growing number of crypto corporate treasury firms and the persistent inflows into the US Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs .Other nation-states have also paid attention to the development, with some planning to follow in the US’s footsteps. This has drawn massive demand for cryptocurrencies and sparked the rally seen over the last year.Bitcoin Outperforms Major StocksMeanwhile, even Trump appears to be keeping tabs on the crypto price pump. “I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock or just about more,” he told the crypto executives present on Friday.Interestingly, Bitcoin has performed exceptionally well over the past year, primarily due to Trump’s endorsement and massive demand. For context, BTC is up 85% from its price of $63,990 a year ago. It would have been a better percentage gain a few days ago when Bitcoin rallied to its new all-time high of $123,181.In comparison to major stocks, Bitcoin has been far better. For instance, the S&P 500 has increased by 14% over the past year, while Tesla and Microsoft have risen by 37% and 21%, respectively, in the same timeframe.Interestingly, other cryptocurrencies have a similar or even better trajectory. XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has surged by a staggering 530% from around $0.57 to its current price of $3.46.

2025-07-19T10:33:52,"What Makes XYZVerse the Top Altcoin Under $1 to Pick Up Before 2026’s ‘Mega Cycle’","With the approach of 2026's anticipated crypto boom, many investors are eyeing promising digital assets priced under a dollar. XYZVerse is emerging as a standout among these affordable options. This article delves into what sets XYZVerse apart, making it a compelling choice to consider before the next major market surge. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits LUNA Classic's Comeback: Is This Crypto Underdog Worth Watching? LUNA Classic (LUNC) is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. Originally known as LUNA, it was the native token of Terra, a blockchain aiming to make global payments stable and accessible. Terra combined the reliability of traditional currencies with the openness of Bitcoin, offering quick and affordable transactions. In 2022, after a significant shake-up, the original Terra chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and LUNA became LUNA Classic. The name ""Classic"" echoes the famous split of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017, marking a new chapter for the project. Now, LUNC stands at an interesting point in the market. With its focus on stable payments and real-world use, it has the potential to attract those looking for practical solutions in crypto. While big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, there's growing interest in coins that address everyday needs. In a market that values innovation and adaptability, LUNC's story of resilience might give it an edge. It's not just about hype but offering tangible benefits. As the crypto landscape evolves, LUNA Classic could be an underdog worth keeping an eye on. Stellar Lumens: Bridging Global Finance with Blockchain Speed Stellar Lumens (XLM) is shaking up the world of finance by making money transfers quick and affordable. Since its start in 2014, Stellar has handled billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that try to replace banks, Stellar aims to connect them. Its network lets anyone send any kind of currency—whether it's dollars, euros, or even Bitcoin—across the globe in seconds. In today's fast-paced market, Stellar stands out by offering a simple way to move money without high fees or long waits. Businesses can build apps on its platform, and people can use it to send funds anywhere. With backing from the Stellar Development Foundation and initial support from Stripe, Stellar is growing and exploring new areas like smart contracts and NFTs. While other coins focus on specific niches, Stellar's goal of uniting different financial systems makes it a unique player in the digital currency scene. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators in a Decentralized Future TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based platform that aims to change how we share and consume digital content. Launched by the Tron Foundation in 2017, it started as an Ethereum-based token but soon moved to its own network. TRON's main goal is to give full ownership rights back to content creators. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large cut, TRON allows creators to earn more by connecting them directly with consumers. This means when you enjoy someone's content, you can reward them directly without middlemen. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it a competitor to platforms like Ethereum. It uses a system similar to Bitcoin's for transactions, ensuring transparency. With the growing interest in decentralized applications and the need for fair compensation for creators, TRON stands out as a promising option. In the current market, where there's a push towards decentralization and empowering individuals, TRON's focus on rewarding creators directly makes it an attractive choice. While Ethereum is still leading in dApps, TRON offers lower fees and faster transactions, which could appeal to both developers and users. Conclusion Though LUNC, XLM, and TRX are good, XYZVerse's sports-meme platform, targeting 20,000% growth, makes it the top under-$1 altcoin to pick before the mega cycle.

2025-07-19T10:20:27,"Canadian county Westlock is expected to revisit its regulations","Canadian county Westlock is expected to revisit its regulations as deliberations are ongoing to allow crypto firms to build larger facilities in the region. This new amendment to its bylaw follows a rise in proposals for high-powered facilities. According to the new amendments , the larger digital infrastructure projects will take up space and operate in the industrial zones in the county. The Data Processing Facilities Bylaw was reintroduced by the Westlock County administration at the regular council meeting on July 8. The new amendment is expected to allow digital firms to enter the region and build larger facilities in the Canadian county. Canadian county revisits Data Processing Facilities Bylaw The amendment to the bylaw, which was initially passed on April 12, 2022, was presented to the councilors by Julie McLean, the general manager for the planning and community services department at Westlock County. According to records, a data processing facility is a dedicated space that is used to house computer systems and components for the digital transactions required for processing data. It includes processing digital currency, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain transactions. This new amendment is expected to have two divisions, which the data processing facilities can be categorized into based on the amount of electrical energy required. Any proposals for larger facilities that use one megawatt or more are categorized under Major Facilities, which are only allowed to operate out of the industrial land areas. In comparison, facilities that use less than one megawatt, which are classified under Minor Facilities, can be housed anywhere, depending on the discretion of the development authority. However, the Canadian county’s law states that agricultural lands can be rezoned to become industrial land, provided there is enough need for it and people’s concerns are looked into. “Agriculture land can be rezoned to industrial land, but it requires a public hearing process for the opportunity of adjacent land owners to voice concerns and for council to decide on the land use whereas a development permit application, like if it’s a discretionary use in the AG District, then the decision is just made by the Municipal Planning Commission,” McLean said. This new development is coming after McLean reported a rise in the number of proposals for larger facilities that have been brought to the county through the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC). While the exact number remains unknown, one facility has been given the greenlight from the AUC for their power generation component use, but “they don’t have jurisdiction over the actual data processing portion of the use”, a decision that falls on the municipality. Noise pollution remains a major issue of data processing facilities One of the biggest impacts of data processing facilities still remains the noise pollution that comes with their operations. They generate a low hum noise that is annoying to residents within the surrounding areas, as well as the increase in traffic and construction noise. In section 7.21.16, a new addition would enable the development authority to request a noise mitigation plan that may include the need for a noise monitoring program. The Canadian county passed the first bylaw back in 2022 after an increase in proposals and applications for Bitcoin mining in the area. The move led to dozens of questions, concerns, and complaints from residents. County manager of planning and development Ted Traikovski told councilors at the time that his department was swamped with concerns and complaints over the Bitcoin mines. The Canadian county became one of the first to tackle the influx of bitcoin mining alongside Sturgeon County. Councilors have now carried the motion to give the bylaw a first reading and for the administration to schedule a public hearing connected to the new amendment. The Canadian county has said the hearing is expected to take place on September 9 at 9:30 AM. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-19T10:00:21,"Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent? BTC Could Fall Back To This 4H FVG","While the Bitcoin price has managed to hold close to its all-time high levels, there is still bearish pressure lurking in the background for the digital asset. With the surge to new peaks over the weekend, there have been multiple gaps created, and history suggests that Bitcoin will have to drop back down to fill these gaps before it can begin to rally again. These gaps now point to a return to its previous all-time high levels before the rally began last week. V-Shaped Pattern Shows Bears In Control Crypto analyst Youriverse explained the Bitcoin situation and why there could be a crash coming soon. First thing he pointed to was the fact that the cryptocurrency had made a V-shaped pattern after hitting its all-time high above $123,000, and this formation is usually bearish. This is because it shows a shift toward sellers being in control as profit-taking becomes more pronounced . This is only the start as more bearish developments are now in play. Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) were created on the 4-Hour chart, and one has already been filled. The first happened with the retest at $119,000 and $120,000, which eventually led to a rejection. Therefore, this leaves one more gap to be filled, and it’s the 4H FVG at its previous highs. This gives credence to the analysis and suggests that the other gaps created could be filled as well. The analyst puts the second 4H FVG just above $111,000, which coincides with the previous high turned resistance. He believes that this is what makes the level a “magnet,” especially as investors begin to take profit. Strong selling pressure could provide the added momentum needed for the price to fall toward the $111,000 level. Another major problem right now is that the Bitcoin price has formed a CME gap over the weekend, and with the retracement in price, the CME gap is looking filled at around the $114,000-$116,000 level. There has already been an attempt earlier in the week. But the $114,000 was not touched. If this CME gap is filled, then it makes it even more likely that the second FVG will be filled at $111,000. Bitcoin Price Still Shows Bullishness Although the bearishness of the gaps still looms heavy over the Bitcoin price, there is still bullishness left for the cryptocurrency. One example of this is the rising volume alongside the increase in price, suggesting that the volume is being dominated by buyers at this level. Coinglass data shows the daily volume has averaged over $100 billion this week. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is currently still in Greed, and is yet to enter the Extreme Greed territory, which is usually when a top is marked. Open interest is also sitting close to all-time high levels, which could lead to a price push before a correction.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-crash-imminent-2/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T09:59:00,"Bitcoin price flat below $120K as analysts cite early signs of altseason","Bitcoin traded mostly sideways below $120,000 throughout the day, even as broader market sentiment remained bullish. Momentum leaned toward altcoins, with several analysts pointing to signs of an emerging altseason. By late Friday, Bitcoin had pared back its weekly gains. With risk-on sentiment back in full force, the total cryptocurrency market cap briefly crossed the $4 trillion mark for the first time before easing to around $3.9 trillion at press time. Friday’s sentiment metrics pointed to a subtle but notable shift in market dynamics. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index slipped to 73, down one point, while the Altcoin Season Index rose nearly 10 points to 47. The data suggests investors may be reassessing their positions, favouring altcoins amid broader optimism. Such periods, when a growing number of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, are commonly referred to as an altseason. Will Bitcoin go up? The macro trend for Bitcoin remains intact, though its 3% drop in dominance over the past day indicates reduced short-term strength as funds flow into outperforming altcoins. Traders appear to be rotating into altcoins, many of which have posted double-digit gains in recent sessions. However, Bitcoin’s long-term structure remains bullish, supported by strong technical patterns. According to trader Merlijn, a classic bullish indicator has reappeared on the daily chart. On Thursday, he highlighted the formation of a golden cross, when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA. See below.

The most recent golden cross was confirmed on May 22, when BTC/USD traded at around $107,000. Since then, Bitcoin has gained approximately 12%. Although modest by past standards, the pattern still offers scope for further upside. Merlijn pointed out that even a short-lived golden cross, like the one seen in 2016, would project a target of around $155,000. Some analysts say Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase is laying the groundwork for the next leg up. Rekt Capital, a widely followed crypto trader, noted on Friday that a daily close above the $120,000 range high, followed by a successful retest, would confirm a breakout to new highs. Rekt Capital @rektcapital · Follow #BTC Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into AltcoinsDaily Close above ~$120k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would see Bitcoin confirm a breakout to new highs $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin 1:23 pm · 18 Jul 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Short-term hesitation aside, both technical indicators and analyst commentary suggest that Bitcoin remains positioned for further price discovery. Targets between $135,000 and $155,000 are now emerging as the next key milestones if bullish momentum resumes. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $118,000 with no gains on the weekly timeframe. Charts say altseason is here Since the low recorded on July 5, the total altcoin market cap has surged over 30%, reaching approximately $1.579 trillion by Friday, July 18. The rise comes as Bitcoin’s dominance slipped to 60.8%, its lowest level since mid-March, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market share rose to 11.2%, marking its highest dominance since late January 2025. Ethereum has led the charge among top altcoins, climbing 43% over the past 30 days. The asset was trading above $3,600 at press time, with a market cap of $437.34 billion. Analysts point to Ethereum’s recent momentum as a key signal of capital rotation out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index from CoinGlass stood at 47 on Friday, placing the market nearly halfway between Bitcoin season and altseason. While technically not yet in full altseason territory, several traders say current conditions match the start of previous altcoin-led rallies. Among them is veteran trader Peter Brandt, who declared that altseason is already underway. Peter Brandt @PeterLBrandt · Follow It’s altcoin season 3:58 am · 17 Jul 2025 3.8K Reply Copy link Read 149 replies Brandt and others have pointed to long-term breakout patterns on major altcoin indices, including TOTAL2 and TOTAL3, as evidence that the broader altcoin market is preparing for further gains. TOTAL3, which tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, recently broke out from a multi-year cup-and-handle pattern. According to trader Jelle, the setup could unfold into a move from $1.1 trillion to $1.98 trillion, which would represent gains of roughly 100%, if the breakout holds. Jelle @CryptoJelleNL · Follow #Altcoins have broken out from the multi-year cup & handle!One last hurdle to overcome, but once this clears 1.1T – everything goes nuts.Time for our patience to be rewarded.

The projected target for that breakout stands at $2.78 trillion, implying a potential 97% rally for the total altcoin market cap. Ether’s 24% gain in the past seven days has added further fuel to the rally, and analysts believe both retail and institutional investors that altcoins are poised to catch up after months of underperformance. “These six months are going to be phenomenal for Altcoins,” said Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, commenting on Ethereum’s current rally. Among the top weekly gainers, Curve DAO Token (CRV) rallied 47.59%, followed by Bonk (BONK) with a 44.49% gain, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) up 40.86%. Source: CoinMarketCap.
