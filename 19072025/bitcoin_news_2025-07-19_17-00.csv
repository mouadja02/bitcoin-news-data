2025-07-19T14:57:10,"Russian government readies tougher rules for miners","Russia is preparing to impose new restrictions on cryptocurrency miners, including stricter punishments for violating existing bans and illegal mining activities. One of the proposed measures will allow authorities to remotely disconnect crypto mining facilities from the grid during periods when demand for electricity is at its highest. Russian government readies tougher rules for miners The Ministry of Energy in Russia has been tasked to finalize regulations for those involved in the extraction of digital currencies, the Interfax news agency reported, following a recent meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers in Moscow. According to a report issued after the meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, the updated rules include introducing greater liability for illegal connection to distribution networks, electricity theft, and violation of imposed mining bans. Furthermore, crypto miners will be added to a new category of consumers of lesser importance, for which the reliability of power supply is far from guaranteed. The energy ministry is now expected to develop ‚Äúa mechanism for redistributing the released capacity when limiting mining activities in a region in order to connect socially significant consumers to the power grid,‚Äù the document detailed. Russia wants to unplug mining farms remotely The Russian government explained that the establishment of the new ‚Äúfourth‚Äù consumer category actually means having the option to ‚Äúintroduce remote restrictions on consumption during peak loads and under threat of energy and capacity shortages.‚Äù Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining in 2024 to exploit its competitive advantages, such as cheap and abundant energy. But Moscow was caught unprepared for how quickly miners managed to turn energy surpluses into shortages, prompting Putin to comment: ‚ÄúWe were happy we had electricity surpluses in some regions. But they began mining there ‚Ä¶ We had to make certain decisions.‚Äù Speaking at an economic forum this month, the Russian President justified the mining restrictions introduced in certain parts of the country that have been facing increasing power deficits as a result of the rapid growth of the mining industry. In the past few months, mining has been partially or fully banned in a dozen energy-deficient regions, from Siberia to the North Caucasus, and even in occupied Ukraine. Initial temporary restrictions have been expanded to 6-year prohibitions, in some cases. Among other proposals discussed at the government meeting is the idea to introduce mandatory labeling and certification for foreign mining equipment imported into the Russian Federation, the crypto news outlet Bits.media noted in a post on Friday. It comes after Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko unveiled that his department has joined forces with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development to establish a special register for devices used for digital minting. In early July, the official stated: ‚ÄúThe register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs.‚Äù The revised regulations must be submitted for government approval by the end of the current quarter. Then, federal and local authorities will begin their gradual implementation in regions with active restrictions on the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Elsewhere, both companies and individual entrepreneurs are allowed to mine as long as they register with the tax authority, but less than a third of mining enterprises have done that. The registration is not mandatory for amateur miners burning less than 6,000 kWh monthly. Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other agencies have been busting illegal crypto farms across the country to limit financial losses for the state and utilities. In June, the Rosseti grid operator said it‚Äôs working with telecom companies to hunt down illegal miners by tracking their internet traffic.

The New York-based company has acquired 29,899 TAO tokens at an average price of $334 each, according a press release . It plans to stake the tokens within the Bittensor network, which rewards participants for contributing to the development of AI models. The company‚Äôs bet on TAO, rather than on other cryptocurrencies more popular for corporate treasuries, rests on its ‚Äúexpected continued growth and expansion of¬†decentralized¬†AI,‚Äù according to the company‚Äôs executive chairman Joshua Silverman. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are the most commonly chosen for corporate treasuries.

2025-07-19T14:30:09,"Crypto Lawyer Argues GENIUS Act Sets The Stage For DeFi Expansion","In a historic move for the digital asset industry, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, marking the first major federal legislation governing cryptocurrency. The bill, which passed the Senate last month and was approved by the House of Representatives on Thursday with bipartisan support, introduces a comprehensive framework for regulated stablecoins backed by the US dollar. The law is widely seen as a turning point for the crypto space, offering long-awaited legal clarity for stablecoin issuers and reinforcing the dollar‚Äôs role in the emerging digital economy. Industry leaders and lawmakers alike hailed the move as a major win for innovation and financial modernization. By encouraging the development of fully reserved, off-chain backed stablecoins, the GENIUS Act aims to provide a safe and transparent on-ramp for users and institutions alike. Experts believe the legislation will drive further adoption of dollar-based digital payments while laying the groundwork for on-chain financial infrastructure to flourish. With the regulatory green light now in place, many expect accelerated growth in the US crypto sector, starting with stablecoins but expanding far beyond. This marks a pivotal moment in America‚Äôs positioning as a global leader in digital finance. DeFi Stands To Benefit As GENIUS Act Unlocks On-Chain Growth Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, a prominent crypto-focused venture capital firm, recently offered an insightful take on the implications of the GENIUS Act. While the legislation itself is not aimed at decentralized finance (DeFi), Chervinsky noted that its impact on DeFi could be substantial. ‚ÄúThe GENIUS Act isn‚Äôt directly about DeFi ‚Äî it regulates centralized stablecoins with full reserves off-chain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it is very good for DeFi ‚Äî the more dollars and people there are onchain, the more need there will be for on-chain finance of all kinds.‚Äù This perspective highlights a broader trend: regulation that encourages safer, more transparent stablecoins could lead to an influx of capital and users into the crypto ecosystem. With more regulated digital dollars flowing on-chain, the infrastructure supporting lending, trading, and yield generation in DeFi stands to grow significantly. Chervinsky‚Äôs point about payments being ‚Äújust a gateway‚Äù reinforces the idea that once users begin transacting on-chain with stablecoins, the leap into more advanced financial tools becomes much more natural. As Bitcoin hovers above $117,000 and Ethereum reclaims the $3,500 level, these legal developments are adding fuel to an already bullish environment. The coming weeks may prove decisive as both BTC and ETH test new levels, backed by increasing institutional interest and a favorable policy shift in Washington. Crypto Market Surges To Multi-Year Resistance The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2) has broken out sharply, climbing to $1.45 trillion on strong volume. This marks an 11.58% gain in the past week and brings the market to levels not seen since early 2024. The move confirms renewed interest in altcoins, particularly Ethereum, which has led the charge with a 131% rally since April. Price action on the weekly chart shows a clean break above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages ($1.13T and $987B), with bullish momentum accelerating. The 200-week moving average at $879 billion provided strong long-term support throughout the recent consolidation phase, setting the stage for this breakout. This rally now targets the next major resistance zone around the $1.6‚Äì$1.7 trillion mark, where the market last peaked before a sharp correction. Volume has surged, supporting the strength of the breakout and suggesting institutional inflows may be returning. If TOTAL2 can maintain this momentum, the altcoin market could see a broader rotation and rally. Still, investors should watch closely for potential profit-taking or retracements, especially near key resistance. A weekly close above $1.5 trillion would further solidify the bullish structure and open the door for new cycle highs across major altcoins.

2025-07-19T14:19:02,"ETH Treasuries Ditch ‚ÄòDigital Gold‚Äô Model for Yield-Generating Staking: Here‚Äôs Why It Matters","Michael Saylor‚Äôs bold ‚Äúfinancial engineering‚Äù at Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to amass significant Bitcoin holdings has sparked a trend among corporations. Over 50 firms have already adopted a similar BTC-focused treasury strategy. However, a new segment of companies is emerging, seeking not only crypto exposure but also aligning directly with Ethereum‚Äôs economic ecosystem. At first glance, the sharp price swings seen in Ethereum treasury stocks might look like speculative rollercoasters similar to meme coins. But the approaches taken by this initial wave of ETH treasury firms differ at a fundamental level. Inside the First ETH Treasury Wave According to Galaxy Digital, these firms are moving beyond hype-driven or passive crypto exposure and are instead actively using Ethereum as a productive reserve asset by staking for yield or leveraging advanced DeFi strategies. This approach sets them apart from Bitcoin treasury adopters, who often took a passive ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù stance financed by leverage-heavy convertible debt. Meanwhile, ETH treasury companies like SharpLink, BitMine, Bit Digital, and GameSquare have chosen to fund their strategies with equity, thereby avoiding the structural vulnerabilities linked to debt obligations and looming maturities. Galaxy Digital also said that the capital held by these firms is actively deployed rather than sitting idle. Through ETH staking, they boost validator security and protocol stability across the network. In cases like GameSquare, treasury funds are also used for DeFi-native yield strategies, which support liquidity pools, lending platforms, and other essential Ethereum infrastructure. Despite the ongoing risks of dilution, smart contract exposure, and price swings, investors can use dilution impact assessments and premium-to-book valuations to gauge both the downside and potential income-based upside. This wave of ETH treasuries appears to be a more actively engaged and capital-efficient model. Firms Scale Ethereum Holdings This month, the Nasdaq-listed online tech firm SharpLink made a significant Ethereum acquisition and became the largest corporate holder of ETH to date. From July 7 to July 13, the company bought around 74,656 ETH at an average price of $2,852, which is roughly worth $213 million. With this purchase, SharpLink‚Äôs total Ethereum holdings have grown to approximately 280,706 ETH. Las Vegas-based BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million via a private placement of 55.6 million shares at $4.50 each on June 30 to grow its Ethereum treasury. The raise added 81,380 ETH to its balance sheet and increased total holdings to 163,000 ETH while expanding its share count by 13x. New York-based Bit Digital raised $172 million in June after selling 280 BTC to build its Ethereum treasury under CEO Sam Tabar. By March 31, it held 24,434 ETH, out of which it staked 21,568 ETH with a 3.2% average yield in 2024, and completed its pivot to an ETH staking and treasury model. Texas-based GameSquare Holdings raised $8 million in July via a follow-on equity offering and partnered with Dialectic to launch an Ethereum treasury program targeting 8-14% yields. The company made its first crypto move by purchasing $5 million in ETH.

2025-07-19T14:16:35,"Tether drives crypto adoption across regions","Tether USDT, the world‚Äôs most liquid stablecoin, has established itself as a powerhouse in the crypto arena. Recent data analytics indicate that USDT commands 73% of stablecoin activities. Data shared on X underscores USDT‚Äôs deep integ ration into the daily fl ow o f digital currency transactions worldwide. Stablecoins like USDT are digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies‚Äîmost commonly the US dollar‚Äîallowing users to transfer, store, and receive value without exposure to the extreme volatility typical of cryptocurrencies. One hundred sixty-five¬†million on-chain wallets are holding¬†USDT. Millions more are estimated to have USDT in centralized exchanges. Active stablecoin wallets have grown by over 50% over the past 12 months, from 19.6 million to 30 million. A substantial growth can be credited to Tether, which remains the market leader in user adoption, reach, and trading activity. Tether drives crypto adoption across regions USDT is more than a digital dollar; it is a new financial tool for everyone worldwide. Tether estimates that consumption in Asia is particularly high, with USDT representing approximately 45% of global volume . Local banking in some areas may be less established, or some countries may see high currency volatility, in which case USDT could be a good solution. Tether‚Äôs sway also runs heavily into the world of crypto trading. According to data from major exchanges, 65% of all trades with stablecoins involve USDT. It is a base currency of more than 900 trading pairs, including those from the major centralized exchanges, such as KuCoin and MEXC, meaning that ASTA has the largest number of trading pairs available in the market. Pairs such as USDT/BTC and USDT/ETH are some of the most active in the world, responsible for over 35% of all trading volume worldwide. Tether faces scrutiny while shaping the stablecoin future As much as it is in a leadership position, Tether has not been scandal-free. USDT reserves have been criticized for opacity by critics and regulators. In 2021, the United States‚Äô Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed to settle with Tether after making similar claims about the backing of the currency, inviting renewed attention around the asset that is best known for being used to devalue the USD in Bitcoin markets. Tether has since made greater efforts to become more transparent. It currently issues quarterly attestation reports that independent firms audit. Tether reached an all-time high of total exposure in the US Treasuries, approaching $120 billion, including Treasuries‚Äô indirect exposures from Money Market Funds and reverse repo agreements. That leaves it with a reserve of $5.6 billion to carry it into next year, and it‚Äôs hard to argue that it is not in robust financial health. Still, regulatory pressure is growing. In the United States, proposed legislation like the STABLE Act seeks to increase scrutiny of stablecoin issuers. But critics say that rather than acting as a Trojan horse for innovation, if not carefully crafted, those laws could stifle it or fail to consider the dynamics of decentralization or global usage, punishing major players like Tether more than smaller ones. Competitors such as Circle‚Äôs USDC and MakerDAO‚Äôs DAI have a smaller market share, but have continued to steal a chunk of the market. Neither, however, has approached Tether‚Äôs size, reach, or application as a trading tool. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Recently, India‚Äôs leading exchanges have reported a sharp rise in interest from Indian family offices, amidst the ongoing global bull run. Bitcoin‚Äôs Rise Fuels Confidence The wealthy Indian investors are quietly shifting their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The trend has shifted, especially after Trump‚Äôs return to the White House, which has boosted global crypto confidence. With Bitcoin hitting above $120K and giving 90% returns in a year, crypto is now looking a lot more attractive than gold, stocks or bonds. HNI Activity Spikes Across Top Crypto Platforms A recent report from Moneycontrol reveals that platforms like Mudrex saw HNI trading volumes rise by 30% in just one week, hitting the $10 million mark. CoinDCX‚Äôs average HNI trade size grew by around 25‚Äì30% in July. Between January and June, around 3,500 HNIs, family offices, and institutional investors accounted for nearly half of all trading on CoinDCX. Their average monthly spot trading volume now exceeds ‚Çπ50 lakh. A Clear Shift In Mindset Most wealthy investors are leaning toward blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Tokens like Solana and XRP are also gaining traction. CoinSwitch co-founder Ashish Singhal notes that Indian HNIs are no longer just exploring crypto; they are diving in. The mindset has shifted from ‚ÄòWhy crypto?‚Äô to ‚ÄòHow much and where to invest?‚Äô Retail Investors Driving The Momentum Although HNI trades are growing, retail investors are driving the real momentum. Daily trading volumes have jumped sharply across major platforms. CoinSwitch saw a 3x jump in daily trading while CoinDCX‚Äôs daily volume rose 40% in July to $12.82 million. Mudrex saw spot trading jump by 102% and futures trading rise by 200% within just one week. Interestingly, over half of this came from meme coins like Doge, PEPE, and Shiba Inu, while the rest came from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple. ZebPay saw 60% of trades towards the buy side. Many retail investors are entering or returning to the market, expecting more gains, while some are cashing out profits. Major Obstacles But India‚Äôs high taxes and uncertain regulations are still major obstacles that are pushing retail investors away. Experts note that simpler rules and better tax policies could drive even more interest. Bitcoin‚Äôs explosive price rally sparked a lot of interest in India. Around $150‚Äì200 million was invested in just one week. Major activity took place between July 10‚Äì15, when Bitcoin crossed $116K. Experts predict that it could reach $140K‚Äì$185K by the end of the year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/indias-wealthy-investors-are-choosing-crypto-over-stocks-and-gold/,"BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|ETH","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
