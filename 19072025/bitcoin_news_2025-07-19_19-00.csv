The ITRC says 1,732 data compromises were reported in the US in H1 2025, which impacted 165,745,452 individuals. “Analysis of data from the first six months of the year reveals a landscape dominated by cyberattacks, with supply chain vulnerabilities persisting as a major threat vector. While the total number of compromises has not dramatically outpaced previous years, the impact on victims remains severe.” Source: ID Theft Center There are currently around 342 million people in the US, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . The ITRC says there’s been a rise in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered phishing attacks, which are more difficult to detect, and other new threats to personal information. “The introduction of repackaged and recirculated personal information – PCD (previously compromised data) – into the risk environment represents a significant new threat to organizations that are vulnerable to the use of stolen logins and passwords to gain access to mission-critical systems for ransom attacks and/or data exfiltration. The recent discovery of an unsecured cloud environment with more than 16 billion logins and passwords aggregated into a single database is an example of PCD.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-19T16:48:35,"Woman Receives $501,450,311 in Bank Account, Tells Authorities She Doesn’t Know Where It Came From – Now She’s Facing Prison: Report","A 58-year-old woman is awaiting prison after receiving over half a billion dollars in mysterious and unexplained funds in her bank account. Authorities say Zin Nwe Nyunt of Singapore set up a wholesale trading firm, and after the company’s accounts received SGD $640.7 million – about $500 million – she stated she had no idea where it came from, The Straits Times reports . Her trading firm, called Unione Pte Ltd, set up bank accounts with Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), United Overseas Bank (UOB) and DBS. She then received large sums of money via wire transfer between 2020 and 2021, court proceedings show. Nyunt first hit the police’s radar when an Australian investment scam victim provided information that led investigators to Unione’s bank account in 2021, which received $1.8 million in proceeds from the scheme. Court proceedings revealed a friend of Nyunt’s husband, Nyan Win, was approached by a Myanmar national named Ko Phillip, who asked him if he wanted to assist him in his commodities trading business by receiving wire transfers to a Singaporean business account. The deal was that Win would be paid 0.5 Myanmar kyat – a small fraction of a cent – for every US$1 received. However, Win decided it was too risky for him to receive money to his company’s bank account, and instead referred the alleged “opportunity” to Nyunt’s husband. In what appears to be an elaborate money laundering operation for scams, neither Nyunt nor Nyan were ever aware of the source of the funds, but each admitted to receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in “commissions.” Nyunt will begin serving an 18 month prison sentence in August while Nyan is expected to be sentenced at the end of this month.

2025-07-19T16:30:44,"Pundit to XRP Holders: When BlackRock Comes in, You Will Be Glad You Have 1 XRP","Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto pundit on X, recently addressed the XRP Army, stating that all XRP holders, including those holding only 1 XRP, will be glad when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, gets involved with the digital asset. The comment alludes to the growing anticipation that institutional finance giants will soon recognize XRP’s utility and position in global finance. Many retail investors have accumulated XRP with expectations that its price will one day reflect the real-world use cases it enables. However, the notion that even holding one XRP might eventually be significant shows a belief in extreme long-term appreciation, potentially driven by institutional adoption. If you hold 1 XRP or 1,000 XRP Understand that you understand what XRP is. When Blackrock come in, you will be glad you have 1 XRP — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 19, 2025 Institutional Entry Could Signal a Turning Point Bale’s post plays into a broader conversation among XRP supporters who believe that traditional finance is quietly preparing to integrate XRP into future infrastructure. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently predicted that XRP is on the cusp of mass institutional adoption , and BlackRock’s involvement with Bitcoin through ETFs shows that the firm is interested in cryptocurrencies. Its entrance into the XRP market would signal institutional validation that could change the market landscape entirely. Such involvement would carry more than just symbolic weight, as BlackRock manages trillions in assets. Anticipation for a BlackRock XRP ETF has been building for years, and such a product would introduce XRP to a wider investor base, bring major capital inflows, boost liquidity, and give the asset a level of credibility retail investors cannot provide on their own. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Holding At Least 1 XRP Is Important Prominent voices in the crypto space, such as Edoardo Farina, have constantly advised investors to hold up to 10,000 XRP. He opined that the amount may soon be impossible for average investors . However, Bale suggests that holding just one token could be life-changing. A growing number of XRP advocates believe that in a future where demand for XRP surges, individual holders could lend out their tokens to institutions , generating passive income from them. XRP has a fixed supply. As more tokens are burned and supply diminishes, the asset will become more valuable. As the supply shrinks, institutions that need to use the asset will have to depend on retail investors who purchased early. If a player like BlackRock does enter, Bale’s post may age well, and even the smallest holders could find themselves in a strong position.

The news sent Block’s shares soaring 8.5% in after-hours trading. After closing Friday’s session up 2.95%. Inclusion in the index means Block shares will appear in portfolios run by mutual funds and institutional managers following the S&P 500, the stock market’s benchmark index. Earlier this year, Coinbase (COIN) became the first cryptocurrency firm to join the index and at the time its shares saw a similar jump. Earlier this week, COIN hit a new all-time high around $445 before correcting. Block is best known for its Cash App and Square, as well as its ongoing integration of Bitcoin into its business model. The company piloted real-time bitcoin payments earlier this year and is looking to roll out the feature broadly next year.

2025-07-19T16:00:55,"Why Bitcoin Price Failed To Break $123,000 In The Past Week — Analyst Explains","The crypto market was a story of two distinct halves, one of which saw the Bitcoin price soar to multiple all-time highs. After reaching its all-time high of around $122,800, the premier cryptocurrency has succumbed to a sobering wave of bearish pressure in the past few days. This recent wave of downward pressure was precipitated by the movement of a Satoshi-era whale on Thursday, July 17. However, the Bitcoin price never seemed likely to cross the $123,000 level, and a prominent on-chain expert on X has explained why. Is The Move To $143,000 Still Possible? In a recent post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson explained why the price of BTC failed to break the $123,000 level during its rally to a new all-time high in the past week. According to the crypto expert, this seeming loss of momentum could spell danger for the market leader in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In – Sign Of Rally Exhaustion? The rationale behind this prediction is that the $123,000 region (or more precisely, $123,370) is the second Alpha Price level for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Alpha Price is a powerful on-chain indicator that uses several key metrics to estimate where the BTC price is likely to find support or resistance. In essence, the Alpha Price is a level that the price of Bitcoin needs to breach and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. “It begins by calculating the market’s age in days and uses that to derive the average market cap—essentially the historical valuation baseline,” Wedson added about the indicator. As shown in the chart above, the Alpha Price indicator has multiple threshold levels, which behave like pressure regions. These thresholds reflect zones where investor sentiment is likely to shift; lower levels act as supports because investors often buy to defend their positions, while upper levels signal increased selling pressure due to profit taking. Wedson noted that the Bitcoin price failing to breach the second Alpha Price level doesn’t imply that the market top is in. However, the $123,370 region is a clear resistance zone, and the BTC price might need to face some pullback before climbing to new highs. Wedson also mentioned that the Alpha Price level will update on Saturday, July 19, as it’s dynamically adjusted based on real-time on-chain transaction flows. Nevertheless, if the Bitcoin price does break this level, a move to above $143,000 could still be on the cards. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,610, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Whales?

2025-07-19T16:00:16,"SEC Chair Signals Openness To Including Crypto Investments In Retirement Plan — Details","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins has indicated openness to allow crypto investments in retirement plans. This comes days after a report emerged about United States President Donald Trump’s plans to open the retirement market to other alternative investments, including digital assets, gold, and private equity. This report revealed that the initiative is expected to become a reality through a Presidential executive order as early as this week. This move would allow the diversification of investment options available within US retirement 401(k) plans, which have been primarily limited to stocks and bonds over the years. Disclosure Still Important For Crypto Inclusion In 401(k) Plans A 401(k) plan is a workplace savings plan that allows an individual to contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts where it can be invested and withdrawn at a future date — typically after retirement. In a Bloomberg interview on Friday, July 18, Atkins signaled openness to allowing cryptocurrencies into 401(k) plans for retired Americans. However, the Commission’s leader highlighted the need for responsible disclosure and education on risks associated with investing in digital assets. Atkins said about the move: We have to do it carefully, because the private markets are a lot different from the public markets. Disclosure is key, and people need to know what they are getting into. However, we need to address it because there is a demand out there for this sort of products. If Trump does sign an executive order allowing crypto investments in American retirement plans, it would represent another one in the host of pro-crypto actions taken by the US president since taking the Oval Office in January. On Friday, Trump signed the landmark crypto bill “GENIUS” into law. This GENIUS act represents a stride in the right direction for clearer regulations for the crypto industry, as the legislation is aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. SEC Exploring Innovation Exception To Boost Tokenization In the interview, Atkins also mentioned that the SEC is considering setting up an innovation exemption within its regulatory framework to foster tokenization. As Bitcoinist earlier reported, this change would allow new trading techniques and support the development of a tokenized securities ecosystem. Atkins is becoming increasingly popular amongst the crypto crowd due to his pro-crypto stance, which is the stark opposite of his predecessor, Gary Gensler.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-openness-to-including-crypto-in-retirement-plan/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|US President Donald Trump",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T16:00:00,"Will XRP Price Hit $10 in 2025?","The post Will XRP Price Hit $10 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is back in the spotlight as excitement grows around its future. With talks of a possible XRP ETF, Ripple’s IPO, and the end of its battle with the SEC , many wonder if XRP could reach $10 or more this year. In a new video , crypto analyst VirtualBacon breaks down what’s really happening, what’s driving the buzz, and where XRP could be headed next. XRP Beats Bitcoin in Online Searches He points out that XRP has now become the most searched crypto on both Google and YouTube, even more than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This shows a big jump in interest from the public. Many people are curious about what’s next for XRP, which could be a sign of growing momentum before a major move. According to crypto analyst Kyle Chassé, XRP is set for a major breakout. XRP has already outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits, without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or DeFi yield. What’s Brewing Inside? A recent report from the CME Group, a big name in traditional finance, gives XRP some serious credit. It confirms XRP’s price moves are just as active as other big cryptos like Ethereum and Solana, but what’s more important is that XRP doesn’t move in sync with Bitcoin or the stock market. That makes it stand out. For big investors looking for variety in their portfolios, XRP now looks more attractive. The report also touches on XRP’s controversial token supply. But according to the analyst, Ripple is following its plan to release tokens slowly over the next 10 to 13 years. As long as they stick to this, the supply won’t flood the market. This gives investors more confidence that XRP’s price won’t be dragged down by unexpected token releases. Can XRP Hit $10 This Year? However, Analyst gives a realistic price target of $4.50 to $5 by the end of this year, assuming Bitcoin hits $140K . He says this is very possible if XRP continues to gain attention and if Bitcoin starts its next big rally. As for $10, it’s not impossible, but it may only happen later in the cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will XRP Price Hit $4 After Ripple vs SEC Officially Ends? , Why $20 XRP Is Unrealistic This Cycle While some XRP supporters dream of a $20 price tag, Analyst strongly warns against such expectations. He explains that during the 2017 bull run, when XRP reached its all-time high , there were far fewer competing altcoins in the market. Today, XRP faces competition from Solana, BNB, Cardano, AI, and gaming tokens, and even stablecoins. For XRP to reach $20, it would need to reclaim a 23% market dominance, the level it had in 2017. Given the explosion of crypto sectors and narratives, this is nearly impossible in today’s market structure. Overall he emphasizes that while a momentary kick to $20 during peak euphoria is possible, such a price wouldn’t be sustainable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-19T15:59:00,"After Making $114M Riding Bitcoin to Record Highs, Trader Rotates to EVM Layer-2 Crypto Set to Move from Under $0.002 to $0.20","After pocketing $114 million by entering Bitcoin near its 2022 bottom and riding it to a record-breaking high, one of crypto’s sharpest traders has made a decisive new move, into a low-cap EVM Layer-2 token quietly gaining serious traction, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Currently priced at $0.0014 in Stage 5 of its presale, the project is up 40% from its initial stage. Already 2.14x below its confirmed listing price of $0.003, the upside is baked in. Over $5.9 million has been raised and 4.8 billion tokens sold out. Analysts watching this trend closely suggest post-listing moves toward even $0.20. Stage 4 sold out at speed, and Stage 5 is following suit. Timing here could be everything. From Peak to Pivot: Bitcoin’s Role in the Rotation Bitcoin is currently trading above $118,700, having recently reached a new all-time high amid continued ETF inflows and broad macro support. For some early investors, including the trader who reportedly entered around the $16,000 level in late 2022, this marks a full market cycle, turning strategic accumulation into a realized gain of over $114 million. Now, instead of doubling down, that capital is rotating into higher-upside opportunities with favorable tokenomics and early-stage momentum. The move toward Little Pepe, an EVM-based Layer-2 asset currently in Stage 5 of its presale, highlights a broader trend, using profits from mature assets like BTC to seek exponential returns elsewhere. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Presale Stage 5 in Full Swing Stage 5 of the Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale is now live, and interest continues to climb. Built on a Layer 2 network focused on digital community culture, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers fast transactions, low fees, and a unique Launchpad designed to back emerging, community-driven tokens.

Anyone who contributes $100 or more during the presale and completes a few simple steps is eligible to win one of ten prizes, each worth $77,000 in tokens. Meanwhile, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has secured high-ranking positions on CoinMarketCap, reflecting the growing attention it’s receiving. Further strengthening its reputation, the project recently passed a smart contract audit from Freshcoin.io with a score of 81.55/100. With Stage 4 completed ahead of schedule and the price still holding at $0.0014, interest continues to grow. Strong Progress as Stage 5 Accelerates Momentum hasn’t slowed, Stage 5 is advancing quickly. Investor activity is rising, key listings are on the way, and the ongoing giveaway continues to bring in new backers. After turning a $16K Bitcoin (BTC) entry into $114 million, one of crypto’s most successful traders is shifting focus to the next big opportunity, Little Pepe (LILPEPE). This EVM Layer-2 token, now in Stage 5 of its presale at just $0.0014, is catching serious attention with over $5.9 million raised and 4.8 billion tokens sold. The confirmed listing price of $0.003 guarantees an instant 2.14x return, but top analysts are already forecasting post-launch targets as high as $0.02, a staggering 100,000% upside. Backed by rapid community growth, a $777,000 giveaway, and a successful audit, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly becoming the go-to for early-stage, high-upside exposure.
