2025-07-30T21:40:10,"Spot Solana ETF: 21Shares‚Äô Bold Move Towards Mainstream Adoption","BitcoinWorld Spot Solana ETF: 21Shares‚Äô Bold Move Towards Mainstream Adoption The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation as institutional interest continues to surge, particularly around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A significant development recently emerged that has piqued the curiosity of investors and enthusiasts alike: 21Shares has submitted an updated S-1 application for its proposed Spot Solana ETF . This move, initially highlighted by Solid Intel on X, marks a pivotal moment for the Solana ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. What exactly does this updated filing mean, and why is it drawing so much attention? Understanding the Significance of a Spot Solana ETF Before diving into the specifics of 21Shares‚Äô filing, let‚Äôs clarify what a Spot Solana ETF entails. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts for an asset, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset ‚Äì in this case, Solana (SOL). This direct exposure is often preferred by investors because it more accurately reflects the real-time market price of the asset, minimizing tracking errors associated with futures contracts. The introduction of a spot ETF for a cryptocurrency like Solana is monumental for several reasons: Accessibility: It allows traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange. This simplifies the investment process, removing complexities like setting up wallets, managing private keys, or navigating unfamiliar platforms. Regulatory Clarity: An ETF operates within a regulated framework, providing a layer of investor protection and legitimacy that some traditional investors seek. It brings Solana into the familiar and trusted structure of traditional finance. Liquidity: ETFs typically trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling throughout the trading day. Institutional Adoption: The approval of a Spot Solana ETF would signal growing acceptance and maturity of the crypto market by regulatory bodies, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital to flow into Solana and other altcoins. Why is 21Shares‚Äô Updated Filing a Game-Changer? 21Shares, a prominent issuer of cryptocurrency ETPs (Exchange Traded Products), has been at the forefront of bringing digital assets to traditional financial markets. Their updated S-1 filing for a Spot Solana ETF is not just a routine procedural step; it reflects persistent efforts and a strategic vision to broaden the reach of cryptocurrencies. This isn‚Äôt their first rodeo; 21Shares, in partnership with ARK Invest, has also been a key player in the Bitcoin spot ETF race, eventually seeing their ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF approved. The fact that 21Shares is pushing forward with Solana, a blockchain known for its high throughput and scalability, indicates a belief in SOL‚Äôs long-term potential and its growing ecosystem. The updated S-1 application typically involves addressing previous regulatory feedback, refining disclosures, and providing more comprehensive information to meet the stringent requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This persistence sends a strong signal to the market: issuers are confident that, eventually, a Spot Solana ETF will gain approval, following in the footsteps of Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum ETFs. It shows a commitment to navigating the complex regulatory landscape to bring innovative investment products to market. What Challenges Lie Ahead for a Spot Solana ETF? While the prospect of a Spot Solana ETF is exciting, the path to approval is rarely straightforward. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto ETFs, particularly those directly holding volatile assets. Several challenges need to be overcome: Market Manipulation Concerns: A primary concern for regulators is the potential for market manipulation in the underlying spot market for Solana. The SEC requires robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size related to the underlying asset. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of large amounts of SOL by a regulated entity is paramount. This involves robust security protocols and insurance. Valuation: Establishing a reliable and consistent method for valuing SOL, given its decentralized nature and trading across various exchanges, is crucial. Regulatory Precedent: While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have set precedents, each cryptocurrency presents unique characteristics and regulatory considerations. Solana‚Äôs distinct technical architecture and ecosystem might introduce new questions for regulators. The updated filing by 21Shares suggests they are actively working to address these concerns, providing more detailed plans for custody, valuation, and market surveillance. How Might a Spot Solana ETF Impact the Solana Ecosystem? The approval and launch of a Spot Solana ETF could have profound effects on the Solana ecosystem: Price Appreciation: Increased demand from institutional investors and traditional retail investors could lead to a significant price surge for SOL. Enhanced Legitimacy: An ETF approval would bolster Solana‚Äôs reputation as a legitimate and investable asset class, attracting more developers, projects, and users to its blockchain. Improved Liquidity: The influx of capital through an ETF could further deepen the liquidity of the SOL market. Broader Adoption: As more investors gain exposure, it could indirectly boost awareness and adoption of Solana‚Äôs dApps and services. However, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential volatility. Initial excitement might lead to price pumps, but long-term price stability will depend on fundamental adoption and market dynamics. Comparing Solana‚Äôs ETF Journey to Bitcoin and Ethereum Solana‚Äôs journey towards a spot ETF mirrors, in many ways, the arduous paths taken by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin, the pioneer, faced years of rejections before its spot ETFs were finally approved in January 2024. Ethereum‚Äôs spot ETF applications are currently under review, with many anticipating a decision later this year. The regulatory landscape is evolving, and the SEC‚Äôs stance appears to be softening, particularly after the Grayscale victory and the subsequent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Solana, as a prominent Layer 1 blockchain, stands as a strong contender to follow suit. Its market capitalization, developer activity, and growing institutional interest position it well for such a product. The successful launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs has undoubtedly created a template and potentially a more favorable environment for other crypto asset ETFs. What‚Äôs Next for the Spot Solana ETF? The updated S-1 filing is a crucial step, but it‚Äôs part of a longer process. The SEC will review the updated application, potentially issue further comments, and eventually make a decision. This process can take months, involving multiple rounds of revisions and discussions between the issuer and the regulator. Market participants will be closely watching for any further updates, particularly any indications from the SEC regarding their timeline or specific concerns. For investors, this development highlights the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing avenues for traditional investment. While direct investment in SOL remains an option, a Spot Solana ETF would offer a regulated, familiar, and potentially less intimidating entry point for a broader range of investors. In conclusion, 21Shares‚Äô updated S-1 filing for a Spot Solana ETF is more than just a piece of paperwork; it‚Äôs a testament to the persistent drive to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. While challenges remain, the continued progress signals a future where Solana, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, could become a staple in diversified investment portfolios, accessible through the familiar structure of an ETF. This bold move could indeed usher in a new era of institutional engagement for Solana, fundamentally reshaping its market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Spot Solana ETF? A Spot Solana ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Solana (SOL) as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL‚Äôs price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. How does a Spot Solana ETF differ from a futures ETF? A Spot Solana ETF holds actual SOL tokens, aiming to track the real-time market price. A futures ETF, on the other hand, holds futures contracts on Solana, which are agreements to buy or sell SOL at a predetermined price in the future. Spot ETFs generally offer more direct price exposure. Why is 21Shares‚Äô updated filing significant? 21Shares is a major ETP issuer, and their persistent efforts with an updated S-1 filing indicate strong commitment and belief in the potential approval of a Spot Solana ETF. It signals their active engagement with regulators to meet requirements and bring this product to market. What are the potential benefits of a Spot Solana ETF for investors? Benefits include easier access to Solana for traditional investors, enhanced regulatory oversight and investor protection, increased liquidity, and potential for broader institutional adoption, which could lead to greater market stability and growth for SOL. What challenges might a Spot Solana ETF face before approval? Key challenges include addressing regulatory concerns around market manipulation in the underlying spot market, ensuring secure custody of SOL, establishing reliable valuation methods, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for novel crypto products. When could a Spot Solana ETF potentially be approved? The timeline for approval is uncertain and depends on SEC review, issuer responses, and broader regulatory sentiment. While Bitcoin ETFs were approved after years, and Ethereum ETFs are pending, each asset is reviewed individually. It could take several months to a year or more.

Liquidations spiked to over $200 million in an hour across all digital assets as bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $116,000 while Powell spoke, CoinGlass data shows.

The two bourses separately submitted rule change proposals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that, if ratified, would allow eligible crypto ETFs to list without separate SEC approvals. Exchanges now must file a 19b-4 form on each new crypto ETF, usually starting a months-long review process. The new proposal would exclude funds that meet specific criteria from this filing requirement . ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted the news on social media, describing the rule change as streamlining the process for approving crypto ETFs and ‚Äúmake the system more efficient and scalable.‚Äù Ensuring Crypto Aligns With Traditional Fund Structures The timing of the filings is noteworthy. The SEC just approved in-kind creation and redemptions for crypto ETFs yesterday ‚Äî a step that aligns the operational dynamics of crypto funds with those of standard ETFs. The change will boost institutional interest and could lower investors‚Äô costs by simplifying fund inflows and outflows. White House Advances Broader Crypto Policy On the same day that the exchange filings were made, a broad proposal was released by the White House through the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Assets. The 168-page report calls for the harmonization of crypto regulations with traditional finance and eliminating delays that hinder innovation. Some of the important proposals include federal regulations on custody of crypto assets, trading, and registration being made clearer and coordination between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Legislative Momentum Builds The regulatory momentum follows a series of crypto-targeted bills. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, opening the door to stablecoin regulation. The House recently passed both the CLARITY Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, with Senate consideration anticipated after the August recess.

According to Cboe‚Äôs filing dated July 28, 2025, the product offered as Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF was requested to be listed and traded under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). According to the filing, the ETF's legal structure is structured around a trust fund established in Delaware on June 12, 2025, that will operate as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. The fund has no fixed expiration date. The ETF's sponsor will be Invesco Capital Management LLC. The filing states that the ETF will be registered with the SEC via Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933. It also states that the fund is neither a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 nor a commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act. Therefore, the fund and its sponsoring company will not be regulated as a commodity pool operator or advisor. Cboe's filing noted that the SEC has granted approvals for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the past. In those approvals, the SEC found that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures markets were not ‚Äúsignificant in size‚Äù but provided ‚Äúother adequate means‚Äù to prevent fraud and manipulation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-30T21:17:21,"Bitcoin holders' unrealized profit has reached a new peak of $1.41 trillion","Bitcoin investors now have $1.41 trillion in unrealized profit, according to Glassnode. The on-chain analytics platform disclosed this, noting that it is an all-time high in unrealized gains. According to Glassnode, this is the highest paper gains for Bitcoin investors, surpassing the $1.3 trillion in November 2024. Based on this milestone, analysts believe there could be distribution pressure for Bitcoin if prices continue to increase, leading to holders selling. Bitcoin unrealized gains reach a record high (Source: Glassnode) They wrote: ‚ÄúThis massive paper gain concentration sets the stage for potential future distribution pressure if prices continue higher.‚Äù Interestingly, the Glassnode analysts appear to be doubling down on this point based on the new level of unrealized profits. They noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs unrealized profits as a percentage of its market cap have passed the +2œÉ band. This level is historically tied to market euphoria, similar to the previous all-time highs. Thus, it usually comes with increased selling pressure as holders are likely to sell off and take profits. As to whether there could be sell-offs to take profits, it does not help that long-term holders control the majority of the BTC supply. Glassnode data also noted that these long-term holders currently have 53% of BTC despite their recent distributions. Thus, any further price increase could reignite distributions, pushing BTC further down and causing additional volatility. However, that has been changing, with 223,602 BTC moving from long-term to short-term holders in the past 30 days. Is Bitcoin at its market top? However, not everyone believes that the $1.4 trillion in unrealized profit is significant enough to have any major impact on BTC‚Äôs performance in the short term. Crypto analyst Rezo noted that it is important to consider context, even though $1.41 trillion might sound massive. According to him, Bitcoin‚Äôs current market price versus realized price (MVRV) is 2.26, which is far below the historical cycle top of around 3.7 and above. Thus, he does not expect any distribution yet. He said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not even close to distribution territory yet. 2017 and 2021 both peaked above 12x for long-term holders.‚Äù Although several other experts agree with this opinion, some also question whether it is right to base any expectation on historical peaks. On-chain analyst Barƒ±≈ü Karde≈ü noted that doing so could give some investors a false sense of security similar to what happened in the 2021 cycle. That's a valid perspective, and using relative metrics like MVRV is definitely more insightful than looking at absolute numbers alone.

The flagship asset recently absorbed a sell-off of 80,000 BTC over the weekend without much impact on its price. Bitcoin adoption continues to grow Meanwhile, more signs of crypto adoption in the US are emerging even as Bitcoin and other tokens significantly decline in value. Several developments have happened in the past few days, including the US government publishing its first digital assets report . The report, which is based on President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order, stated that the government will work on strategies to allow it to acquire more BTC for the strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also posted videos supporting crypto and recently released an op-ed in the Washington Post discussing the ‚ÄúRoadmap to make America a crypto superpower.‚Äù All these developments are happening in less than 24 hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in-kind creation and redemption for the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, there have not been any significant price movements. Despite all these positive developments, Bitcoin‚Äôs performance over the last 24 hours remains in the red, likely due to interest cooling down.

2025-07-30T21:10:42,"Claude AI vs ChatGPT Forecast Bitcoin Breakout, ‚ÄòSpring‚Äô Tension Targets $130K Peak","Bitcoin is trading at $117,832.50 with minimal daily movement ( -0.10% ) as both Claude and ChatGPT identify a key consolidation phase near all-time highs that could determine the next major directional move. However, they differ in probability weightings and risk assessment approaches. The synthesis of their analyses reveals a 65% probability of an upward breakout, a 25% chance of correction scenarios, and a 10% likelihood of extended consolidation. Current Market Position and Technical Structure Bitcoin‚Äôs position at $117,832.50 represents what both models identify as a ‚Äúcompressed spring‚Äù setup, trading within an exceptionally tight daily range of just $1,123 ( 0.95% of current price). The technical foundation remains overwhelmingly bullish, with price maintaining strength above all major exponential moving averages: 20-day EMA at $116,935.93 ( -0.8% ), 50-day EMA at $112,724.93 ( -4.3% ), 100-day EMA at $107,357.63 ( -8.9% ), and 200-day EMA at $100,041.53 ( -15.1% ). Source: TradingView The RSI reading of 57.61 sits in neutral territory, which both analyses point out as particularly essential given Bitcoin‚Äôs proximity to all-time highs. Typically, assets trading near historic peaks exhibit overbought RSI readings above 70 , making the balanced momentum reading a bullish divergence sign. The MACD structure shows mixed signs with the main line at -469.62 below zero, but the positive histogram at 2,330.79 suggests building momentum despite current bearish positioning. Source: TradingView Volume analysis reveals daily trading at just 6.59K BTC, representing what both models interpret as institutional accumulation rather than distribution. The extremely high ATR reading of 106,893.57 contrasts sharply with the current low volatility, creating what technical analysts call a ‚Äúvolatility paradox‚Äù that often precedes strong price moves. Historical Context and 2025 Performance Trajectory Bitcoin‚Äôs 2025 journey provides key context for understanding current positioning. Starting the year at $102,405 in January, the cryptocurrency experienced a consolidation phase through spring, trading between $107,500-$110,000 from February through May. June saw a modest close at $110,467 before July‚Äôs explosive rally to current levels near $119,850 by month-end. Source TradingView This historical pattern demonstrates Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to break from extended consolidation periods with strong momentum, similar to the current setup. The fact that Bitcoin has maintained its July gains without a major correction suggests underlying strength that both AI models identify as institutional accumulation rather than speculative excess. Institutional Dynamics and Market Structure Both analyses emphasize unprecedented institutional adoption as a primary bullish catalyst. Strategy‚Äôs recent acquisition of 21,021 BTC worth $2.46 billion , bringing total holdings to 628,791 BTC valued at $74 billion , represents the scale of corporate treasury adoption accelerating through 2025 . The SEC‚Äôs approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for spot Bitcoin ETFs eliminates previous operational friction for institutional participants. Over 80 million @jpmorgan @Chase customers can now use credit cards to buy crypto on @coinbase , with direct bank links and USDC reward conversions scheduled for 2026. #crypto #banking https://t.co/Cms94p3x7I ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 The JPMorgan-Coinbase partnership allows mainstream banking integration, while companies like Smarter Web Company, which has crossed 2,000 BTC holdings , and Canaan are adopting Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset, demonstrating the expanding corporate adoption trend. These developments collectively represent what both models identify as structural changes in Bitcoin‚Äôs holder composition, creating more stable price floors and reducing available supply for retail trading. Current market metrics support this institutional thesis, with market capitalization at $2.34 trillion and fully diluted valuation at $2.47 trillion . The circulating supply of 19.89 million BTC represents 94.7% of the maximum supply, highlighting growing scarcity as institutional demand accelerates. Social Sentiment Analysis and Contrarian Signals Social sentiment data presents a fascinating paradox that both AI models identify as a bullish contrarian sign. Despite Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, retail sentiment has declined to yearly lows, with LunarCrush data showing AltRank down 229 positions and Galaxy Score declining 13 points. However, overall sentiment maintains 81% positivity with 90.98 million engagements and 292.17K mentions. The key insight both analyses highlight is the divergence between institutional accumulation and retail pessimism. Not sure about you but i am not worried through #Bitcoin short term upside-downside.

The current social dominance of 19.35% indicates strong but not extreme retail attention, leaving room for sentiment-driven momentum. Recent social media analysis reveals approximately 80% bullish sentiment among active traders, though broader retail metrics suggest caution. Gold went parabolic after this breakout.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Catalysts Both analyses emphasize improving regulatory clarity as a strong bullish catalyst. The pending White House crypto report , though initially not including strategic Bitcoin reserve details, represents progress toward a comprehensive policy framework. Today the White House is releasing its comprehensive report on digital assets, providing long-awaited regulatory clarity for innovators in a cutting-edge industry. President Trump is delivering on his promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. pic.twitter.com/hrp8uQwf76 ‚Äî David Sacks (@davidsacks47) July 30, 2025 The GENIUS Act implementation and broader regulatory developments provide institutional confidence for treasury allocation decisions. Recent headlines confirm accelerating corporate adoption with companies implementing Bitcoin reserve policies and expanding holdings. This regulatory clarity removes previous institutional barriers, allowing both models to identify the corporate treasury adoption trend as a primary 90-day catalyst. 90-Day Scenario Analysis Bullish Breakout Scenario (65% Probability) Target Range: $125,000-$140,000 Both models converge on this scenario as most likely, driven by institutional accumulation acceleration and technical breakout from current consolidation. The scenario requires decisive movement above $118,482 resistance with volume confirmation, followed by momentum toward $120,000-$122,000 resistance cluster within 30 days . Timeline expectations include initial breakout within 2 weeks , consolidation and retest of breakout levels through day 30-45 , followed by acceleration toward $125,000-$130,000 by day 60-75 . Source: TradingView The more aggressive targets of $135,000-$140,000 depend on sustained institutional flows and potential positive regulatory developments. Key success metrics include daily volume expansion above 10,000 BTC, successful hold above $120,000 psychological resistance, and continued institutional accumulation. The scenario assumes no major macroeconomic disruptions and steady progress on regulatory clarity. Correction Scenario (25% Probability) Target Range: $100,000-$112,000 This scenario involves failure to break above the current resistance, leading to testing of major support levels. Initial decline would target the 20-day EMA at $116,936 , followed by potential testing of 50-day EMA support at $112,725 . Deeper correction could reach the 100-day EMA at $107,358 or psychological $100,000 support. Source: TradingView Trigger events include macroeconomic shocks, unexpected regulatory setbacks, or major institutional selling. The scenario would unfold over 30-45 days , with initial decline followed by stabilization and potential base-building for future recovery. Recovery catalysts would include institutional buying at lower levels, positive regulatory developments, or broader risk-asset recovery. Both models view strong institutional selling as unlikely given current accumulation trends. Extended Consolidation (10% Probability) Target Range: $115,000-$120,000 This scenario involves continued sideways movement in the current range for 45-60 days before directional resolution. Characteristics include low volume maintenance, ongoing institutional accumulation without retail participation, and delayed catalyst timing. Source: TradingView The consolidation would create optimal accumulation opportunities for institutional participants while allowing technical indicators to reset. Resolution would ultimately favor the bullish scenario given the underlying fundamental strength. Technical Price Targets and Key Levels Immediate resistance emerges at today‚Äôs high of $118,482 , with a breakout requiring sustained volume above 8,000-10,000 BTC daily. Key resistance cluster spans $119,000-$122,000 , representing previous consolidation highs and psychological levels. Primary upside targets include $125,000 as the first major extension ( 6% upside), $130,000 as a strong resistance cluster ( 10% upside), and $135,000-$140,000 as aggressive targets ( 15-19% upside). Extended targets reach $150,000, representing 27% upside potential. Source: TradingView Key support levels include $116,936 ( 20-day EMA) as key short-term support, $112,725 ( 50-day EMA) as major trend support, and $107,358 ( 100-day EMA) as key long-term support. The $100,042 ( 200-day EMA) represents historic trend line support. Risk Assessment and Management Considerations Primary risks include macroeconomic volatility from Fed policy changes or geopolitical developments, unexpected regulatory reversals, and technical breakdown below key support levels.

Market Structure Evolution and Supply Dynamics The evolving market structure reflects fundamental shifts in Bitcoin ownership patterns. Exchange reserves continue declining as institutions move holdings to cold storage, while long-term holders maintain positions despite near-ATH pricing. Source: CryptoQuant Mining operations show reduced selling pressure due to efficient operations and strong price levels. Demand dynamics show accelerating institutional allocation, consistent ETF positive flows, improving retail access through banking partnerships, and growing sovereign wealth fund interest. These supply-demand imbalances support both models‚Äô bullish medium-term outlook. Next Price Trajectory: Synthesis and Conclusion Synthesizing both AI analyses with current market data reveals a compelling setup for strong upward movement within 90 days . The confluence of technical consolidation near all-time highs, unprecedented institutional accumulation, improving regulatory clarity, and contrarian retail sentiment creates what both models identify as optimal conditions for major price appreciation. Base Case Trajectory (65% probability): Breakout above $118,500 within 10-14 days , momentum toward $120,000-$122,000 by day 30 , consolidation and retest through day 45 , followed by acceleration toward $125,000-$130,000 by day 75-90 . Timeline Expectations: Days 1-14: Breakout above $118,500 with volume confirmation Days 15-30: Initial momentum toward $120,000-$122,000 resistance Days 31-45: Consolidation and support level testing Days 46-75: Resumed uptrend toward $125,000-$130,000 Days 76-90: Potential extension toward $135,000-$140,000 The current technical setup suggests Bitcoin is positioned for its next major bull leg, with the tight consolidation pattern serving as the launching pad for what could be a historic fourth quarter 2025 rally. The institutional adoption acceleration, regulatory clarity progress, and supply scarcity dynamics support conviction in higher price targets, while the contrarian retail sentiment provides optimal entry conditions before broader market recognition drives prices higher.

2025-07-30T21:10:11,"Bitcoin Supply Rotation: Unpacking the Dramatic 223K BTC Holder Shift","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Supply Rotation: Unpacking the Dramatic 223K BTC Holder Shift Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? Then you‚Äôve likely heard whispers of significant movements beneath the surface. A truly intriguing development has caught the attention of market analysts: a massive Bitcoin supply rotation . Over the past 30 days, an astounding 223,602 BTC, equivalent to billions of dollars, has transitioned from the wallets of long-term holders (LTHs) to those of short-term holders (STHs). This isn‚Äôt just a statistical blip; it‚Äôs a profound shift that could signal evolving market dynamics and potential future price action. This report, highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn on X, underscores a growing momentum in how Bitcoin‚Äôs available supply is being redistributed, making it a crucial indicator for anyone invested in the digital asset space. What Exactly is Bitcoin Supply Rotation and Why Does It Matter? Before diving deeper into the implications of this particular shift, let‚Äôs clarify what Bitcoin supply rotation truly means. In the world of cryptocurrency, holders are often categorized based on how long they‚Äôve held their assets. Long-term holders (LTHs) are typically those who have held their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. These individuals or entities are often seen as ‚Äòstrong hands‚Äô ‚Äì investors with conviction, less likely to sell during price fluctuations, and who generally accumulate Bitcoin for its long-term value proposition. They are the bedrock of Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity model. Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are the patient investors. They often buy Bitcoin and hold it through market cycles, seeing it as a store of value or a long-term investment. Their selling activity can indicate significant shifts in market sentiment or profit-taking after substantial rallies. Short-Term Holders (STHs): Conversely, short-term holders are those who have acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. This group often includes traders, speculators, or new market entrants who might be more reactive to price movements, seeking quicker gains, or simply experimenting with crypto. Their buying and selling patterns tend to contribute more to short-term volatility. When Bitcoin moves from an LTH to an STH, it signifies that an asset previously held with a long-term perspective has now entered the realm of potential short-term trading or distribution. This shift matters immensely because it changes the ‚Äòliquidity profile‚Äô of the circulating supply. Bitcoin held by LTHs is often considered ‚Äòilliquid‚Äô or ‚Äòdormant‚Äô supply, while Bitcoin held by STHs is more ‚Äòliquid‚Äô and readily available for sale on exchanges. A significant Bitcoin supply rotation from LTHs to STHs suggests that a substantial amount of previously dormant supply is now active and could potentially exert selling pressure if STHs decide to realize profits or cut losses. Decoding the 223K BTC Bitcoin Supply Rotation Data The specific figure reported by Maartunn ‚Äì 223,602 BTC ‚Äì is not just a large number; it represents a considerable portion of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply. To put this into perspective, this amount is roughly 1.14% of Bitcoin‚Äôs current circulating supply of approximately 19.7 million BTC. This movement occurred within a mere 30-day window, highlighting the rapid pace of this transition. Such a rapid and large-scale shift is precisely why it warrants close examination. On-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant provide invaluable insights into these movements by tracking Bitcoin‚Äôs journey across different wallet types and timeframes. Maartunn‚Äôs report leverages these sophisticated tools to identify when coins that haven‚Äôt moved for extended periods suddenly become active again, indicating a change in holder type. This isn‚Äôt about identifying specific individuals, but rather understanding the aggregate behavior of large groups of market participants. Consider the implications: Increased Market Liquidity: More Bitcoin is now in the hands of those who are more likely to trade it, potentially increasing liquidity on exchanges. Potential for Volatility: STHs are typically more sensitive to price swings. Their reactions can amplify market movements, both upwards and downwards. Profit Realization: Many LTHs accumulated Bitcoin at much lower prices. This shift could indicate significant profit-taking after Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive rally, including its recent ascent towards new all-time highs. This data serves as a critical pulse check on the market‚Äôs underlying health and sentiment. It tells us that a significant portion of the ‚Äòold‚Äô supply is now in ‚Äònew‚Äô hands, and those new hands might have different intentions than the original long-term holders. What Triggers a Major Bitcoin Supply Rotation Among Holders? Understanding the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind this substantial Bitcoin supply rotation is key to anticipating its effects. Several factors could be motivating long-term holders to finally part with their cherished coins: Profit-Taking After Price Surges: Bitcoin has seen remarkable price appreciation in recent months, even hitting new all-time highs. Many LTHs acquired their BTC at significantly lower prices, sometimes even below $10,000 or $20,000. Reaching new peaks provides an opportune moment for these holders to realize substantial profits, de-risking their portfolios or funding other ventures. This is a natural cycle in bull markets. Anticipation of a Market Correction: Some LTHs might be taking profits out of a belief that the market is overheated and due for a correction. They might be front-running a potential downturn, planning to buy back at lower prices. This strategic move is common among seasoned investors. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation concerns, interest rate policies, or geopolitical events, can influence investment decisions across all asset classes, including Bitcoin. LTHs might be re-evaluating their asset allocation in response to these macro shifts. Influence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the US have introduced a new avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. While ETFs have brought new demand, they might also be indirectly influencing LTH behavior. Some LTHs might be moving their holdings to benefit from the liquidity and regulatory clarity offered by ETFs, or perhaps converting their direct holdings into ETF shares for ease of management. Market Sentiment Shifts: A subtle but powerful factor is the overall market sentiment. If the prevailing sentiment shifts from extreme greed to caution, even LTHs might feel compelled to secure gains. It‚Äôs rarely a single factor but often a confluence of these elements that drives such a significant shift. The sheer volume of 223,602 BTC suggests a coordinated or at least widely shared rationale among a large segment of the long-term holding community. How Does This Bitcoin Supply Rotation Impact Market Dynamics? The transition of such a large quantity of Bitcoin into the hands of short-term holders has several potential implications for the market‚Äôs immediate and medium-term future. This isn‚Äôt just a theoretical exercise; it has tangible effects on how Bitcoin‚Äôs price might behave. Increased Volatility: STHs are inherently more sensitive to price movements. They are more likely to buy on dips and sell on rallies, or panic sell during sharp corrections. This increased reactivity can lead to amplified price swings, making the market more volatile in the short term. Potential for Selling Pressure: With more Bitcoin in ‚Äòweaker hands‚Äô (meaning, less conviction to hold through significant drawdowns), there‚Äôs a higher potential for increased selling pressure. If the market experiences a downturn, STHs might be quicker to liquidate their positions, potentially accelerating a price decline. Shift in Market Structure: This shift can alter the market‚Äôs underlying structure. When LTHs dominate, the market often exhibits greater stability due to their ‚Äòhodling‚Äô behavior. As STHs gain more control over the circulating supply, the market might become more susceptible to speculative movements and liquidity shocks. Opportunity for New Entrants: On the flip side, this supply rotation also represents an opportunity. As LTHs sell, new buyers, including new retail investors or institutions entering via ETFs, are absorbing this supply. This indicates a healthy demand side, preventing a complete collapse in prices. It‚Äôs a natural process of supply meeting demand, where old money takes profits and new money enters the ecosystem. Re-evaluation of Market Cycle Stage: Analysts often use LTH/STH behavior as a proxy for market cycle stages. A significant LTH distribution event like this can suggest that the market is transitioning from an accumulation phase into a distribution or profit-taking phase, which often precedes a cooling-off period or correction. It‚Äôs important to remember that these are potential outcomes. The actual impact will depend on a multitude of factors, including overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and the continued influx of new demand. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Your Strategy Amidst Bitcoin Supply Rotation Given this significant Bitcoin supply rotation , how should you, as an investor or enthusiast, approach the market? Understanding these dynamics isn‚Äôt just academic; it‚Äôs crucial for informed decision-making. Monitor On-Chain Metrics Closely: Continue to follow reports from on-chain analysts like Maartunn and platforms such as CryptoQuant or Glassnode. These tools offer real-time insights into supply dynamics, exchange flows, and holder behavior, providing an edge in understanding market trends. Key metrics to watch include Exchange Netflow, Miner Reserves, and Dormancy Flow. Practice Risk Management: With potentially increased volatility, solid risk management becomes paramount. This includes setting clear stop-loss levels, diversifying your portfolio (if appropriate), and not over-leveraging. Re-evaluate Your Investment Horizon: If you are a long-term investor, this shift might present opportunities to accumulate more Bitcoin during potential dips. If you are a short-term trader, be prepared for sharper price movements and adjust your strategies accordingly. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many, dollar-cost averaging remains a prudent strategy. Consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can help mitigate the risks associated with volatility and allows you to average into positions. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: The crypto market is prone to emotional reactions. Base your decisions on data and analysis, not fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). This Bitcoin supply rotation is a natural market phenomenon, not necessarily a harbinger of doom. While the transfer of 223,602 BTC is substantial, it‚Äôs also a sign of a maturing market where participants are actively managing their positions based on evolving conditions. Your ability to adapt and understand these underlying shifts will be key to navigating the road ahead. Challenges and Considerations While on-chain data offers incredible transparency, interpreting it comes with its own set of challenges. It‚Äôs vital to remember that correlation does not always imply causation. A Bitcoin supply rotation from LTHs to STHs is a strong signal, but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee a specific outcome. Other factors, such as macro-economic surprises, regulatory changes, or unforeseen black swan events, can always influence the market in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the motivations behind LTH selling can be diverse, from profit-taking to rebalancing portfolios for tax purposes, making a singular interpretation difficult. It‚Äôs always best to consider these on-chain metrics as part of a broader analytical framework. The dramatic 223,602 BTC shift from long-term to short-term holders, as reported by CryptoQuant‚Äôs Maartunn, is a compelling narrative in the ongoing Bitcoin story. It signals a significant redistribution of supply, moving from patient, conviction-driven hands to more active, potentially speculative ones. This Bitcoin supply rotation is a natural part of market cycles, particularly after periods of strong price appreciation. While it introduces the potential for increased volatility and short-term selling pressure, it also highlights the market‚Äôs ability to absorb substantial supply and welcome new participants. For investors, understanding this underlying dynamic is crucial. It underscores the importance of on-chain analysis, prudent risk management, and a clear investment strategy. As Bitcoin continues its journey, these shifts in holder behavior will remain key indicators for charting its future course. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main significance of 223K BTC moving from long-term to short-term holders? This movement signifies that a large amount of previously dormant Bitcoin is now in the hands of more active traders and speculators. It suggests potential profit-taking by long-term holders and could lead to increased market liquidity and short-term volatility, as these new holders are more likely to buy and sell based on recent price action. Q2: How do analysts identify a ‚Äòlong-term holder‚Äô versus a ‚Äòshort-term holder‚Äô? Analysts typically define long-term holders (LTHs) as entities that have held their Bitcoin for more than 155 days, based on on-chain data. Short-term holders (STHs) are those who have acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. This distinction helps categorize market participants by their typical holding duration and investment intent. Q3: Does this Bitcoin supply rotation necessarily mean a price drop is coming? Not necessarily. While a significant shift to short-term holders can increase the potential for selling pressure and volatility, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee a price drop. It could also indicate healthy demand absorbing the supply from long-term holders. The actual outcome depends on overall market sentiment, new demand, and macroeconomic factors. Q4: What actionable steps can an investor take in response to this supply shift? Investors should consider monitoring on-chain metrics, practicing robust risk management (e.g., setting stop-losses), re-evaluating their investment horizon, and potentially employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging. Staying informed and making decisions based on data rather than emotion is crucial during such shifts. Q5: Is this Bitcoin supply rotation a common occurrence in crypto markets? Yes, significant Bitcoin supply rotation events are a natural part of market cycles, especially after periods of substantial price appreciation. Long-term holders often take profits at market peaks, and this supply is then absorbed by new entrants or short-term traders, contributing to the dynamic nature of the crypto market.

2025-07-30T21:05:11,"Tariff Impact on Economy: Powell Warns of Rising Prices and Inflationary Pressures","BitcoinWorld Tariff Impact on Economy: Powell Warns of Rising Prices and Inflationary Pressures In the dynamic world of global finance and economics, statements from key figures like Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, carry significant weight. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macroeconomic signals is crucial, as they often ripple through traditional markets and influence digital asset valuations. Recently, Powell highlighted a critical issue: the direct connection between tariffs and rising commodity prices. This insight is not just a passing comment; it‚Äôs a window into the inflationary pressures that could shape monetary policy and, by extension, the economic landscape for months to come. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what Powell‚Äôs remarks mean for the broader Tariff Impact on Economy . Understanding the Tariff Impact on Economy : What Did Powell Really Say? Jerome Powell‚Äôs recent statements underscore a significant concern for the Federal Reserve. He explicitly noted that some commodity prices have indeed risen due to the imposition of tariffs. This isn‚Äôt just an observation; it‚Äôs a confirmation of an economic reality. Furthermore, the Fed anticipates that Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE), a key inflation gauge, is projected to increase by 2.7% year-on-year through June. This figure is higher than the Fed‚Äôs typical 2% target, signaling potential inflationary pressures. To grasp the full implications, let‚Äôs break down the core components of his statement: Tariffs and Commodity Prices: Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. When these taxes are levied on raw materials or essential commodities, the cost of production for businesses increases. This elevated cost is often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for finished goods. Powell‚Äôs acknowledgement validates this direct link, highlighting how trade policy can fuel inflation. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE): The PCE index measures the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. It‚Äôs the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation because it captures a broader range of spending and accounts for changes in consumer behavior. A projected 2.7% increase signifies that consumers are spending more, but a significant portion of that increase might be due to rising prices rather than increased consumption volume. Implications for Monetary Policy: The Fed‚Äôs dual mandate includes maintaining maximum employment and stable prices. When inflation, as indicated by PCE, starts to trend above their target, it typically signals a need for monetary policy adjustments, such as interest rate hikes, to cool down the economy and bring prices back under control. How Does the Tariff Impact on Economy Ripple Through Consumer Spending? The immediate consequence of rising commodity prices due to tariffs is felt directly by consumers. Imagine the domino effect: Increased Production Costs: Businesses that rely on imported raw materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, agricultural products) face higher input costs due to tariffs. These costs eat into profit margins, forcing companies to make a choice: absorb the costs or pass them on. Higher Consumer Prices: More often than not, businesses pass on these increased costs to the end-consumer. This means everything from your groceries to your new car might become more expensive. This phenomenon is known as cost-push inflation, where rising production costs lead to higher prices. Erosion of Purchasing Power: When prices rise but wages don‚Äôt keep pace, consumers‚Äô purchasing power diminishes. Their money buys less than it used to. This can lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending on non-essential items, potentially slowing economic growth. Impact on Savings and Investments: Inflation erodes the real value of savings over time. If your savings account earns 1% interest but inflation is 2.7%, you‚Äôre effectively losing money. For investors, this means seeking assets that can act as a hedge against inflation, which often includes commodities or, for some, cryptocurrencies. Beyond Commodity Prices: The Broader Tariff Impact on Economy While the immediate focus is on commodity prices, the ramifications of tariffs extend far beyond. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that a tariff imposed by one nation can have a cascade of effects: Area of Impact Description Supply Chain Disruptions Tariffs can force companies to re-evaluate their supply chains, seeking alternative, often more expensive, sources for materials. This can lead to delays and inefficiencies. Reduced Trade Volumes Higher costs associated with tariffs can reduce the overall volume of international trade, impacting global economic growth. Retaliatory Measures Often, tariffs lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, escalating trade disputes and harming export-oriented industries. Investment Uncertainty The unpredictable nature of trade wars and tariffs can deter foreign direct investment, as businesses become hesitant to commit capital in an unstable environment. These broader impacts can lead to slower economic growth, job losses in affected sectors, and increased market volatility, creating a challenging environment for businesses and investors alike. Navigating the Tariff Impact on Economy : Strategies for Businesses and Investors Given the potential for ongoing inflationary pressures due to tariffs, what steps can businesses and investors take? For Businesses: Diversify Supply Chains: Reduce reliance on single-country suppliers, especially those from nations involved in trade disputes. Optimize Inventory Management: Hold sufficient inventory to mitigate short-term price spikes, but avoid overstocking which ties up capital. Explore Domestic Sourcing: If viable, shifting to domestic suppliers can reduce exposure to international tariffs. Improve Efficiency: Focus on internal cost reductions and operational efficiencies to offset rising input costs. For Investors: Consider Inflation Hedges: Assets like real estate, certain commodities (e.g., gold, oil), and inflation-indexed bonds (TIPS) can perform well during inflationary periods. Evaluate Equity Exposure: Focus on companies with strong pricing power that can pass on higher costs to consumers without losing market share. Avoid companies with high import dependencies and low pricing power. Monitor Central Bank Actions: Keep a close eye on Federal Reserve announcements and other central bank policies, as interest rate decisions will significantly impact asset valuations. Cryptocurrency as an Alternative: While volatile, some investors view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against fiat currency debasement and inflation, particularly given their decentralized nature and finite supply (like Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million coin cap). Conclusion: The Enduring Challenge of Tariffs and Inflation Jerome Powell‚Äôs recent remarks serve as a potent reminder that economic policies, even those seemingly distant from everyday life, have profound and direct consequences. The rising commodity prices attributed to tariffs are not merely abstract economic data points; they translate into higher costs for consumers and businesses, contributing to inflationary pressures that the Federal Reserve must address. As the PCE index continues to be closely watched, the Fed‚Äôs response will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of interest rates, economic growth, and asset markets, including the volatile but increasingly relevant cryptocurrency space. Navigating this complex environment requires vigilance, strategic planning, and a keen understanding of the interplay between trade policy, inflation, and monetary action. The Tariff Impact on Economy is a challenge that demands our ongoing attention. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) and why is it important? A1: PCE measures the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. It‚Äôs the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge because it covers a broad range of spending and accounts for consumer behavior shifts, providing a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures. Q2: How do tariffs contribute to inflation? A2: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. When these taxes are applied to raw materials or components, they increase production costs for businesses. These higher costs are then typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher retail prices, leading to inflation. Q3: What are the potential actions the Federal Reserve might take in response to rising inflation? A3: If inflation rises above its target, the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policies, such as increasing interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and help bring inflation back under control. Q4: Can cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin act as a hedge against inflation caused by tariffs? A4: Some investors view Bitcoin, with its finite supply, as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. However, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and their effectiveness as an inflation hedge is still a subject of ongoing debate and depends on various market factors. Q5: How can businesses mitigate the negative effects of tariffs? A5: Businesses can mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying their supply chains, optimizing inventory management, exploring domestic sourcing options, and focusing on internal operational efficiencies to reduce overall costs.

Each has its own strengths, but only one is purpose-built for modern crypto users. In this comparison, we take a detailed look at the core features of these three giants to help crypto gamblers decide where to play next. From sign-up flow to deposit methods and overall flexibility, here‚Äôs how they stack up. Spartans: Built for Crypto Gamblers From the Ground Up Spartans takes a different approach entirely. This platform is built with crypto users in mind, eliminating the usual friction seen on most sites. The sign-up process is instant, requiring nothing more than an email address and confirmation that the user is 18 or older. There is no mandatory KYC, which makes Spartans particularly appealing to players who value their privacy and don‚Äôt want to deal with documentation hurdles just to play or cash out. The platform supports a wide array of tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Avalanche (AVAX), and more. Deposits and withdrawals are fast, typically completed in under 10 minutes. There is direct integration with major wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, giving users complete control over their funds. Spartans also supports both casino games and sports betting, merging both verticals into one crypto-friendly dashboard. Compared to Bet365, Spartans provides far greater utility for crypto holders. And when stacked against Stake.com, Spartans wins on reduced friction, broader token support, and the lack of forced identity verification. For users specifically seeking to compare betting sites on how well they handle crypto from sign-up to cash-out, Spartans clearly leads. Stake.com: Polished, Popular, but Not Entirely Frictionless Stake.com has built a strong reputation in the crypto betting space, particularly among players who appreciate a visually clean interface and extensive betting markets. The site offers access to a wide range of casino games, live dealer tables, and sports betting options. However, its major drawback is the account verification process. Despite being positioned as a crypto-first platform, users are often required to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for larger transactions or withdrawals. This can be a roadblock for gamblers who value privacy or want quick access to their winnings. Additionally, while Stake supports popular tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, there are limitations on wallet compatibility and payment speed. Deposits are generally fast, but the occasional verification delays or payout holds can undercut the experience. Stake‚Äôs appeal is largely rooted in its brand partnerships and smooth design, but those factors don‚Äôt always outweigh the hidden trade-offs for crypto-focused users. Bet365: A Legacy Powerhouse With Limited Crypto Appeal Bet365 remains a dominant force in the traditional sports betting space. Its coverage of events is vast, and its odds and analytics tools are among the best in the business. However, when it comes to crypto functionality, Bet365 falls short. The platform does not natively support crypto deposits or withdrawals. Users must rely on third-party conversion services or intermediaries, making the experience clunky and time-consuming. For crypto gamblers who prioritize speed, anonymity, and blockchain-based payments, Bet365 simply isn‚Äôt built to support those expectations. It still leans heavily on legacy banking infrastructure, which means slower withdrawals, potential payment rejections, and extra fees. While the platform is robust and trustworthy for fiat users, it misses the mark entirely for those looking to compare betting sites based on crypto readiness. User Experience: Where Speed and Simplicity Win When it comes to overall usability, all three platforms offer competent interfaces, but only Spartans minimizes unnecessary steps for the end user. Stake.com‚Äôs interface is clean but marred by unexpected verification requirements. Bet365 is functional but shows its age when it comes to crypto options and onboarding. Spartans, by contrast, loads quickly across devices and simplifies navigation, whether the user is placing a multi-leg sports parlay or spinning high-volatility slot games. The platform is fully mobile optimized, which adds to its accessibility for users who prefer to gamble on the go without downloading separate apps. Bonuses and Promotions: Who Gives More for Your Crypto? Stake.com and Bet365 both offer a variety of bonuses, but these often come with complex eligibility conditions or region-based limitations. Spartans, on the other hand, offers a 300% welcome bonus for both casino and sports bettors, with only a $5 minimum deposit to qualify. The platform also includes daily reload bonuses and seasonal events, including high-profile giveaways like a Lamborghini prize draw. These offers are tailored to crypto users and require no bank involvement to access or redeem, making them far more practical for regular bettors. The Best Platform for Crypto Gamblers? If your priority is a platform that lets you deposit, bet, and withdraw crypto quickly and without third-party interference, Spartans is the clear winner. Stake.com may look polished, but it still imposes KYC checks that can delay your access to funds. Bet365 offers excellent betting tools but does not support crypto in a meaningful way. For players looking to compare betting sites and find the one that truly understands crypto culture and functionality, Spartans checks all the boxes. It‚Äôs simple, direct, and built to match the speed and privacy crypto gamblers expect.

In an internal company memo reviewed by CNBC , a JPMorgan systems employee noted that only 13% of those requests were initiated by a customer for transactions. ‚ÄúAggregators are accessing customer data multiple times daily, even when the customer is not actively using the app. These access requests are massively taxing our systems.‚Äù An anonymous source with knowledge of the memo tells CNBC that the requests often involve helping fintech companies bolster their products or stop fraud. Earlier this month, JPMorgan informed fintech companies such as PayPal, Venmo and Coinbase that they will need to begin paying to access their customers‚Äô bank account information, a move that sparked controversy in the digital asset sector. Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss claims the investment bank is attempting to sabotage fintech and crypto firms, accusing JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon of trying to wreck President Donald Trump‚Äôs attempts to embrace digital assets. ‚ÄúThis will bankrupt fintechs that help you link your bank accounts to crypto companies like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken so you can easily fund your account with fiat to buy Bitcoin and crypto‚Ä¶ Jamie Dimon and his cronies are trying to undercut President Trump‚Äôs mandate to make America the pro-innovation and the crypto capital of the world. We must fight back!‚Äù Dimon, however, defended the fee proposal during the bank‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call. ‚ÄúSo, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they ‚Äì do they actually know what‚Äôs being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn‚Äôt be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be re-marketed or resold to third parties. And so, we‚Äôre kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs (application programming interfaces) and stuff like that to run the system‚Äôs protection.

2025-07-30T21:00:12,"Crucial: Fed‚Äôs Inflation Target Nears Reality ‚Äì What It Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld Crucial: Fed‚Äôs Inflation Target Nears Reality ‚Äì What It Means for Crypto The financial world recently buzzed with a significant announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell: inflation target is much closer to the desired 2% mark. This statement isn‚Äôt just a dry economic statistic; it‚Äôs a pivotal moment that ripples through every corner of the global economy, including the volatile yet fascinating realm of cryptocurrencies. For investors, traders, and anyone keen on understanding the broader economic landscape, comprehending the implications of this shift is absolutely crucial. Understanding the Fed‚Äôs 2% Inflation Target : Why It Matters To truly grasp the weight of Powell‚Äôs words, we must first understand the Federal Reserve‚Äôs mandate and the significance of the 2% inflation target . The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability. The 2% inflation rate is considered the sweet spot for price stability, offering a balance between economic growth and preventing the corrosive effects of uncontrolled price increases. Price Stability: A low, stable rate of inflation allows businesses and consumers to plan for the future with greater certainty. Economic Growth: Too low inflation (or deflation) can discourage spending and investment, while too high inflation erodes purchasing power. The 2% target aims for healthy, sustainable growth. Policy Flexibility: Hitting the target gives the Fed more room to maneuver interest rates in response to economic downturns. For years, particularly since the pandemic, inflation soared, forcing the Fed to embark on an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes. Now, Powell‚Äôs acknowledgment signals that these efforts are bearing fruit, bringing the economy closer to a state of equilibrium. How Did We Get Here? A Brief Look at the Road to the Inflation Target The journey to taming inflation has been anything but smooth. Post-pandemic, a perfect storm of factors converged to push prices sky-high: Supply Chain Disruptions: Lockdowns and logistics issues severely constrained the supply of goods. Surging Demand: Government stimulus packages and pent-up consumer demand fueled spending. Labor Shortages: A tight labor market led to wage increases, contributing to higher production costs. Geopolitical Events: Conflicts, like the war in Ukraine, impacted energy and food prices globally. In response, the Federal Reserve initiated a series of rapid interest rate increases, making borrowing more expensive to cool down economic activity and reduce demand. This strategy, while painful for some sectors, was designed to bring inflation back to its long-term inflation target . What Does a Nearing Inflation Target Mean for Traditional Markets? The implications for traditional financial markets are profound. A stable inflation outlook often suggests that the Fed may pause or even begin to cut interest rates in the future. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of potential impacts: Asset Class Potential Impact Reasoning Stocks Potentially Positive Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for companies and make future earnings more valuable, boosting valuations. Bonds Mixed to Positive Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive if new bond yields fall. Lower inflation reduces erosion of bond value. Real Estate Potentially Positive Lower mortgage rates can stimulate housing demand and affordability. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that markets are complex, and many other factors are always at play. The Crypto Connection: How Does the Inflation Target Affect Digital Assets? This is where it gets particularly interesting for our audience. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, gained significant traction as an ‚Äòinflation hedge‚Äô during periods of high inflation. The narrative was that a decentralized, finite asset like Bitcoin could protect wealth from the debasement of fiat currencies. But what happens when the inflation target is almost met? Is the ‚ÄòInflation Hedge‚Äô Narrative Still Strong for Crypto? When inflation is high, investors often seek alternative assets. As the Fed brings inflation under control, the urgency for an inflation hedge might diminish. This could lead to a reassessment of Bitcoin‚Äôs primary use case for some investors. However, it doesn‚Äôt invalidate crypto‚Äôs other fundamental value propositions, such as decentralization, censorship resistance, and technological innovation. The Impact of Potential Rate Cuts on Crypto Liquidity If the Fed indeed pivots to rate cuts in the future, it generally signals a more accommodative monetary policy. This typically means: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, potentially freeing up more capital that could flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Risk-On Sentiment: A less restrictive monetary environment often fosters a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment among investors, encouraging them to allocate more to higher-growth, higher-volatility assets. Reduced Dollar Strength: Lower interest rates can weaken the U.S. dollar, which historically has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin‚Äôs price. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international buyers. So, while the direct ‚Äòinflation hedge‚Äô argument might soften, the broader economic conditions fostered by achieving the inflation target could be quite bullish for crypto due to increased liquidity and risk appetite. Challenges and Uncertainties on the Path to the Sustained Inflation Target While Powell‚Äôs statement is optimistic, the path to a sustained 2% inflation target is not without its hurdles. Several factors could still derail progress: Geopolitical Instability: New conflicts or escalations could disrupt supply chains and commodity markets, reigniting inflationary pressures. Energy Price Volatility: Spikes in oil or gas prices could feed into broader inflation. Labor Market Resilience: A persistently tight labor market with strong wage growth could keep services inflation elevated. Second-Round Effects: Businesses might continue to pass on higher costs to consumers, creating a cycle of price increases. The Fed remains data-dependent, meaning future policy decisions will hinge on incoming economic data, not just a single statement. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the evolving economic landscape, what should crypto investors consider? Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. While crypto offers unique opportunities, a balanced portfolio can mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic indicators, Fed announcements, and global events. These will continue to influence market sentiment. Understand the Narratives: Be aware of why people are buying crypto. Is it for speculation, long-term belief in the technology, or a hedge? As economic conditions change, so do these narratives. Long-Term Vision: For many, the underlying technology and transformative potential of blockchain remain the primary drivers for crypto adoption, irrespective of short-term economic cycles. The journey towards the 2% inflation target is a marathon, not a sprint, and its implications for crypto are multifaceted. A Compelling Outlook: The Future Shaped by the Inflation Target Jerome Powell‚Äôs statement marks a significant milestone in the fight against inflation. It signals that the economy is moving towards a more stable environment, potentially paving the way for future interest rate adjustments that could benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the ‚Äòinflation hedge‚Äô narrative for crypto may evolve, the broader implications of increased liquidity and a more predictable economic climate could create fertile ground for the digital asset space. As always, informed decision-making and a clear understanding of both macroeconomic trends and specific asset fundamentals will be key to navigating the opportunities ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% inflation target ? A1: The Federal Reserve aims for an average annual inflation rate of 2% as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. This target is considered optimal for achieving price stability and supporting maximum sustainable employment in the economy. Q2: How does reaching the inflation target impact interest rates? A2: When the Federal Reserve believes inflation is sustainably moving towards or has reached its 2% target, it may consider pausing interest rate hikes or even beginning to cut rates. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, which can stimulate economic activity but also influence asset prices. Q3: Is Bitcoin still a good inflation hedge if the inflation target is met? A3: The narrative of Bitcoin as an ‚Äòinflation hedge‚Äô may become less prominent if inflation is under control. However, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies possess other fundamental characteristics, such as decentralization and scarcity, which continue to appeal to investors regardless of inflation levels. Their value proposition extends beyond just hedging against inflation. Q4: What are the main risks that could prevent the Fed from sustaining the 2% inflation target ? A4: Several risks could challenge the sustained achievement of the 2% inflation target. These include unforeseen geopolitical events that disrupt supply chains, unexpected spikes in commodity prices (like oil), or a persistently tight labor market leading to wage-price spirals. The Fed constantly monitors these factors. Q5: How should crypto investors adjust their strategy based on the inflation target news? A5: Crypto investors should prioritize staying informed about macroeconomic developments and the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy. While a stable inflation environment might reduce the ‚Äòhedge‚Äô demand, potential rate cuts could increase liquidity and risk appetite, benefiting crypto. Diversification, long-term vision, and understanding crypto‚Äôs core value propositions beyond just inflation hedging are crucial.

2025-07-30T20:57:54,"Stocks and crypto slides following Fed rate decision today","Stocks reversed sharply on Wednesday after Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve has made ‚Äúno decisions‚Äù on a rate cut for September, ending weeks of speculation across Wall Street and crypto markets. The statement came during a press conference following the Fed‚Äôs latest policy meeting and immediately triggered losses across major indexes and crypto assets. Powell also said the central bank is still reviewing how President Donald Trump‚Äôs new tariffs are affecting inflation. The S&P 500 dropped 0.12% to close at 6,362.90 after climbing as much as 0.4% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 171.71 points, or 0.38%, ending at 44,461.28. The Nasdaq Composite was the only major index to finish in the green, gaining 0.15% to settle at 21,129.67. The Fed had left interest rates unchanged during the July meeting, but investors were focused on the press briefing that followed, hoping Powell would hint at cuts coming later in the year. That didn‚Äôt happen. During the briefing, Powell said the Fed‚Äôs priority remains controlling inflation expectations. ‚ÄúOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem,‚Äù he said. He added that ‚Äúhigher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen.‚Äù Crypto losses follow Powell‚Äôs statement The fallout wasn‚Äôt limited to stocks. Over $212 million was wiped out from the crypto market in the hour following Powell‚Äôs comments. That sharp liquidation hit Bitcoin hardest. One of the most-watched indicators for U.S. demand, the Coinbase Premium Index, turned negative for the first time since May 29, ending a 62-day positive streak. The index compares Bitcoin prices between Coinbase and Binance and is often seen as a measure of institutional interest in the U.S. Before flipping negative, the premium index had held positive for a record 94 days, showing strong demand from American buyers. That run is now over, and traders are reassessing positioning. While the sudden drop may signal a cooling appetite, the rest of the data paints a mixed picture. The funding rate for futures contracts stayed flat at 0.01, meaning neither bulls nor bears had a clear advantage. At the same time, the cumulative volume delta (CVD) kept pointing to ongoing sell pressure. Still, the lack of a major breakdown in price shows that buyers haven‚Äôt disappeared entirely. The imbalance between selling and price stability hints at a possible shakeout, but no collapse. There was also no sign of panic from long-term holders. The Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) metric showed no major profit-taking. And the Adjusted SOPR, a signal used to gauge whether traders are selling at a loss or gain, stayed under the 1.10 level that typically signals overheated markets. That suggests people aren‚Äôt rushing to cash out despite the dip. The decision to hold interest rates wasn‚Äôt unanimous. Two members of the Fed board, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, dissented. Both wanted a quarter-point cut instead. While they were outvoted, their stance highlights disagreement inside the central bank about how aggressive monetary policy should be in the face of rising prices from Trump‚Äôs trade moves. Traders had been expecting at least one rate cut before the end of the year. Powell‚Äôs comments made it clear that the timeline is now uncertain. With tariffs pushing up costs on some imported goods, the Fed appears to be in a wait-and-see mode. That uncertainty is now baked into market sentiment. By the closing bell, early optimism had vanished. The markets had turned on Powell‚Äôs words. The Fed is holding steady, tariffs are heating up, and both stocks and crypto took the hit.

2025-07-30T20:54:30,"Samourai Wallet Devs Plead Guilty to Conspiring to Run Unlicensed Money Transmitter","The developers of Bitcoin mixing service Samourai Wallet pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business on Wednesday, taking a plea deal that drastically cut their potential prison time for their role in creating a privacy tool prosecutors say was used to launder more than $100 million in dirty money. In back-to-back hearings in front of U.S. District Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Wednesday, both Keonne Rodriguez and William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Lonergan Hill changed their pleas. The pair were initially charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, to which they'd both pleaded not guilty. Their plea deal with the government struck the more serious money-laundering charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, in exchange for pleading guilty to the lesser, money-transmitting charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. In addition, both Rodriguez and Hill agreed to forfeit just under $238 million combined, with $6.3 million to be paid before their sentencing date in November. Rodriguez and Hill‚Äôs change of plea comes as Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm ‚Äî¬†who faces similar charges for creating another privacy-focused crypto mixing service ‚Äî¬†stands trial in the same court. Storm‚Äôs trial concluded on Wednesday, mere hours after the Samourai Wallet developers pleaded guilty, and the jury is currently deliberating. The government‚Äôs offer of a plea deal to the Samourai Wallet developers came as Storm‚Äôs trial was still ongoing, a source familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Until the pair are sentenced later this year, Cote required them to remain on house arrest, and ordered Hill ‚Äî¬†a resident of Portugal ‚Äî¬†to return to New York to serve the remainder of his house arrest closer to court, Bitcoin Magazine reported .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/30/samourai-wallet-devs-plead-guilty-to-conspiring-to-run-unlicensed-money-transmitter,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","Policy|Samourai Wallet|Court Cases|SDNY|Criminal|News",cryptocompare
