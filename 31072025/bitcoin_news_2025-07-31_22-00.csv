2025-07-31T19:55:37,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns US May Be on Brink of ‘Another Great Depression,’ Says Bitcoin and These Two Other Assets Are His Top Picks","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki is once again warning that the US economy is on the brink of a catastrophic market crash on par with the Great Depression. In a new thread on the social media platform X, the best-selling personal finance author says that investors should be foregoing stocks and bonds in favor of gold, silver, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) as US national debt continues to mount. According to Kiyosaki, even legendary billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have abandoned stocks and bonds. “Do you have a 401k or IRA filled with stocks? Do you know investment legends Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have sold most if not all of their stocks and bonds? They are both in cash or silver. If you do not know why Buffett and Rogers have sold their stocks and bonds you may want to find out. I sit tight with gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Good luck. We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression. America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long.” In June, Kiyosaki said that he believes silver was undervalued and that it will be one of the assets investors flock to when the US stock and bond markets collapse. “The biggest bargain today is silver. In 2025, silver may 3x. The better news is silver is still 60% under all-time highs… still about $35… while gold and Bitcoin are at or near all-time highs… Silver is priced around $35 an ounce, which means almost everyone anywhere in the world… has a chance to grow richer… while millions grow poorer.” Earlier this month, he predicted that the top crypto asset by market cap could one day reach a staggering price tag of $1 million per token, and thus its current price is a bargain. BTC is trading for $118,080 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day, while silver is valued at $36.69 per ounce.

2025-07-31T19:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $117,000: Urgent Market Update","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $117,000: Urgent Market Update The cryptocurrency market is once again showcasing its inherent volatility, as the Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $117,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $116,935.78 on major exchanges like Binance’s USDT market. This sudden shift has caught the attention of investors worldwide, prompting questions about the underlying causes and what this means for the broader digital asset landscape. Is this a temporary correction, or a sign of deeper market shifts? Understanding the Significance of the Current Bitcoin Price Drop When the Bitcoin price breaches a significant psychological or technical level like $117,000, it often triggers a cascade of reactions across the market. This isn’t just about a number; it’s about market sentiment, investor confidence, and the potential for further price movements. For many, $117,000 may have been viewed as a key support level, a floor below which the asset would ideally not fall. Its breach suggests that selling pressure has intensified, overcoming immediate buying interest. Psychological Impact: Round numbers or previously established resistance/support levels often act as psychological benchmarks for traders. A break below such a level can induce fear and prompt further selling. Technical Analysis: Traders often use these levels to set stop-loss orders. When the price falls below, these orders are triggered, adding to the selling volume and accelerating the downward trend. Market Contagion: Bitcoin’s dominance means its price movements often influence altcoins. A significant drop in BTC can lead to a broader market downturn. Liquidation Events: Leveraged positions in the derivatives market can face liquidation when prices drop sharply, creating additional selling pressure. What Factors Are Influencing the Current Bitcoin Price Action? The cryptocurrency market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from global macroeconomic trends to specific regulatory announcements and even whale movements. Pinpointing a single cause for the current Bitcoin price decline is challenging, but several potential drivers are often at play: Global Macroeconomic Headwinds The broader economic landscape significantly impacts risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Factors such as inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to pull funds from volatile assets and seek safety in more traditional investments or cash. A strengthening US dollar, for instance, often puts pressure on risk assets globally, including Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty and News Regulatory developments, or even the anticipation of them, can have a profound effect on the Bitcoin price . News related to stricter regulations, potential bans, or even delays in favorable regulatory frameworks (like spot Bitcoin ETF approvals) can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among investors, leading to sell-offs. Conversely, positive regulatory clarity can provide a significant boost. Whale Movements and Large Liquidations “Whales” — large holders of Bitcoin — have the capacity to move the market significantly. Large sell orders from whales can overwhelm buying demand, leading to rapid price drops. Furthermore, large-scale liquidations in the derivatives market, where traders use borrowed funds, can amplify price movements. When the Bitcoin price drops to a certain point, these leveraged positions are automatically closed, adding substantial selling pressure. Technical Breakdowns and Market Sentiment Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis plays a crucial role. A break below a key support level, as observed with the $117,000 mark, can signal a bearish trend to technical traders, prompting them to open short positions or exit long ones. Negative news cycles, social media trends, and overall investor sentiment can also create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where fear leads to selling, which in turn fuels more fear. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider When Bitcoin Price Dips? Market downturns can be unsettling, but they also present opportunities for informed investors. Here are some strategies and considerations when the Bitcoin price experiences significant drops: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Before making any investment decisions, it’s paramount to conduct thorough research. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its long-term potential, and the factors that influence its price. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media hype. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Instead of trying to “time the market,” which is notoriously difficult, dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps to average out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk associated with market volatility. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Diversification Never invest more than you can afford to lose. It’s a golden rule in any investment, especially in volatile markets like crypto. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies, can also help mitigate risk. Within crypto, consider diversifying beyond just Bitcoin, though BTC remains the dominant asset. 4. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed Keep abreast of market news, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on every price fluctuation. Understand the difference between short-term noise and long-term trends. Reliable news sources and analytical platforms can provide valuable insights. 5. The “HODL” Mentality (Hold On for Dear Life) For long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, a price dip can be seen as a temporary setback. The “HODL” strategy involves holding onto your assets through market corrections, aiming for significant gains over years rather than weeks or months. The Broader Crypto Landscape: Impact Beyond Bitcoin Price Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its movements often dictate the direction of the entire market. When the Bitcoin price falls, altcoins typically follow suit, often with amplified volatility. This is because Bitcoin serves as the primary trading pair for many altcoins, and investor confidence in the overall crypto market is heavily tied to BTC’s performance. A dip in Bitcoin can lead to a decrease in liquidity across the board, making it harder for altcoins to maintain their value. However, it’s also worth noting that during significant Bitcoin corrections, some investors may reallocate funds to certain altcoins they believe are undervalued or have strong fundamentals, anticipating a quicker rebound. This selective buying can sometimes lead to individual altcoins decoupling from Bitcoin’s immediate price action, though such instances are rare during broad market downturns. Looking Ahead: What Could the Future Hold for the Bitcoin Price ? Predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is impossible, given the dynamic nature of the market. However, market analysts often look at several indicators to gauge potential future movements: Support and Resistance Levels: Traders will be watching to see if Bitcoin finds new support levels below $117,000, or if it manages to reclaim and hold this level. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic stability, inflation rates, and central bank policies will continue to play a significant role. Institutional Adoption: Continued interest and investment from large institutions, corporations, and even sovereign nations could provide long-term stability and upward momentum. Technological Developments: Enhancements to Bitcoin’s network (e.g., Lightning Network for faster transactions) and broader blockchain innovation can bolster its utility and appeal. Regulatory Clarity: Clear, favorable regulations globally would significantly reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant corrections to reach new all-time highs. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this historical context often provides a sense of perspective for long-term holders. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of the Crypto Market The recent dip in the Bitcoin price below $117,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be alarming, they are also a normal part of its evolution. For investors, understanding the multifaceted factors at play — from macroeconomic shifts to technical indicators and market sentiment — is crucial. By adopting strategies like dollar-cost averaging, maintaining a diversified portfolio, and prioritizing informed decision-making over emotional reactions, participants can better navigate these turbulent waters. The crypto journey is often a rollercoaster, but for those with a long-term vision and a robust strategy, the potential rewards can be significant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the Bitcoin price falls below a key level? A1: When the Bitcoin price falls below a significant level like $117,000, it often indicates increased selling pressure and a potential shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. It can trigger stop-loss orders and create a psychological impact among traders, potentially leading to further declines. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A2: Whether it’s a ‘good time’ to buy depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Some investors view dips as buying opportunities (“buy the dip”), while others prefer to wait for signs of recovery. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A3: Bitcoin’s price movements heavily influence the broader cryptocurrency market. As the largest crypto by market cap, its dips often lead to corresponding declines in altcoins, as investor confidence in the overall market tends to follow BTC’s performance. However, some altcoins might occasionally show independent movements. Q4: What are the main reasons for Bitcoin price volatility? A4: Bitcoin price volatility is driven by several factors, including market speculation, regulatory news, macroeconomic trends (like inflation and interest rates), technological developments, large institutional investments, and the actions of major holders (whales). Q5: How can I protect my investments during a market downturn? A5: To protect your investments, consider diversifying your portfolio, setting clear risk management strategies (e.g., stop-loss orders, position sizing), avoiding over-leveraging, and investing only what you can afford to lose. Staying informed and avoiding emotional decisions are also crucial. Q6: Has Bitcoin recovered from similar drops in the past? A6: Yes, Bitcoin has a history of significant price corrections followed by substantial recoveries and new all-time highs. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, this historical resilience is a key aspect often cited by long-term investors.

2025-07-31T19:40:12,"Alarming ChatGPT Privacy Breach: Public AI Chats Indexed by Google","BitcoinWorld Alarming ChatGPT Privacy Breach: Public AI Chats Indexed by Google In an era where artificial intelligence increasingly intertwines with our daily lives, a startling discovery has cast a spotlight on the often-overlooked aspects of digital privacy. It turns out that some of your seemingly private conversations with ChatGPT, when shared, are not remaining as discreet as you might assume. A simple search on Google or Bing, filtered to include URLs from the ChatGPT domain, can unveil a bizarre and sometimes unsettling window into the minds of strangers. This unexpected phenomenon highlights a significant ChatGPT privacy concern that every user should be aware of. Unveiling Public AI Chats: What’s Being Exposed? Imagine the surprise of finding someone’s personal queries about renovating their bathroom, their attempts to grasp complex astrophysics, or even their recipe ideas, all laid bare on a public search engine. These aren’t just abstract data points; they are intimate glimpses into individual lives. The shared links to ChatGPT conversations offer a peculiar insight into human curiosity and vulnerability. The original intent behind ChatGPT’s sharing feature was likely for users to easily share interesting or helpful conversations with friends or colleagues. Users must deliberately click a ‘share’ button on their chat interface and then a ‘create link’ button to generate a shareable URL. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, states that ‘your name, custom instructions, and any messages you add after sharing stay private.’ However, the reality of search engine indexing paints a different picture, leading to unintended public AI chats being discoverable by anyone. Examples of Exposed Data: Personal Career Details: One user’s attempt to rewrite their resume for a specific job application, complete with enough details to potentially locate their LinkedIn profile, reveals a concerning level of personal information. The irony, as noted, is that the individual seemingly did not get the job, making the public exposure even more poignant. Sensitive Inquiries: Some conversations delve into highly sensitive or controversial topics, resembling discussions found on forums known for extreme viewpoints. This underscores the potential for highly personal or even controversial beliefs to become publicly associated with an individual, even if indirectly. Absurd and Trolling Interactions: While some shared chats are mundane, others reveal users engaging in increasingly absurd or trollish questions, such as asking if one can microwave a metal fork (the answer is a resounding ‘no’). These interactions, though humorous to some, still contribute to a public digital footprint that users likely never intended to create. One memorable example cited was an AI-generated guide titled ‘How to Use a Microwave Without Summoning Satan: A Beginner’s Guide.’ The Role of Google Indexing in Data Exposure The core of this issue lies in how search engines, particularly Google, perform Google indexing . When a web page is created and made accessible on the internet, search engine crawlers discover and add it to their index, making it searchable. While OpenAI’s sharing mechanism creates a unique URL, users likely do not anticipate that these links, even if shared privately, could become part of the public index. There’s a subtle but critical distinction here compared to other cloud services. For instance, when people share public links to files from Google Drive with settings like ‘Anyone with link can view,’ Google generally does not surface these links in search results unless they have been explicitly posted or linked on other public, trusted websites. This implies a level of gatekeeping or discernment. User Expectation vs. Indexing Reality The discrepancy between what users expect when sharing a ChatGPT link and what actually happens with search engine indexing is a significant point of concern. Here’s a quick comparison: Aspect User Expectation (when sharing ChatGPT link) Indexing Reality (for shared ChatGPT links) Audience Only those with the direct link. Anyone using a search engine, potentially globally. Privacy Statement OpenAI states name, custom instructions, and new messages stay private. The entire shared chat log becomes publicly discoverable. Discoverability Low, unless explicitly published elsewhere. High, if the link is discovered by search engine crawlers. Control User controls who receives the link. Search engines control indexing once link is public. OpenAI did not provide comment on this matter prior to the original publication. A Google spokesperson clarified their position, stating, ‘Neither Google nor any other search engine controls what pages are made public on the web. Publishers of these pages have full control over whether they are indexed by search engines.’ This statement places the onus on the content publisher – in this case, effectively OpenAI for hosting the shareable content, and indirectly, the user for making the content shareable. The Alarming Reality of User Data Exposure The implications of such widespread user data exposure are profound. While a single chat about astrophysics might seem harmless, the cumulative effect of many such public conversations can paint a detailed, potentially compromising, picture of an individual. This isn’t just about embarrassing queries; it’s about the inadvertent leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal contexts. For instance, if someone shares a chat where they discuss specific health symptoms, financial questions, or unique personal circumstances, and that chat is indexed, it becomes a permanent part of their digital footprint, accessible to anyone with the right search query. This can lead to: Identity Tracing: As seen with the LinkedIn example, seemingly innocuous details can be pieced together to identify individuals. Privacy Breaches: Sensitive personal thoughts, problems, or professional queries become public knowledge. Reputational Damage: Conversations, even those meant as jokes or experiments, can be taken out of context and used to form negative perceptions. Security Risks: While direct financial data might not be in the chats, patterns of behavior or personal vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors. This situation underscores the critical need for users to understand the full scope of what ‘sharing’ means in the digital realm, especially when dealing with AI platforms that process vast amounts of personal text. Safeguarding Your AI Data Security: Practical Steps Given the revelations about Google indexing of shared ChatGPT conversations, it’s more important than ever for users to adopt a proactive approach to their AI data security . While AI platforms continue to evolve, the responsibility for personal data protection largely falls on the user. Actionable Advice for Protecting Your AI Interactions: Be Mindful of the ‘Share’ Button: Treat the ‘share’ feature on ChatGPT (and similar AI platforms) as a public publishing tool. Assume that anything you share could potentially be indexed by search engines and become publicly accessible. Only share conversations that you are comfortable with being seen by anyone. Review Content Before Sharing: Before clicking ‘create link,’ carefully review the entire conversation for any personal details, sensitive information, or anything that could be used to identify you or others. Edit or delete parts of the conversation if necessary. Avoid Including PII: Refrain from inputting personally identifiable information (PII) such as your full name, address, phone number, specific job details, or unique personal circumstances into AI conversations, especially if there’s any chance you might share them. Understand Platform Privacy Policies: Take the time to read and understand the privacy policies and terms of service for any AI tool you use. Look for specifics on data retention, sharing, and indexing practices. Regularly Check Your Digital Footprint: Periodically search for your name or unique online identifiers on search engines to see what information about you is publicly available. This includes searching for ‘site:chat.openai.com [your name/keywords]’ if you’ve ever shared chats. Consider Anonymity Tools: For highly sensitive inquiries, consider using AI tools that prioritize privacy or offer anonymous modes, if available. Beyond ChatGPT: Broader Implications for AI Data Security This incident with ChatGPT’s shared conversations serves as a potent reminder of the broader challenges in AI data security . As AI models become more sophisticated and integrated into various applications, the volume of sensitive data they process will only increase. This necessitates a robust framework for data governance, not just from the AI developers but also from regulatory bodies and users themselves. The evolving landscape of digital privacy demands clearer communication from technology companies about how user-generated content is handled, especially when sharing features are involved. It also calls for greater awareness among users about the implications of their digital actions. The lines between ‘private’ and ‘public’ are constantly blurring in the digital world, and incidents like this highlight the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation. Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025: A Glimpse into the Future of Tech While navigating the complexities of AI privacy, the broader tech world continues its rapid evolution. Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 offer a vital platform for industry leaders to discuss these very challenges and innovations.

Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Frontier with Awareness The revelation that public AI chats from ChatGPT are being indexed by search engines like Google is a significant wake-up call regarding digital privacy. It underscores that even seemingly innocuous actions, like clicking a ‘share’ button, can have unforeseen consequences, leading to unwanted user data exposure . While AI platforms provide incredible utility, they also demand a higher level of awareness and caution from their users. Protecting your ChatGPT privacy and ensuring robust AI data security in the age of generative AI is a shared responsibility. Users must be diligent about what they share and how they interact with these powerful tools, while developers must continue to innovate with user privacy at the forefront.

2025-07-31T19:19:10,"SEC’s Crypto ETF Rule Marks Structural Shift, Not Retail Gamechanger","A Back-End Upgrade, Not a Front-End Revolution The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted on a structural adjustment allowing crypto ETFs to support in-kind creations and redemptions — a back-end upgrade that serves institutional activity over retail availability, according to experts. Rather than trading in cash for ETF shares, asset managers can now trade actual Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) directly for ETF shares. The mechanism reduces conversion costs, enhances accuracy in pricing, and streamlines business activities for ETF providers. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to it as “a plumbing fix,” insisting that it doesn’t change how individual investors engage with crypto funds. “This does not mean retail can swap IBIT for actual bitcoin,” he further added. Bitwise Pioneers the Way Bitwise Asset Management was the initial U.S. issuer to roll out in-kind redemptions following the SEC’s July 29 ruling. The firm said that both of its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs would begin to offer this structure simultaneously. “It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas added. Previous SEC leadership, including Gary Gensler, had opposed in-kind models because of perceived risks around where the crypto assets came from. Toward Traditional Market Parity The structural upgrade brings crypto ETFs more in line with the structure of traditional exchange-traded products. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro stated that it puts crypto funds in line with institutional-grade ETF structure. 21Shares’ Federico Brokate referred to the move as fundamental to further integration between crypto and the mainstream financial system. ETFs Keep Adding Up Bitcoin The SEC decision comes on the heels of continuous growth in crypto ETF holdings. As of July 31, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over 1.29 million BTC — approximately 6.18% of circulating supply. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leads the pack with 740,601 BTC worth nearly $88 billion.

2025-07-31T19:07:40,"Altcoin Season Flickers as Cardano, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin Command $1.7B Daily Volume","The crypto market enters August 2025 with traders debating whether a muted altcoin season is underway. While the Altcoin Season Index sits below 40, suggesting Bitcoin dominance remains strong, selective altcoins are showing renewed traction. Three tokens stand out in this cycle: Cardano, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin. Each reflects a different strand of the current rotation, blending utility, speculation, and liquidity in a cautious market. Cardano Price Holds Amid Ecosystem Growth Cardano is currently trading at $0.77 , giving ADA a market cap of about $27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily trading volume remains above $1.1 billion, showing that liquidity is intact despite the broader altseason index indicating only limited participation. Cardano’s ecosystem is a key driver. Hydra Layer‑2 scaling is live, and the Mithril fast‑sync protocol continues to roll out, designed to reduce node sync times. Governance through the Voltaire upgrade is also progressing, offering ADA holders more influence over treasury allocation. Stablecoin activity has also helped sustain interest. Both Djed and USDA remain active on Cardano, expanding liquidity for DeFi applications. DeFiLlama reports a total value locked of nearly $470 million, marking steady growth through July. Social traction reinforces the picture. LunarCrush data shows steady mentions through July, reflecting renewed retail engagement. These factors together have kept ADA resilient in an otherwise selective altcoin season. Dogwifhat Price Reflects Altcoin Season Dogwifhat’s price sits at roughly $0.96, giving the token a market cap of nearly $964 million. Trading volume has held above $320 million over the past 24 hours, based on CoinMarketCap. For a meme coin launched only in 2023, those figures show persistent speculative activity. Dogwifhat Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Dogwifhat thrives on its role in meme trading cycles. Whale wallets remain active, and their presence across Solana‑based exchanges ensures strong liquidity. While the token has no utility functions beyond trading, its ability to sustain volume and engagement shows its position as a meme‑driven liquidity hub. Traders note that meme assets often gain visibility during altseason rotations, even when the broader market remains cautious. Dogwifhat fits this pattern, attracting attention in a muted environment while contributing to the idea that altcoin season may be forming at the margins. Fartcoin Price Gains on Liquidity Momentum Fartcoin’s price is around $1.05 , supported by a $1.05 billion market cap and $280 million in 24‑hour volume. Fartcoin entered the market as a parody token but has since built consistent liquidity across decentralized exchanges. Its verified contract and strong daily turnover differentiate it from short‑lived meme projects. Weekly performance has also shown steady inflows, supported by active Telegram communities and mentions on LunarCrush. Though lacking functional use cases, its ability to draw liquidity has made it part of altseason conversations, especially among traders seeking high‑beta opportunities when Bitcoin dominance weakens. Altseason Remains Uneven The Altcoin Season Index remains below the threshold of 75 that defines a broad altcoin season. At around 38, the current reading points to selective rotation rather than widespread participation. Bitcoin dominance, above 60% per TradingView’s BTC.D chart, reinforces that most capital remains concentrated in BTC. Bitcoin Dominance (Source: TradingView) Yet the persistence of activity in ADA, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin suggests that even in a shallow altseason, traders are finding ways to express risk appetite. Cardano represents a long‑standing utility‑driven play, while Dogwifhat and Fartcoin show the meme and liquidity side of speculative markets. If ETF inflows and network upgrades continue to support capital allocation, the current altcoin season could deepen into Q3 and Q4. For now, attention is selective. Tokens like ADA, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin remain in rotation, showing how narrative, liquidity, and engagement define momentum even when broader altseason signs stay muted.

2025-07-31T19:00:23,"Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over? Analyst Calls 50% Crash To $60,000","In a post shared on TradingView, crypto analyst Xanrox argues that the current bullish cycle is nearly over, pointing to a potential downtrend that would see the Bitcoin price crash to $60,000. This analysis comes as Bitcoin is trading within a very quiet phase, prompting many crypto traders and crypto analysts to start reassessing its next direction. Xanrox Predicts Bitcoin Top At $122,000 And Crash To $60,000 The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been hovering just above the $118,000 price level for several days now, struggling to break decisively above this zone but also showing no major signs of a breakdown. Despite this consolidation, market sentiment remains upbeat. Related Reading: This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here’s What It’s Saying Now The crypto fear and greed index continues to flash “greed,” and most analysts still argue that Bitcoin is setting up for another leg upward. However, an interesting technical outlook challenges this bullish consensus and issues a crash warning. Notably, crypto analyst Xanrox identified a sell signal on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart after Bitcoin reached the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and touched the long-term 2017–2021–2025 trendline, with the latest touch of the trendline aligning to Bitcoin’s recent all-time high at $122,800. According to him, the most recent touch of this trendline might be the top of the current cycle. Furthermore, he noted that the Elliott Wave structure has now completed Wave 5 of a rising wedge and a larger Wave 5 impulse move. As such, a corrective phase is about to start. What’s Next For Bitcoin? As shown in the chart below, the next major move could be at least a 50% decline, with Bitcoin dropping to around $60,000 by 2026. This projection is based on previous price action, where Bitcoin embarked on 84% and 77% price crashes after touching the trendline in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The technical setup also aligns with statistical data that shows August and September historically bring increased selling pressure. Xanrox noted that while traders can wait for further confirmation, such as a break below the 50-week moving average, he personally believes the top is already in. Large institutions and professional investors pay close attention to the 20, 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages.

Bitcoin’s current structure is still showing strength on higher timeframes, and several other analysts see the recent consolidation between $117,000 and $119,000 as a base for continuation toward $130,000 and beyond. The lack of major sell-side volume, the firm hold above the $118,000 price level and the 50-week moving average, and bullish indicators across altcoins like Ethereum are on-chain signals that the Bitcoin price still has more room to run before it reaches a peak price this cycle.
