2025-07-30T22:30:00,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 30 July ‚Äì XRP, Solana, Pepe","Crypto progenitor Bitcoin surged to a historic price peak of $122,838 just over a fortnight ago, triggering a fresh wave of bullish sentiment among traders. Although it has since experienced a slight retracement of 4.2%, enthusiasm remains high, with many speculating that another breakout could be imminent as Bitcoin continues to hold strong near its top range. The rapid rally in Bitcoin has also buoyed many top altcoins and leading meme coins . Over the past year, tokens such as XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have notched new all-time highs, suggesting robust confidence in the broader market trajectory. Currently, the total cryptocurrency market cap hovers around the $4 trillion mark. A 5.6% dip in the last 24 hours reflects a cooling-off period, hinting at consolidation after a stretch of sustained gains. With growing expectations of a major bull market, investor focus is shifting toward cryptocurrency that could surpass their former price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Transactions Crypto Posts a Blistering Price Run This Year On July 18, Ripple‚Äôs XRP achieved a new peak at $3.65, beating its 2018 high of $3.40. It now trades near $3.25‚Äîdown 10.7% from its top but up 2.2% in the past 24 hours‚Äîindicating a period of consolidation. XRP‚Äôs real-time settlements, ultra-low transaction costs, and ability to handle global transfers without intermediaries have made it an attractive choice for institutions. The token‚Äôs use by organizations like the United Nations underscores its credibility. A major milestone occurred in 2023 when a U.S. court declared that XRP‚Äôs retail transactions did not fall under securities laws. By 2025, with regulatory battles behind it, XRP entered a more stable and attractive phase for institutional investors. That clarity has translated into massive gains‚ÄîXRP has surged more than 387% over the past year, far outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 77% growth during the same time frame. Technical indicators show a cooling RSI, which fell from 86 last week to 56 now. Following a 42% rally on last month‚Äôs price‚Äîwell ahead of Bitcoin‚Äôs 9% increase in thirty days‚Äîprofit-taking is expected to lead to more short-term selling, potentially extending into the weekend. Still, this could offer a strong reentry point for buyers. Over the past day, XRP has slipped 2.7%, and further softening is possible until the RSI reaches the neutral 50 mark and/or the price converges with its 30-day moving average. However, downside risk appears limited, with strong support near the former resistance level of $3. XRP‚Äôs bullish flag formation, developed between late 2024 and early April, may foreshadow a rise toward the $4 level later in the year. Solana ($SOL): Fast, Scalable Ethereum Contender Set for New Crypto Price Highs Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its status as a premier smart contract platform, praised for blazing transaction speeds and minimal fees. With a market cap exceeding $95.4 billion and a TVL over $9.7 billion (per DeFiLlama), Solana has become a major player in the DeFi space. Speculation is growing that Solana could be next in line for a spot ETF, following the approval of similar funds for Bitcoin and Ethereum. If greenlit, this could usher in substantial institutional capital and further validate Solana‚Äôs status as a top-tier blockchain. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Donald Trump recently floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Crypto Reserve, a concept that would involve holding seized assets from enforcement actions. Price-wise, SOL has recovered from its April dip to $100, following its earlier surge to $250 in February. Currently priced at $179, it has climbed 18.3% over the past month. Its RSI has cooled from 82 to 52, suggesting that while some profit-taking is underway, the coin remains in a healthy range. Support levels around $150 provide a buffer, and if SOL can breach key resistance at $200 and $250, the path may be clear to test its all-time high of $293.31‚Äîor potentially move beyond $300 by fall. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Set for a Comeback Since debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly climbed into the top three meme coins by market cap, drawing on the viral power of its namesake frog from Matt Furie‚Äôs artwork. Its meteoric rise has spawned many imitators, but none have matched its trajectory. With a peak valuation exceeding $4.7 billion and a brief stint as Elon Musk‚Äôs profile avatar, Pepe has become a cultural mainstay in the crypto meme space. Currently valued at around $0.00001123, the coin has gained 16% in the past month but remains 60% off its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. A falling wedge pattern formed earlier this year suggests a bullish reversal may be on the horizon. Its RSI has eased to 42, indicating that a recent selloff cycle is almost coming to an end. This means Pepe‚Äôs price by the weekend could offer an attractive buying opportunity for both new entrants and bulls. While the broader market declined by 5.7% to $3.92 trillion, Pepe has shown resilience with a 4% drop. This suggests that high-cap meme coins like PEPE are beginning to exhibit price behavior similar to blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Solana. As the market eyes a potential late-summer rally, Pepe holders remain optimistic that renewed momentum and improving macro conditions could spark a fresh upswing. Snorter ($SNORT): A Meme Coin with a Suite of Crypto Trading Tools‚ÄîAnd an Attractive Fixed Presale Price For investors eager to catch the next breakout project, identifying early-stage opportunities is critical. Snorter ($SNORT) , a new token built on Solana, combines meme coin appeal with real-world functionality through its integrated crypto trading bot.

Users have reported ‚Äúunexpected error sending order‚Äù messages. Unlike yesterday, the team has explained that the problem was due to API congestion, not an outage. The quick fix and lack of exploit have calmed most users but orders are still being processed with delays. In addition, liquidity and volume are still down, and the price dipped 5% post yesterday‚Äôs incident. Hyperliquid‚Äôs native token fell by 3.75% to $42.59. At the time of writing, the token continues its downward trend, trading at around $42.10, a drop of more than 2.27% in the last 24 hours. Hyperliquid plan to pay refunds Hyperliquid has confirmed it will issue automated refunds to users affected by an API server issue that led to over 30 minutes of trading downtime on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAn update will be shared in the coming days once an appropriate refund methodology has been determined for users impacted by this particular issue,‚Äù the Hyperliquid team wrote on its official Telegram channel on Wednesday. ‚ÄúRefunds will be determined in an automated fashion; impacted users do not need to open a ticket at this time.‚Äù As reported by Cryptopolitan, from 14:10 UTC on Tuesday, several customers started experiencing problems with trade execution. This produced price differences because traders couldn‚Äôt close positions during the delay. Hyperliquid‚Äôs status page didn‚Äôt show the problem at first, but a later update verified the ‚Äúmajor outage‚Äù and said that the cause was a spike in traffic. This was good news to many users who thought that it was a hack or a vulnerability attack. Hyperliquid user loses millions on the platform James Wynn, a crypto trader, has placed large bets on the Hyperliquid perpetual futures exchange, even though he is losing more and more. In the last two weeks, Wynn put more than $1.2 million into Hyperliquid. He lost practically all of his deposits in a series of extremely leveraged trades, and he got liquidated nine times in the process. He bet 10 times what he put in, trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Pepe, and Doge. A trader who uses leverage borrows money to make a bigger stake than the amount they put into the deal at first. If the trade goes bad, the exchange will automatically sell the trader‚Äôs collateral to offset the loss of the leveraged position. Wynn‚Äôs liquidations came after the trader made risky bets that cost him tens of millions of dollars. In total, he has lost over $22 million on one wallet since he started trading on the site. On Tuesday, Wynn finally stopped trading, closing a Pepe long for a loss and withdrawing about $33,000 to Binance.

2025-07-30T22:19:56,"Trump's Top Crypto Guys: U.S. DeFi Will Thrive, Assures Bitcoin Reserve Is Coming","President Donald Trump's crypto working group finally issued its massive report and its pages of U.S. policy recommendations, and two of the people behind that effort told CoinDesk that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols should fare just fine in the administration's vision of the U.S. sector. ""Decentralized protocols can definitely meet the rules of the road,"" said Bo Hines, the executive director for the group of regulators and senior administration officials that collectively issued the 163-page report on Wednesday. In a CoinDesk TV interview with Jennifer Sanasie , Hines and the Treasury Department's Tyler Williams shared some of the highlights of the lengthy report , including its treatment of DeFi. ""We want people innovating and developing here in the U.S.,"" Hines said from the White House, and that requires making sure developers ""feel as if they have the rules of the road laid out for them."" Hines said the administration has tried to take ""immense steps to do that and offer guidance."" He said Treasury's removal of Tornado Cash sanctions should show ""we understand how important immutable smart contracts are in open source code."" Williams added that the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act passed recently by the House of Representatives, has already made strides to ensure the industry would have an avenue for complying with the Bank Secrecy Act. He said this week's report delves into some of the ground already covered by lawmakers. The report was embraced by industry insiders as another step forward in Trump's aggressive crypto agenda, and Hines called it ""probably the most comprehensive piece of work on digital assets ever produced, and I don't think that should be lost on anyone."" Virtually all of the policy initiatives and efforts described in its pages are already familiar to the dozens of crypto lobbyists working the front lines in Washington, so it didn't bring any surprise initiatives. ""While many of the policy items that you'll see are not unfamiliar to the audience and to the public, I think we put a little bit more meat on the bones in terms of the action items we wanna see,"" Williams said. One detail that went missing in the report was a description of the next steps for the so-called Bitcoin Strategic Reserve contemplated by the administration, based on an order from Trump that such a stockpile should be initiated. Hines, who has been asked similar questions about the reserve for months without offering a significant update, said, ""People will be very pleased with what we come up with."" ""There's an infrastructure piece of this, as well, and Treasury's working diligently on that, making sure everything's set up properly, so that we can move forward in the best way possible."" At the White House's Wednesday launch of the report, the administration invited industry representatives to share the moment. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber that lobbies in Washington on crypto policy, said about 40 people attended alongside senior officials from the administration, including Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, crypto czar David Sacks, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Carbone said in a memo on the event that the officials were ""gracious in thanking the industry voices and experts who helped contribute to this comprehensive report,"" which he said included several from his organization.

2025-07-30T22:00:35,"Bet $5, Get $20 Instantly ‚Äì Why Spartans Beats Betway and Stake as the Top Online Betting Site","Stake is attracting attention with its regional perks and crypto-first setup, while Betway continues to lock in loyal users through sponsorships and a global sportsbook. Both have built solid reputations, but when it comes to speed, game selection, and next-gen crypto features, it might be time to look beyond the usual picks. That‚Äôs where Spartans.com is starting to flip the script. Spartans isn‚Äôt just another platform on the list, it‚Äôs built for fast-action crypto bettors who want instant withdrawals, 5,963+ games, and no app needed. From high-speed crash games to a powerful affiliate program and a Lamborghini giveaway, Spartans are checking boxes that older brands ignore. If you‚Äôre comparing the top online betting site options in 2025, this one‚Äôs hard to ignore. Let‚Äôs break down how it stacks up against Stake and Betway. Crypto Betting Meets Local Flavor: What‚Äôs Working for Stake Stake has carved out its space in the LatAm betting scene by blending its global crypto-first model with region-specific features. The site supports BTC, ETH, and other major cryptocurrencies for deposits and withdrawals, giving users fast and flexible access. What sets Stake apart is its localized approach, Spanish-language customer support, region-specific promotions, and betting options tied to Colombian football leagues. These tweaks make the platform feel familiar to local users, not just a direct copy of the international version. That said, there‚Äôs a growing sense that the platform might be too dependent on its parent model. Game variety hasn‚Äôt expanded in any noticeable way for Colombian audiences, and crypto withdrawals, while decent in speed, still fall short of instant payouts offered elsewhere. Live support response times can also be inconsistent. While it delivers on basics like fast-loading casino games and clean UI, Stake doesn‚Äôt go the extra mile on local tournaments or personalized user experiences. Newer platforms are stepping in with faster payouts and tailored incentives, raising the bar on what users now expect from crypto betting sites. Big Name, Familiar Game: Where Betway Wins and Lags Betway has long been one of the go-to names for sports betting, known for its Premier League partnerships, wide sportsbook, and decent odds. It covers everything from cricket and football to esports, and offers flexible betting options like build-a-bet, cash-out, and live play. In Latin America, it‚Äôs built strong recognition through ad placements and sponsorships, and its interface is easy to use even for first-timers. But while it‚Äôs trusted, it‚Äôs starting to feel a little too comfortable in its own lane. Despite its scale, Betway still lags on crypto integration. There‚Äôs no support for Bitcoin, ETH, or USDT, even as more users shift to faster, anonymous transactions. Withdrawals through traditional banking channels can take up to 48 hours, and the site‚Äôs promos are often geared toward long-time users rather than new signups. It‚Äôs solid and dependable, but it‚Äôs playing it safe, especially when newer platforms are prioritizing speed, crypto, and localized experiences. That gap is exactly where competitors like Spartans.com are starting to take over. No Tiers, No Limits: Spartans Treats Everyone Like a High-Roller Forget grinding for points or climbing confusing VIP ladders, Spartans.com starts rewarding players from day one. A simple $5 deposit unlocks a massive 300% welcome bonus, instantly boosting your bankroll. That‚Äôs followed by a 25% daily reload bonus, no questions asked. You don‚Äôt have to be a high-stakes player or stream for followers to get elite perks. Spartans skips the games and gives real value upfront. This no-strings approach is part of why Spartans is earning a spot as a top online betting site. While other platforms gate rewards behind milestones or influencer deals, Spartans makes everyday players feel like insiders. Whether you‚Äôre playing live roulette, slots, or sports betting, the bonuses apply across the board. And with 5,963 games from 43+ providers, there‚Äôs no shortage of options to use them on. Payments are also built for speed and flexibility. Spartans supports fast crypto payouts in BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, ADA, and AVAX, no card delays or bank hassles. Withdrawals are processed instantly, making it not just rewarding, but refreshingly efficient. Spartans.com is currently accepting new players and building its brand during presale. The platform is running a Lamborghini giveaway and promoting its affiliate program with revenue share, CPA, and hybrid deals. If you‚Äôre looking for a top online betting site that skips the fluff and brings bonuses upfront, Spartans is the one to watch. Summing Up Stake continues to do well in Latin America, with crypto options and football-centric promotions tailored for local users. But it‚Äôs starting to feel a bit too familiar, offering no major edge over the main Stake brand. Betway keeps its global reputation strong with wide coverage and decent promos, but some users are growing tired of its tiered loyalty model and slow withdrawals in certain markets. This is where Spartans.com flips the script. With 300% welcome bonuses and daily reloads available from day one, there‚Äôs no waiting, no hoops, just instant perks. Players don‚Äôt need VIP status to feel valued. That‚Äôs what makes Spartans more than just another top online betting site. It brings the rewards straight to everyone, backed by fast crypto payouts and thousands of games. If you‚Äôre done with grind-to-earn loyalty programs, Spartans may be the top online betting site you‚Äôve been looking for.

2025-07-30T22:00:00,"Cardano Price Prediction: Hoskinson Says ADA Can Outperform Bitcoin ‚Äì Analyst Says Breakout Coming Soon","Cardano (ADA) has gone down by 11.1% in the past 7 days as the latest rally that pushed this token above $0.80 has taken a breather. However, the latest comments from this project‚Äôs founder support a bullish Cardano price prediction. In an interview with the founder of Blockworks Research, Jason Yanowitz, Charles Hoskinson pointed out why ADA is right now a better investment than Bitcoin (BTC). Really enjoyed this conversation with @IOHK_Charles We covered a lot: politics, psychedelics, his bison + black hawk, his alien search, Japan‚Äôs influence on Cardano, personal security, and of course‚Ä¶ Why he believes ADA is a better investment than BTC. pic.twitter.com/rB26dLLVpP ‚Äî Yano (@JasonYanowitz) July 28, 2025 Hoskinson emphasized that real money in crypto is made when you can ‚Äúpredict the future.‚Äù Whoever can predict where the market or the industry is going in the next 10 years will stand a much better chance of reaping life-changing returns. When it comes to ADA, Hoskinson said that the biggest potential comes from acknowledging the needs of the private sector to launch real-world assets (RWA). This is what Cardano is doing right now, anticipating these needs to become the go-to blockchain for companies to launch their assets and raise capital in the future. ‚ÄúHow far can BTC go?‚Äù Hoskinson asked. ‚ÄúMaybe to a million‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs 10X. ADA can go 100X, 1000X. We are not second-class citizens. Cardano does substantially more [than the Bitcoin network],‚Äù he stressed. Do you agree with Hoskinson‚Äôs bullish Cardano price prediction ? Cardano Price Prediction: Here‚Äôs How ADA‚Äôs Path to $1 Could Look Like Looking at the daily chart, we can see a couple of paths that ADA could take from here based on potential trend line supports that have emerged from the latest uptrend. Selling pressure rose at $0.90 and ADA has retreated strongly from that level. This was a much-needed breather as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had already climbed to extreme overbought levels at 83. Now we could see ADA dropping to TL1 or TL2, which means a move to around $0.72 and $0.65 in the next few days before the token resumes its upward path. After that, the next stop could be the $1.1 level, which would result in a strong upside potential of around 50% to 70% depending on your entry price. This bullish Cardano price prediction sees a last line of defense at $0.615. As long as the price holds above this mark, these short-term targets would still be attainable. If you want to profit from ADA‚Äôs climb to $1, you can turn to one of the most user-friendly crypto futures trading platforms nowadays ‚Äì CoinFutures. CoinFutures Offers 1000X Leverage and Auto-Trading Features CoinFutures works like a prediction market.

2025-07-30T22:00:00,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 602 Million SHIB Tokens Burned in One Go ‚Äì Could This Be the First Step Toward $1 SHIB?","Shiba Inu (SHIB) is among the worst-performing tokens in the meme coin space this year, with year-to-date losses of 40%. However, after millions of tokens were burned in just a few hours, there could be a reason to support a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction. The Shiba Inu blockchain is designed to automatically send a portion of Shiba Inu‚Äôs transaction fees in SHIB to a burn wallet to reduce the token‚Äôs circulating supply. ShibBurn is a site that tracks how many SHIB tokens are burned in real time. Two days ago, a total of 602 million SHIB were burned in just a few transactions. Surprisingly, 600 million were out in just one single transfer. Although this amount corresponds to just $7,633 worth of SHIB, it represented a major climb compared to previous days and could be indicative that network activity is increasing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the meme coins with the strongest ecosystem in the space and a large fan base. Despite the token‚Äôs latest underwhelming performance, SHIB is still the second most valuable meme coin with a market cap of $7.5 billion. Hence, this token still has the potential to deliver sizable gains in the long term. Maybe not a move to $1, but a retest of its all-time high during this cycle if altcoin season kicks off. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Breaks Below Key Support‚ÄîCan It Recover? The daily chart shows that SHIB has broken a key trend line support in the past couple of days. The token has dropped by 5% in the past 24 hours, but trading volumes have retreated by 13%, meaning that the selling pressure is still not that strong. This bearish breakout could be an early sign that the market is ready for a much more pronounced correction that could push SHIB to $0.00001050 within the next few days. Meanwhile, if the $0.00001200 level acts as a strong support for this latest downtrend, this would support a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction as it could provide the necessary strength to push SHIB back to the $0.00001600 level and possibly higher. SHIB‚Äôs upside potential at this point could be limited. However, the best crypto presales like Token6900 (T) could deliver some interesting returns to early buyers as investors are currently scouting for the next crypto to 10X during this bullish cycle. Token6900 (T6900) Reminds Investors of a Better Time and Gives Them a New Reason to Believe The 2000s were a ‚Äògolden era‚Äô where our biggest worries were who made it to MTV‚Äôs top 20 most-watched videos list. Then came the Fed and screwed everything with its loose monetary policy. Now, rent prices have three zeros in most zip codes and Bitcoin (BTC) is more valuable than most S&P 500 companies. Token6900 (T6900) embodies a generation‚Äôs outcry. It is the purest form of a meme coin as it has no roadmap, makes no promises, and offers no incentives whatsoever. Fueled by raw ‚Äúvibe liquidity.‚Äù Everything that Wall Street isn‚Äôt, T6900 is. It makes no sense because it shouldn‚Äôt. Stop looking at charts all day and setting up alerts to check the last Naval tweet. Believe in something. To buy T6900, simply head to the Token6900 website . Just connect your crypto wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ) and swap ETH or USDT or use a bank card to invest.
