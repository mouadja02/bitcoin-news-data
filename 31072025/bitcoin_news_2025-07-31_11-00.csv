2025-07-31T08:50:11,"US Dollar Strength Unleashes Crucial Shifts in Forex Market","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Strength Unleashes Crucial Shifts in Forex Market The US Dollar’s recent resurgence, marking its first monthly gain this year, has sent palpable ripples across global financial markets. For anyone navigating the complex world of cryptocurrencies, this isn’t just a distant currency headline; it’s a crucial signal. A stronger US Dollar strength often correlates with a tougher environment for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, making understanding its underlying drivers paramount. Let’s delve into what’s propelling the greenback forward and what it means for your portfolio. Understanding the Recent US Dollar Strength : What’s Driving It? The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, has demonstrated remarkable resilience. After a period of weakness, its recent climb signifies a significant shift in market sentiment. But what exactly is fueling this newfound vigor? Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance on monetary policy, coupled with expectations of further rate hikes, makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher yields compared to other major economies. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions, the US Dollar traditionally serves as a safe-haven asset. Investors flock to its perceived stability, pushing its value higher. Economic Resilience: Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the US economy has shown signs of robustness, particularly in the labor market. This relative strength compared to some other developed nations attracts capital inflows. Liquidity: The dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency ensures deep liquidity, making it easy for large institutions to move capital in and out, further supporting its demand. Imagine a scenario where global growth concerns are rising, and other major economies face headwinds. In such an environment, the dollar becomes a beacon for capital, drawing funds from less stable regions and boosting its valuation. Jerome Powell Hawkish Tone: A Deep Dive into Fed’s Stance A primary catalyst for the dollar’s recent rally has been the unwavering, indeed, Jerome Powell hawkish rhetoric. The Federal Reserve Chair has consistently emphasized the central bank’s commitment to taming inflation, even if it means prolonged periods of restrictive monetary policy. His recent comments have left little doubt about the Fed’s resolve. Key takeaways from Powell’s recent statements include: Inflation Fight Remains Priority: Powell reiterated that inflation remains too high and the Fed is far from declaring victory. He signaled a willingness to keep rates elevated for an extended period to ensure inflation returns to the 2% target. ‘Higher for Longer’ Narrative: This phrase has become synonymous with the Fed’s current approach. It suggests that even if rate hikes pause, a quick pivot to rate cuts is unlikely. This prolonged period of high rates supports the dollar. Data-Dependent Decisions: While committed to fighting inflation, Powell stressed that future policy decisions would be data-dependent, implying flexibility but leaning towards continued vigilance. Risks of Easing Prematurely: The Fed Chair has warned against the dangers of easing policy too soon, which could lead to a resurgence of inflationary pressures, necessitating even more aggressive action later. This steadfast commitment to tightening, even as some other central banks show signs of wavering, creates a significant divergence in monetary policy, making the dollar more appealing to global investors. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Hike Expectations Impact Markets The anticipation of continued interest rate hike s by the Federal Reserve sends powerful signals across all asset classes. Higher interest rates in the US have a multifaceted impact: Impact on Currencies: When the Fed raises rates, it increases the yield on dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds. This makes the dollar more attractive to foreign investors, increasing demand for the currency and pushing its value up relative to others. This dynamic is clearly visible in pairs like EUR/USD and JPY/USD, where the dollar has gained ground. Impact on Equities: Higher interest rates generally lead to higher borrowing costs for companies, which can squeeze profit margins. This can make equity investments less attractive, especially for growth stocks that rely on future earnings. Furthermore, a stronger dollar can negatively impact the earnings of US multinational corporations that derive a significant portion of their revenue from overseas. Impact on Commodities: Commodities, often priced in US Dollars (e.g., oil, gold), tend to become more expensive for holders of other currencies when the dollar strengthens. This can dampen demand and put downward pressure on commodity prices. Gold, traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, often struggles in a strong dollar, high-interest-rate environment. Impact on Cryptocurrencies: The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, has shown a historical inverse correlation with the DXY. When the dollar strengthens due to hawkish Fed policy and rising interest rates, risk assets like crypto often face headwinds. Investors may rotate out of speculative assets into safer, yield-bearing dollar assets. This correlation is not always absolute but remains a significant factor for crypto investors to monitor. Navigating the Current Forex Market Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges The current environment, marked by significant Forex market volatility and a strengthening dollar, presents both opportunities and challenges for investors and businesses alike. Opportunities: Yield Seeking: Investors can find attractive yields in US dollar-denominated bonds and money market funds. Import Advantages: For US companies and consumers, a stronger dollar means imported goods and services become cheaper, potentially easing some inflationary pressures. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with international operations can use the current environment to re-evaluate and adjust their currency hedging strategies to mitigate risks from adverse currency movements. Challenges: Export Competitiveness: A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially hurting the competitiveness of American companies in global markets. Emerging Market Debt: Many emerging market countries hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A strengthening dollar makes it more expensive for these nations to service their debts, increasing the risk of financial instability. Reduced Foreign Earnings: US companies with substantial international operations will see their foreign earnings translated into fewer dollars, impacting their overall profitability. Pressure on Risk Assets: As discussed, the dollar’s strength can continue to exert pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, making it a challenging environment for speculative investments. Understanding these dynamics is vital for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading currencies, investing in global stocks, or holding digital assets. Broader Implications: Analyzing the Global Economic Impact The sustained US Dollar strength and the Fed’s hawkish stance have profound implications for the global economic impact . It’s not just about currency valuations; it’s about trade balances, capital flows, and the overall health of economies worldwide. Consider these broader effects: Inflation Export: A stronger dollar can ‘export’ inflation to other countries. As imports become cheaper in the US, other nations might experience reduced demand for their exports, leading to lower prices there. Conversely, for countries whose currencies have weakened against the dollar, their dollar-denominated imports (like oil) become more expensive, fueling their domestic inflation. Capital Flight: Higher US interest rates can trigger capital flight from emerging markets. Investors may pull funds out of these economies to chase higher, safer yields in the US, potentially destabilizing their financial systems and currency values. Debt Crisis Risks: For countries with large dollar-denominated debts, a stronger dollar makes these repayments more burdensome, increasing the risk of sovereign debt crises. This is a significant concern for many developing nations. Global Growth Slowdown: The combined effect of higher borrowing costs globally (as other central banks may follow the Fed’s lead), reduced trade competitiveness, and capital outflows can contribute to a broader slowdown in global economic growth. The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that the Fed’s policy decisions and the dollar’s performance reverberate far beyond US borders, shaping economic trajectories for years to come. Conclusion: Navigating the Strong Dollar Era The US Dollar’s first monthly gain this year, driven by a resolutely Jerome Powell hawkish Federal Reserve and the expectation of further interest rate hike s, marks a significant shift in the global financial landscape. This US Dollar strength is not merely a statistical anomaly; it is a powerful force reshaping the Forex market and casting a long shadow over the global economic impact . For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro trends is paramount. A strong dollar environment typically implies tighter liquidity and a more cautious approach to risk assets. While past performance is not indicative of future results, historical correlations suggest that a surging dollar often presents headwinds for digital currencies. Monitoring Fed commentary, global inflation data, and DXY movements will be crucial for making informed investment decisions in the months ahead. The era of cheap money may be receding, and with it, the dynamics of global finance are undergoing a profound transformation.

2025-07-31T08:40:11,"MicroStrategy’s Alarming Stock Slide: Why Put Options Are Surging","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy’s Alarming Stock Slide: Why Put Options Are Surging In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, certain events send ripples across both markets. Recently, one such event has captivated attention: the significant slide in MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, a company synonymous with corporate Bitcoin holdings. This downturn has triggered an intriguing surge in demand for put options, signaling a growing wave of bearish sentiment among investors. What exactly is driving this trend, and what does it mean for the broader market? What’s Driving the Surge in MicroStrategy Put Options? MicroStrategy , once known primarily for its business intelligence software, has become the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, effectively transforming its stock into a proxy for the leading cryptocurrency. This unique position means its stock price often mirrors Bitcoin’s volatility, amplifying both its upsides and its downsides. Recent weeks have seen MSTR’s stock price tumble by over 14%, reaching approximately $292. This sharp decline has not gone unnoticed by the options market. Data reported by CoinDesk indicates a dramatic increase in the demand for put options on MicroStrategy stock. Put options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. They are typically bought by investors who anticipate a price decline and wish to profit from it or hedge against potential losses. The intensity of this bearish sentiment is further highlighted by the one-year put-call skew, which soared to 3.6%. This figure represents its highest point since April 17, indicating a significant preference for puts over calls. A rising put-call skew suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, reflecting deep concerns about the stock’s future performance. Understanding Put Options and Bearish Sentiment for MicroStrategy To truly grasp the implications of the current situation, it’s essential to understand the mechanics of put options and what a high put-call skew signifies: Put Options Explained: Imagine you own a stock, and you’re worried its price might drop. You can buy a put option, which acts like an insurance policy. If the stock price falls below your chosen strike price, you can ‘put’ (sell) your shares at that higher, agreed-upon price, limiting your losses. Speculators also buy puts if they simply believe a stock will fall, hoping to profit from the decline. Call Options Explained: Conversely, call options give the holder the right to buy an asset at a specified price. They are typically bought by investors who anticipate a price increase. The Put-Call Skew: This metric compares the implied volatility of out-of-the-money put options to out-of-the-money call options. When the skew is positive and rising, it means that the demand for puts (downside protection) is significantly higher than the demand for calls (upside potential). For MicroStrategy , a 3.6% skew signals strong bearish conviction. The recent surge in put option demand for MicroStrategy suggests that a substantial number of market participants believe the stock has more room to fall, or they are actively seeking to protect their existing positions against further declines. This is a clear indicator of growing apprehension surrounding the company’s valuation and its exposure to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. The Bitcoin Connection: How MicroStrategy ‘s Holdings Influence Its Stock The fortunes of MicroStrategy are inextricably linked to Bitcoin. Under the leadership of its co-founder Michael Saylor, the company embarked on an aggressive strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, turning its corporate treasury into a massive digital asset reserve. This strategy has yielded significant returns during Bitcoin bull runs but also exposes the company to substantial risk during market downturns. Here’s how this connection plays out: Bitcoin Proxy: For many investors, buying MSTR stock is a way to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This makes MSTR highly sensitive to Bitcoin price movements. Balance Sheet Impact: Bitcoin holdings dominate MicroStrategy ‘s balance sheet. Any significant decline in Bitcoin’s value directly impacts the company’s reported assets, which can in turn affect investor confidence and stock valuation. Market Sentiment: Broader market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, directly influences how investors perceive MSTR. Negative news or a bearish trend in the crypto market can quickly translate into selling pressure for MicroStrategy stock. While MicroStrategy ’s conviction in Bitcoin remains strong, the recent stock slide and the rush for put options highlight the market’s concern over the concentrated risk. Investors are clearly weighing the potential rewards against the very real possibility of further losses should Bitcoin’s price continue its descent. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for MicroStrategy Investors The current market dynamics surrounding MicroStrategy present both challenges and opportunities. For investors, understanding these insights can help in making informed decisions: Risk Assessment: Evaluate your personal risk tolerance. MSTR is a highly volatile stock due to its Bitcoin exposure. It’s not suitable for all investors. Hedging Strategies: For existing MSTR shareholders, purchasing put options can serve as a short-term hedge against further downside. This can protect capital without requiring you to sell your shares. Diversification: Avoid over-concentration in a single stock, especially one with high volatility like MicroStrategy . Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes and sectors can mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term View: Consider your investment horizon. Long-term Bitcoin bulls might view MSTR’s dips as buying opportunities, while short-term traders might seek to profit from volatility through options. Monitor Bitcoin: Since MSTR is largely a Bitcoin proxy, closely follow Bitcoin’s price action, regulatory news, and broader crypto market trends. These will likely have a direct impact on MicroStrategy ’s stock performance. Ultimately, navigating the current landscape requires a careful balance of conviction and caution. The market is clearly signaling increased risk, and investors should adjust their strategies accordingly. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Implications for MicroStrategy and Crypto The story of MicroStrategy ’s stock slide and the corresponding put option surge extends beyond just one company; it offers insights into the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the nascent cryptocurrency market. This situation underscores several broader implications: Institutional Exposure Risks: As more traditional companies consider adding Bitcoin or other digital assets to their balance sheets, MicroStrategy serves as a cautionary tale of the volatility and market sentiment shifts they might face. Options Market Sophistication: The active options market for MSTR demonstrates the growing sophistication of investors in using derivatives to express views or manage risk in relation to crypto-linked assets. The Future of Bitcoin as a Corporate Asset: The performance of companies like MicroStrategy will continue to influence whether other corporations decide to follow suit in holding significant amounts of Bitcoin. Their success or struggles can either encourage or deter broader institutional adoption. The current bearish sentiment around MicroStrategy is a stark reminder that even with strong conviction in an underlying asset like Bitcoin, market forces and investor psychology can significantly impact stock performance. It highlights the ongoing process of price discovery and risk assessment in an increasingly interconnected financial world. The recent dramatic fall in MicroStrategy ‘s stock price, coupled with the sharp increase in put option demand, paints a clear picture of growing bearish sentiment. As the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, MSTR’s fate remains closely tied to the cryptocurrency’s performance. The soaring put-call skew indicates that investors are actively seeking downside protection, signaling concerns about the stock’s immediate future. While MicroStrategy remains a pioneering force in corporate Bitcoin adoption, its current market challenges underscore the inherent volatility and risks associated with such a concentrated digital asset strategy. For investors, understanding these dynamics and employing prudent risk management strategies will be crucial in navigating these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MicroStrategy (MSTR)? MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a business intelligence and cloud-based services company that has gained significant attention for its corporate strategy of acquiring and holding large amounts of Bitcoin. It is currently the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, making its stock often viewed as a proxy for investing in Bitcoin. Why are put options surging for MicroStrategy ? Put options for MicroStrategy are surging because its stock price has recently fallen significantly (over 14% in two weeks), indicating growing bearish sentiment among investors. Investors are buying puts to either profit from further declines or to hedge their existing positions against potential losses, signaling a strong demand for downside protection. How does Bitcoin affect MicroStrategy ‘s stock? MicroStrategy ‘s stock is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s price because the cryptocurrency constitutes a major portion of the company’s balance sheet. As Bitcoin’s value fluctuates, it directly impacts MicroStrategy ‘s perceived asset value, investor confidence, and ultimately, its stock price. A drop in Bitcoin’s price often leads to a corresponding drop in MSTR shares. What does a high put-call skew indicate for MicroStrategy ? A high put-call skew, such as the 3.6% seen for MicroStrategy , indicates that the demand and implied volatility for put options are significantly higher than for call options. This suggests that market participants are more concerned about potential downside risk and are willing to pay a premium for protection against a falling stock price, reflecting a strong bearish outlook. Is MicroStrategy a good investment right now? Whether MicroStrategy is a good investment depends on an individual’s risk tolerance and outlook on Bitcoin. Its stock is highly volatile due to its significant Bitcoin exposure. While it offers potential upside if Bitcoin rallies, it also carries substantial risk of further declines.

2025-07-31T08:30:44,"Ethereum Price Crash Or Rebound? Why $4,000 Holds The Key","Ethereum has struggled with the resistance at $4,000 over the last three years and has yet to make a definite break above this level. The constant rejection from here suggests that this is now the level to beat if the Ethereum price is to ever resume its campaign for new all-time highs from here. Given this, how the price reacts now to this level will determine whether there is a major crash coming or if bulls can continue their domination and trigger an altcoin season. $4,000 Is The Decision-Maker For Ethereum After multiple failed retests over the last year, the $4,000 has emerged as the undisputed psychological level for the Ethereum price. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader refers to this as a high-timeframe barrier due to these rejections and the major level to watch to determine the next direction for ETH. Related Reading: This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here’s What It’s Saying Now In the analysis, Alchemist explains that Ethereum has now entered a decisive stage while testing the upper boundary of a long-standing range. This long-standing range is identified as the $1,300-$4,000 range, which has held for more than a year. Following the most recent failure to break out of $4,000, Ethereum has fallen back into the range and has now entered consolidation. Below $4,000, the analyst believes that trading Ethereum is filled with both opportunity and risk. This all depends on whether the altcoin breaks out or fails next, putting investors in a precarious position of picking whether to long or short the digital asset at this level. Since previous retests of the $4,000 have led to rejections and a push back toward the mid-range or lower levels, it is possible that this time follows the established trend. However, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment in the market, and Ethereum could ride this wave into another breakout from here. What Happens In A Break Or Rejection In the event of a breakout above the $4,000, the crypto analyst does see the Ethereum price reaching new yearly highs from here. The first major resistance after $4,000 would be the $4,500 level. Next up would then be the $5,000 psychological level, which would mean brand new all-time highs for the altcoin if it were to test this resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021 On the flip side, another total rejection of $4,000 could trigger a massive crash. The last rejection from this psychological resistance back in December 2024 led to a multi-month decline that saw the price crash more than 60% before finding a bottom four months later at around $1,500. In the latter scenario, the analyst expects the Ethereum price to continue to trade inside the established $1,300-$4,000 range. As such, Alchemist advises investors that “Until a decisive move occurs, traders should remain cautious and reactive rather than overly anticipatory.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-crash-4000/,"ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS","Ethereum|crypto|crypto news|ETH|ETH news|eth price|ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare

The Central Bank of Bolivia signed memorandum with El Salvador’s Digital Assets Commission. Bolivia’s virtual asset usage surged from $46.5 million to $294 million annually. Both nations commit to sharing technical knowledge and regulatory experiences. Bolivia shows strong crypto growth The use of cryptocurrency in Bolivia rose from $46.5 million to $294 million in the span of one year. The rise took place after the implementation of R.D. No. 082/2024 regulatory framework. High adoption is recorded in the June 2024 to June 2025 period. The Central Bank of Bolivia executed an agreement with the National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador. They both wish to cooperate and share information. The agreement is regarding crypto assets and blockchain. Juan Carlos Reyes García from CNAD and Edwin Rojas Ulo from BCB signed the memorandum. The memorandum starts right away and has no expiration date. Bolivia benefits from El Salvador’s experience with regulations and use of virtual assets. The collaboration entails the exchange of technical and legal expertise between nations. Countries will exchange blockchain intelligence platforms and risk analysis methods. The system operates within the regulatory capacities and jurisdictions of each institution. This partnership is regarded by Bolivia as a significant move towards national development. The nation acquires El Salvador’s guidelines to prepare and means of implementing them. Collaboration will develop safe and controlled spaces that will draw investments. The agreement makes progress in digital assets a valid currency choice. Small businesses and households benefit most from such inclusion schemes. El Salvador’s regulatory leadership faces Bitcoin policy changes El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets became key player in global ecosystem. CNAD promotes innovation, security, and regulatory compliance across the digital asset sector. The commission regulates and supervises the industry including cryptoassets and tokens. El Salvador established itself as pioneer in virtual asset regulation regionally. The Central American nation ranks among most advanced countries promoting digital assets. However, El Salvador revoked Bitcoin’s legal tender status in January 2025. The policy change occurred through deal with International Monetary Fund. El Salvador agreed to halt new public-sector Bitcoin purchases for $1.4 billion loan. Current government Bitcoin holdings stand at approximately 6,253 BTC as of July. This number hasn’t changed since early 2025 due to IMF restrictions. Recent increases in reported reserves result from internal wallet consolidations only. The reserve figure shows existing holdings rather than fresh market purchases. El Salvador maintains Bitcoin position while complying with IMF loan conditions. The country balances crypto leadership with international financial institution requirements. Despite policy changes, El Salvador continues sharing regulatory expertise with Bolivia. The partnership allows knowledge transfer while respecting current IMF agreement terms. Both nations benefit from cooperation within existing regulatory frameworks. Central banks commit to modernizing financial systems through crypto cooperation The Central Bank of Bolivia reaffirms commitment to developing modernization policies for financial systems. The institution focuses on deepening financial inclusion through digital asset initiatives. Bolivia aims to create attractive investment environment through secure regulated ecosystems. Both central banks will exchange blockchain intelligence tools and risk analysis methods. Technical cooperation includes regulatory compliance frameworks and supervision techniques across jurisdictions. Bolivia positions itself to benefit from El Salvador’s regulatory drafting expertise significantly. The cooperation provides access to proven implementation strategies and compliance frameworks. Both nations work within their respective regulatory competencies and legal boundaries. The agreement consolidates digital assets as viable alternative to traditional currencies. Small entrepreneurs and families particularly benefit from expanded financial inclusion options. El Salvador’s pioneering status in regional crypto regulation provides valuable lessons. Bolivia gains access to tested policies and implementation strategies through partnership. The indefinite agreement duration allows long-term cooperation and knowledge sharing. Both institutions maintain flexibility to adapt cooperation as markets change. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-07-31T08:00:31,"Charles Hoskinson Backs ADA as Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer: Is Cardano Set to Outperform BTC?","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has made one of the most ambitious predictions yet for ADA, stating that the token could surge to between $80 and $800. In a recent interview with Blockworks , Hoskinson proposed that ADA could become the yield-generating layer for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem, opening new doors for utility and investor returns. Unlike Bitcoin, which is widely regarded as a store of value, Cardano offers real-world functionality. Hoskinson emphasized that ADA holders already benefit from staking rewards and ecosystem token incentives, something Bitcoin lacks in its passive holding model. “Cardano does substantially more and will end up being the yield layer of Bitcoin DeFi,” he noted, adding that ADA could grow by 100x or even 1000x in the coming years. ADA vs BTC: A Battle of Performance and Utility Historically, Cardano (ADA) has had moments of strong performance. In late 2024, it outperformed Bitcoin by 160%. But by mid-2025, the momentum shifted as ADA lagged behind. That trend began to reverse in June, when ADA gained nearly 30% more than BTC. Still, on a long-term scale since 2021, ADA remains 88% down against Bitcoin. Market dynamics show mixed sentiment. Short-term metrics like the spot taker CVD reveal increased selling pressure. However, ADA’s realized cap recently climbed from $23.4B to $23.6B, indicating renewed investor confidence despite market turbulence. Will Integration with Bitcoin’s DeFi Increase Cardano’s Market Appeal? Hoskinson’s proposal of integrating ADA into Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem could drastically reshape Cardano’s trajectory. Bitcoin currently lacks the DeFi infrastructure that platforms like Cardano or Ethereum possess. If ADA becomes the bridge between Bitcoin and decentralized finance, it could benefit from greater adoption, transaction volume, and long-term demand. However, success will depend on cross-chain infrastructure, developer support, and regulatory clarity. If executed well, this move could solidify ADA’s place as a high-yield, utility-rich asset, potentially outperforming Bitcoin in functionality and returns.
