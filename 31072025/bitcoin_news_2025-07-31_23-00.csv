2025-07-31T20:58:08,"Cryptocurrency Analysis Company Assesses the Current Status of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and SUI – What is the Current Situation?","According to the latest analysis by cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, various indicators and trends are attracting attention in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. The increased use of the word “dip” on social media suggests retail investors are looking for dip-buying opportunities. However, analyst Brian cautioned against this, noting that markets often move against the crowd's expectations. The 30-day MVRV (market value/realized value) ratio is 1.8%, while the 365-day MVRV is 22%. This suggests a risk of market overheating. Meanwhile, whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin have been observed selling approximately 16,500 Bitcoin since July 15th. While these sales were not aggressive, they do not necessarily support a price increase. On the Ethereum side, whales have been buying for the past three weeks. Whales holding more than 10,000 ETH are reported to have added approximately 0.5% of the total supply to their wallets. However, Ethereum's 30-day MVRV is hovering around 14%, while its long-term MVRV is around 36.5%. These high levels suggest the market is in the “danger zone” and may be entering a correction or cooling-off period. Santiment analysts also shared their assessments of various altcoins: XRP: It is noted that the risk has increased in XRP, which is at high levels with a 30-day MVRV of 8.7% and a 365-day MVRV of 45%. Solana: Fear is prevalent in the Solana market, with a low positive/negative comment ratio on social media. SUI: Unlike other assets, SUI's sentiment is quite high. The presence of seven positive comments for every one negative comment indicates a euphoric atmosphere in the market. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces Plans for a Strong New Push into Cryptocurrencies - Here Are the Details In the stablecoin market, Tether (USDT) whale wallets are experiencing significant activity. The percentage of the total Tether supply held in wallets worth $5 million or more has increased from below 50% to over 56.5% in the last five weeks. This could indicate that whales are preparing to inject more money into the market, according to analysts. Furthermore, the total Tether supply has increased by 6.5% in the last 10 days. *This is not investment advice.

According to the company, the Coinbase Premium Index is currently in the negative. This index measures the difference between Bitcoin's price on US-based exchanges like Coinbase and its price on other global exchanges. A negative index means Bitcoin is trading at a discount on Coinbase, meaning it's lower. This could indicate selling pressure or waning interest among US-based investors. Related News: Visa Announces It Has Added Two Altcoin Networks to Its Payment Infrastructure - One of Them Is XRP's Biggest Competitor Alphractal notes that historically, negative premiums often coincide with periods when US investors are taking profits or market interest is waning.

2025-07-31T20:53:37,"Coinbase Q2 earnings miss Wall Street estimates with disappointing numbers","Coinbase failed Wall Street’s expectations in Q2 2025, pulling in $1.5 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in net income, according to the company’s quarterly filing. The figures include a $1.5 billion unrealized gain from strategic investments and another $362 million from its crypto holdings. Even without those, Adjusted Net Income stood at $33 million, and Adjusted EBITDA reached $512 million. Transaction revenue came in at $764 million, while subscriptions and services brought in $656 million, fueled by rising USDC balances, increased staking activity, and record Prime Financing balances. By the end of June, Coinbase had $9.3 billion in U.S. dollar resources and $1.8 billion in crypto assets held for investment, thanks to consistent weekly Bitcoin purchases. They also reported the highest average custody share in their history, signaling stronger control over crypto asset safekeeping on their platform. Coinbase rolls out new derivatives, boosts app platform, and targets payments During the quarter, Coinbase pushed forward with its on-chain strategy by expanding crypto trading, financial tools, and its software infrastructure. On the trading side, it introduced the widest set of CFTC-approved perpetual futures contracts in the country, which drove record volume and open interest on its international derivatives exchange. At the same time, it kept listing new spot assets and grew its presence in global markets. Coinbase also continued expanding USDC usage by integrating it into Shopify Payments, Coinbase Business, and the Coinbase One Card. These moves brought stablecoin utility closer to daily consumer spending. The company said average USDC balances rose 13% from the last quarter, reaching $13.8 billion, helped by the reintroduction of a rewards program. As part of its lending efforts, Coinbase grew its Prime Financing operation to new highs, serving corporates, miners, hedge funds, and asset managers. According to the company, 16 of its 25 biggest institutional clients now use its financing tools. The firm also offered retail users up to $1 million in instant USDC loans, backed by BTC and settled on-chain through the Morpho protocol. Those loans now exceed $1 billion in open collateral. Meanwhile, Shopify merchants across the U.S. are now able to accept USDC, and customers who use it get 1% back in rewards, with a full rollout expected later this year. Q2 operating expenses spiked by $193 million, or 15%, mostly due to a $307 million charge linked to the data breach that was revealed in May. However, other major costs (tech, admin, and marketing) dropped 2%, totaling $977 million. Coinbase reported a full-time headcount of 4,279 employees. Although the company’s total dollar resources dropped 6% quarter-over-quarter, ending at $9.3 billion, Coinbase still has access to $12.1 billion when counting its crypto held for investment and as loan collateral. Of that, $951 million was held as collateral, and the company added $222 million in BTC during the quarter through routine weekly buys. Custody operations also scaled up. Coinbase now holds $245.7 billion in crypto under custody, the highest share of global crypto market cap it’s ever had. It also manages over 80% of all BTC and ETH ETF assets based in the U.S. New crypto laws and tokenized assets set the stage for the next phase Coinbase’s quarter closed as Washington began loosening up on crypto regulation under the Trump administration. In July, Congress passed the CLARITY Act , and President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law. The two bills give regulatory clarity for stablecoins and crypto market structure, a win for Coinbase and its long-term roadmap. At the same time, the company announced plans for an “everything exchange” that brings tokenized stocks, real-world assets, derivatives, and prediction markets on-chain. Max Branzburg, Coinbase’s VP of Product, said the rollout will start in the U.S. and expand globally once jurisdictions give the green light. “We’re building an exchange for everything,” Max said in an interview with CNBC. “Everything you want to trade, in a one-stop shop, on-chain. … We’re bringing all assets onchain—stocks, prediction markets, and more.” CEO Brian Armstrong said he wants Coinbase to be the top financial app in the world over the next decade. That includes pushing further into consumer tools, expanding tokenized products, and using new regulatory support to go global faster. As for Q3, Coinbase expects transaction revenue for July to hit $360 million. Full quarter projections show $665 to $745 million in subscription and service revenue, driven by USDC’s record market cap and higher crypto prices. Tech and admin costs are expected between $800 and $850 million, with marketing expenses ranging from $190 to $290 million, depending on performance-based campaigns and USDC user engagement.

2025-07-31T20:52:10,"Altseason 2025: Top Altcoins Surge as Bitcoin Hits $120K – 6 Must-See Charts","A fresh wave of capital is flooding into altcoins as Bitcoin trades near $120,000. According to a new CryptoQuant report, several key indicators are pointing to a possible “altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance, which measures BTC’s market share, has dropped sharply. The metric fell by over 6.3% in recent weeks and is now sitting at around 60.5%, the lowest level since March. 2025 Altseason? Altcoins are heating up after Bitcoin’s breakout to ~$120K. For example, Ethereum is up +170% from the recent lows and just ~23% from its ATH at $4,871. Here are 6 key charts showing this market shift pic.twitter.com/8fUZELmhMy — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 This decline often indicates a shift in market focus from Bitcoin to altcoins. Analysts say the pattern is playing out similar to 2021, when Ethereum and other tokens began to surge after Bitcoin led the initial rally. Ethereum Rallies 56% in a Month Amid Growing Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) has posted a 56% gain in the past month alone and is now trading around $3,854. It is only 23% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $4,871. Much of the renewed interest in ETH has been fueled by institutional demand for Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming confirmed last week it now holds 438,190 ETH, worth approximately $1.6 billion, with over 95% being staked or earning yield through liquid staking platforms. The company added over 77,000 ETH in a single week, spending $290 million at an average price of $3,756. Its ETH concentration has jumped 70% since early June. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies now leads all corporate holders with over 625,000 ETH as part of its growing $2.3 billion ETH treasury. Together, 65 institutions now hold 2.33 million ETH, worth $8.9 billion, accounting for 1.93% of Ethereum’s total supply , according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). Holdings have surged since April, with a noticeable spike in late June, reflecting growing institutional confidence in ETH as a treasury asset. This renewed interest coincides with Ethereum gaining strength against Bitcoin, as the ETH/BTC pair shows signs of upward momentum, an early signal often associated with the onset of altcoin-led rallies. Supporting this trend, CryptoQuant reports that ETH and altcoin futures volume recently reached $223.6 billion, marking the highest level in five months and reinforcing the narrative of renewed bullish interest in the broader altcoin market. Source: CryptoQuant “Altcoins are seeing heavy trading,” the firm stated. It also noted that Ethereum perpetual futures volume dominance has overtaken Bitcoin for the first time since 2022. ETH futures open interest climbed to $58 billion, with volume doubling since late June. CryptoQuant observed that altcoins and ETH now make up 83% of total futures volume, while BTC accounts for just 17%. At the same time, retail interest is picking up again. Transactions under $10,000 are up 9.7% over the past 30 days. Historically, this metric has surged ahead of major rallies in both Bitcoin and altcoins. CryptoQuant explained, “This increase aligns with psychological thresholds being crossed in BTC price, drawing in smaller investors and speculators.” The overall crypto market has added nearly $900 billion in value over the past three weeks, pushing the total market cap to $3.9 trillion. Altcoin Season Index Nearly Doubles as Market Rotation Intensifies Alongside Ethereum’s rally, other major altcoins are also on the rise. BNB is up 23% over 30 days, Solana has gained more than 21%, and XRP is up 44%. Meme coins are having their moment too, with BONK jumping 148% and FLOKI climbing 119%. Even lower-cap tokens are outperforming, with PENGU and SPX both posting gains of over 250%. Out of 424 futures trading pairs on Binance, only 23 posted losses since Bitcoin broke its all-time high, showing that over 94% of the altcoin market has reacted positively. Veteran trader Merlijn said Bitcoin dominance has entered “Phase 4″—a breakdown stage. “This is the biggest sign of an Altseason and upcoming parabolic pump,” said Ash Crypto , another analyst. A key technical indicator is also flashing. Bitcoin dominance has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and broken a three-year uptrend line. This breakdown suggests that Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market is losing strength, which historically leads to capital rotation into altcoins. The rise in ETH futures open interest to $58 billion, up from just $20 billion in April, is further proof of this momentum. In fact, this is more than what it was when ETH traded near $4,000 last December. Analysts see this as a strong sign of fresh capital entering the Ethereum market. Meanwhile, Ether’s open interest dominance has risen to 40%, a level rarely seen. Glassnode data also confirms that Ethereum futures volume has overtaken Bitcoin’s—another major first since 2022. #Ethereum open interest dominance has climbed to nearly 40%, its highest level since April 2023. Only 5% of days have seen a higher reading. This marks a clear shift in speculative focus, with capital rotating from $BTC to $ETH at the margin. pic.twitter.com/yNKLe9gJKt — glassnode (@glassnode) July 29, 2025 While a full-fledged altseason has not been confirmed, many indicators suggest the market is entering a new phase. As traders eye these structural shifts, the next few weeks could set the tone for a broad altcoin rally in the second half of 2025.

2025-07-31T20:24:22,"Coinbase Stock Tumbles 7% After Disappointing Q2 Results","Coinbase (COIN) reported worse than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, sending its shares down 7% in post-market trading. The crypto exchange posted total revenue of $1.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion in the same quarter last year but slightly lower than FactSet estimates of $1.59 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) came in at $512 million, down from $596 million a year ago. The results show Coinbase’s continued sensitivity to crypto market cycles. Even though bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied to new yearly highs during the second quarter, transaction volume fell from a quarter-to-quarter basis, Coinbase said in a press release. As a result, transaction revenue was $764 million, a 39% drop from the first quarter. Coinbase’s report follows an upbeat performance from rival Robinhood (HOOD), which reported its own quarterly results on Wednesday. HOOD, which is up 160% year-to-date, beat expectations as the company saw $28.3 billion in crypto trading volume in the second quarter. Coinbase, meanwhile, continues to lean into its dual identity as both a retail trading hub and institutional crypto infrastructure provider. The company has launched custody services for spot bitcoin ETFs, expanded its staking offerings and made further progress with its Base layer-2 network, though these businesses remain secondary to trading revenue. “In Q2, Coinbase made significant strides in bringing the financial system onchain by expanding access to trading through innovative derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally,” the company said in its earnings release.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/31/template-coinbase-earnings,"EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Markets|Coinbase|Earnings|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-31T20:24:00,"Pepe Price Prediction: Whale Selling Triggers Huge Drop – Panic Is Spreading Fast","Pepe (PEPE) has dropped 9% over the past 7 days, underperforming most other meme coins during the latest pullback — putting the current Pepe price prediction into question. Is this a sign of deeper weakness and a bearish mid-term outlook, or just a healthy correction before the next leg up? Data from CoinDesk Research shows that whales have been offloading PEPE recently, although not all of these sales appear to be voluntary, hinting at liquidations or forced exits rather than broad loss of confidence. Whale James Wynn got liquidated again. This time he was long on $PEPE . Tough to watch him lose that much. pic.twitter.com/aSNZJbpOfA — Ted (@TedPillows) July 29, 2025 A notable PEPE trader called James Wynn, who previously made a fortune by buying the meme coin once it was an unknown token for the rest of the world, was recently liquidated out of a long position. A total of $207 million worth of long positions were impacted by PEPE’s latest drop, inflicting losses of around $180,000 to Wynn in a relatively short period. This trader, known for his high-risk strategy, has seen both massive wins and painful losses. While his approach once delivered life-changing returns, the tides have turned — he was forced out of a $1 billion Bitcoin position in May, reportedly losing around $60 million. PEPE’s open interest has also taken a hit. After peaking at $1 billion on July 22, it has since plunged sharply, suggesting that many traders — possibly similar to Wynn — have been wiped out during PEPE’s 21.4% drop from $0.000014 to $0.000011. This wave of forced exits raises a critical question: Is whale capitulation an early warning sign of a deeper correction ahead? And with price action breaking key levels, does the current structure support a bearish PEPE price prediction for the mid-term? Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Drop to $0.00000850 If It Breaks Below This Key Support Pepe’s daily chart shows that the price started to retreat upon hitting the $0.00001450 mark and dropped below the 200-day exponential moving average in the past few days. Now, the 9-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have made a ‘death cross’ as they crossed below their long-term peer. This favors a bearish Pepe price prediction and could mark the beginning of a pronounced downtrend. The key support to watch at this point is the $0.00001050 area. If PEPE breaks below this level, the odds would favor a push to a much higher zone – possibly at around $0.00000850. However, since market sentiment and momentum still favor a bullish outlook, short-selling PEPE at this point would be risky as it means going against the prevailing trend. A confirmed breakout below $0.00001050 would justify taking a short position. Whether you believe that PEPE will drop to these low levels or the opposite, you can profit from your prediction through a new crypto futures trading platform called CoinFutures that lets you take directional positions on your favorite cryptocurrencies without the hassle of doing real trading. CoinFutures Supports Auto Trading Features and Offers 1000X Leverage to Boost Gains CoinFutures allows users to profit from the future price movements of top cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) without buying these cryptocurrencies directly. Meme coins like PEPE will be added to the platform shortly as well. The platform mimics the real-time volatility and price action of the crypto market through a sophisticated algorithm and integrations with top exchanges to offer transparent pricing. Users can use a price multiplier feature to take much larger positions and potentially increase their profits if the market moves in their favor. Moreover, an auto trading tool can be used to set a stop-loss and take-profit target to limit losses and cash out when the position turns a profit. To open an account, simply head to the CoinFutures website and click the “Register” button. You can deposit money via crypto transfers of USDT, USDC, ETH, and more or use a bank card.

It is using accredited investors to provide direct exposure to IP, the native cryptocurrency of Story Protocol. Grayscale has made a major push into blockchain-based intellectual property infrastructure this time around with its latest Bitcoin and Ethereum product. A New Frontier: Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property The Story Protocol integrates licensing , attribution, and royalty streams into on-chain assets. The smart contract-facilitated tools are especially relevant in an era rife with AI-generated content and mounting legal uncertainties surrounding data ownership. “Grayscale Story Trust offers investors exposure to a protocol that is developing the underlying intellectual property layer for the information and AI era,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product & Research at Grayscale. The trust will operate similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset products, holding IP as its sole asset and allowing regulated investment exposure to a market that is expected to be valued at $80 trillion worldwide. Real-World Demand and Use Cases Story Protocol is already processing over 1.7 million IP transactions a month, from music royalties to robotic surgery data sets. Its token, $IP, derives demand from creators and AI developers that need licensed, verifiable content — unlike the majority of speculative digital assets. This blockchain-first platform gives AI companies buying training data transparency, and also allows artists, researchers, and developers to embed immutable ownership and revenue structures directly into their work. Limited Access For Now The Grayscale Story Trust is currently offered to accredited investors only, which means individuals with $200,000+ annual income or institutions with $5 million+ in assets. Listing on the secondary market may be next, pending regulatory approval. This mirrors the strategy of Grayscale with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, which started out as private placements and became ETFs. Those funds had $21.2 billion and $4.25 billion in AUM as of July 30, respectively. The Bigger Picture Grayscale’s foray into the IP token economy is a sign of growing institutional confidence in the viability of blockchain use cases beyond finance. With AI advancing exponentially, clean, licensed data is becoming an essential commodity — and Story Protocol’s tokenized infrastructure may offer the rails for a decentralized, transparent, and scalable intellectual property economy.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/grayscale-launches-ip-token-trust-targeting-80-trillion-market-with-story-protocol/,"BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH","Blockchain|Sticky|Web3",cryptocompare

2025-07-31T20:00:32,"XRP Holders Connect the Dots As Speakers from BlackRock and Banks Ready for Ripple SWELL","Ripple’s flagship annual event, SWELL 2025, is already making waves in the crypto world, especially within the XRP community. Scheduled for October 22–23, 2025, in London, this year’s event promises to be one of the most significant yet. With a star-studded lineup of speakers from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, Nasdaq, and more, XRP holders are buzzing with anticipation and speculation. One name, in particular, is drawing intense attention: Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock. His scheduled appearance at SWELL has fueled growing hopes that BlackRock could be preparing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , a move that would mark a monumental step in XRP’s journey toward broader institutional adoption. Crypto influencer Crypto Eri was among the first to spotlight the significance of Stein’s presence, posting the complete speaker list and urging the XRP community to “connect the dots.” Her post quickly gained traction, with many interpreting BlackRock’s involvement as a major signal of what may come next. BlackRock Director of Digital Assets at @Ripple SWELL. Just saying. https://t.co/8TgXZ7Tbos pic.twitter.com/g246P50n92 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) July 31, 2025 BlackRock’s Presence and the XRP ETF Buzz BlackRock has already made headlines by launching Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and its increased involvement in tokenized finance has only strengthened the belief that XRP could be next in line . The company’s presence at Ripple SWELL, specifically through a digital asset executive, has stoked optimism that groundwork is being laid for a potential XRP ETF filing. The timing couldn’t be more appropriate. Ripple has been steadily positioning XRP at the heart of institutional-grade financial infrastructure. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and growing demand for compliant cross-border payment solutions, an XRP ETF would be a logical next step for institutional investors. Major Banks and Institutions Join the Conversation Beyond BlackRock, several major financial institutions will be participating in SWELL 2025, further validating Ripple’s growing influence in traditional finance. Citi’s Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets for Treasury & Trade Solutions, is scheduled to speak. Citi has previously explored blockchain-based settlement solutions, including partnerships aligned with Ripple’s technology. Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, known for her thought leadership in tokenization and digital asset strategy, is another high-profile speaker. Franklin Templeton has actively pursued blockchain innovation, often in parallel with Ripple’s institutional objectives. Carolyn Weinberg, Chief Product & Innovation Officer at BNY Mellon, represents a bank that has been a custodian leader in digital assets. Her presence signals a continued focus on integrating digital assets like XRP into secure, compliant custodial services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cynthia Lo Bessette, who heads Fidelity Digital Asset Management, brings the perspective of one of the earliest institutional backers of crypto infrastructure and ETFs. Her appearance adds further intrigue, especially given Fidelity’s exploration of tokenized assets. Ripple’s Leadership and Institutional Strategy Ripple’s executive team will be out in full force at SWELL, including Brad Garlinghouse (CEO) , Monica Long (President), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), and Jack McDonald (SVP of Stablecoins). They are expected to share critical updates on RippleNet expansion, regulatory developments, and the evolving use of XRP in liquidity solutions and global settlements. Ripple’s institutional strategy is clear: build a regulatory-compliant, scalable ecosystem where digital assets like XRP play a central role in powering the future of finance. With support from global banking leaders and top-tier asset managers, Ripple is turning that vision into reality. Connecting the Dots With speakers from BlackRock, Fidelity, Citi, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and others on the agenda, SWELL 2025 is shaping up to be a convergence point of institutional finance and blockchain innovation. The XRP community is not just paying attention; they’re reading between the lines. The presence of BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event is no coincidence. While no XRP ETF has been officially filed, the signs are hard to ignore. From increasing institutional engagement to regulatory clarity, all the right pieces seem to be falling into place. For now, XRP holders are doing exactly what Crypto Eri suggested: connecting the dots and waiting for the next big move.

2025-07-31T20:00:25,"Ondo Finance Featured In White House Report As Key Player In RWA Tokenized Finance","Ondo Finance continues to strengthen its position as a leading force in the tokenized finance space. Since launching its token in January 2024, the project has grown rapidly, carving out a prominent role in the intersection of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) integration with traditional finance (TradFi). This momentum reached a new milestone yesterday when the White House, through the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, officially recognized Ondo Finance in a new report. The report highlights tokenized securities, stablecoins, and programmable settlement as foundational to the future of the global financial system—and named Ondo among the key players leading that shift. This recognition not only legitimizes Ondo’s work but also reinforces the growing role of RWA tokenization in institutional and regulatory conversations. Their focus on equity tokenization through its custom-built Ondo Chain and its flagship tokenized US Treasury product has attracted growing interest from investors and institutions. With policy and innovation converging, the project stands out as a critical bridge between legacy markets and the decentralized future, signaling strong potential ahead for both the protocol and the broader tokenization narrative. Ondo Finance Spotlighted in White House Report In the recent report from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Ondo was featured as a core example of how tokenized systems operate—further cementing its role at the forefront of the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization movement. According to the report, industry estimates suggest that over $600 billion in RWAs could be tokenized by 2030, including money market fund shares, fixed-income instruments, private credit, and private fund shares. The report highlights that firms are approaching tokenization through two primary models: either building private, permissioned blockchains or deploying permissioned layers on top of public, permissionless networks. Ondo stands out for its hybrid approach—leveraging public infrastructure while maintaining institutional-grade compliance. A detailed chart in the report even uses Ondo to illustrate the end-to-end tokenization process. Crucially, the regulatory status of tokenized assets is determined not by the act of tokenization itself, but by the nature of the underlying asset. Since most current tokenization volume involves securities such as fixed income and private credit, these assets are generally subject to securities regulation. However, the report also notes the growing presence of tokenized commodities like gold and tokenized non-financial assets such as real estate and rare collectibles. Ondo’s inclusion in the White House report signals growing mainstream and regulatory acknowledgment of tokenized finance. With its flagship US Treasury-backed products and expansion into tokenized equities via Ondo Chain, the protocol is poised to play a major role in shaping the digital financial infrastructure of the next decade. Price Action Details: Key Level To Watch Ondo has reclaimed the $0.99 level after a volatile pullback, gaining nearly 5% on the day. The recent price bounce comes after testing the 50-day moving average (MA) at $0.86 as support, which coincides with a key psychological threshold and prior accumulation range. This area has historically triggered renewed interest from buyers, especially after sharp corrections like the one seen in mid-July. However, ONDO remains below the 200-day MA at $0.97, which now acts as immediate resistance. The token broke above this level last week after bullish momentum pushed the price past $1.20 but failed to hold the highs as sellers took profits. A sustained close above the 200-day MA could re-establish bullish control and open the path back toward the $1.20 zone. The structure still reflects a broader recovery from the multi-month downtrend that started in January 2025. If ONDO can consolidate above $0.95 and reclaim $1.05, it could mark a new higher low and signal trend continuation. On the other hand, losing the 50-day MA again would invalidate the current bounce and suggest a deeper retest toward $0.85 or even $0.78 support.

2025-07-31T20:00:17,"Bank of Russia to scrap cards issued by Visa and Mastercard","Bank of Russia is considering dates for terminating services for cards issued by the globally accepted payment networks Mastercard and Visa. The monetary authority made it clear it’s not rushing the process, as it hopes for a gradual transition to cards based on its own payment system called Mir, but also pointed out Russians can make the change as soon as they want. Days of Mastercard and Visa cards numbered in Russia The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is preparing to phase out Visa and Mastercard payment cards, replacing them with the Russian Mir cards, TASS reported, quoting the press service of the country’s main financial regulator. The authority is currently considering a deadline for Russian banks to discontinue support for cards issued by the U.S.-headquartered corporations, the official news agency detailed. The CBR is also expecting its replacement with its own Mir cards to be gradual. A spokesperson for the institution was quoted as stating: “We are currently considering the timeline, during which the servicing of cards of international payment systems should stop. It will be reasonable and sufficient for the banks to gradually replace them with Mir cards.” The Bank of Russia emphasized that international cards are still working as usual and that there is no urgent need to pull them out yet. It also noted that commercial banks will promptly inform clients about upcoming changes. Nevertheless, the regulator highlighted that Russian users can substitute them with Mir cards at any time, if they so wish. “The decision to extend the validity period for cards of international payment systems that left the Russian market was made so that people could continue to use these cards,” the CBR remarked, but then stated: “Currently, the need for the measure has lost relevance – the share of such cards in circulation is decreasing, people themselves prefer to replace them with relevant domestic ones.” Russia to scrap foreign cards 3 years after invading Ukraine Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in the Russian Federation soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Since then, their cards issued for Russian banks can be used only inside the country. After the American giants pulled out of the Russian market, local banking institutions, working with the National Payment Card System ( NSPK ), extended the validity of their cards. Earlier this month, news came out that the Central Bank of Russia intends to set a maximum validity period for all of them. The NSPK, which is wholly owned and controlled by the CBR, is Russia’s payment clearing house processing bank card transactions within its borders and the operator of the Mir card payment system. It also provides clearing for the Faster Payments System ( SBP ), which allows Russians to initiate interbank transfers using only a mobile phone number, and to make and receive payments through a QR code. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has been preparing to launch a digital version of the national fiat. The digital ruble will be introduced in stages, starting from September 2026, the monetary authority announced in June, after President Putin called for mass adoption of the sovereign digital coin. The introduction of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be accompanied by wider implementation of payments using the universal QR code already available through the SPB, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. The days of crypto payments in Russia, strongly opposed by the CBR, also seem numbered. The Russian government has been tightening the noose on transactions with Bitcoin and the like by adopting a package of laws , targeting peer-to-peer trades and curbing crypto usage in general. The only loophole for cryptocurrency payments that is likely to remain open is the one suggested by the CBR itself. That’s the “experimental legal regime” that allows Russian companies to use digital coins in foreign trade, in order to circumvent war-related sanctions that have severely limited their access to the global financial system.

Glassnode says an unnamed investor disposed of Bitcoin worth nearly $10 billion via Galaxy Digital last weekend, demonstrating Bitcoin’s “growing liquidity profile and market depth.” “This liquidity was put to the test over the weekend, as an early Bitcoin investor, via Galaxy Digital’s services, distributed 80,000 BTC (approximately $9.6 billion), likely through a mix of market sales and [over-the-counter] OTC transactions. The resulting sell-side pressure drove the price down to $115,000 before stabilizing at $119,000. This episode illustrates Bitcoin’s ability to absorb large sell-side volumes, even during typically thinner weekend trading hours, reinforcing the market’s structural robustness.” The analytics platform says that a “super-majority” of Bitcoin holders are currently sitting on significant unrealized profits, with more than 97% of the circulating supply in the black. “This underscores how the majority of investors are sitting on substantial paper gains, and sets up an environment of potential future sell-side pressure should prices continue to rise further.” Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode, profit-taking could “sharply intensify” if Bitcoin goes up by around 20% from the current level. “…Bitcoin may remain range-bound between $105,000 and $125,000 until a decisive breakout occurs. Should the market break convincingly higher, the $141,000 region is likely to present the next major zone of resistance where sell-side pressure may intensify rapidly…” Bitcoin is trading at $117,651 at time of writing.

2025-07-31T20:00:00,"Weak Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Crushed By Bear Market, Insider Warns","The latest What Bitcoin Did episode, hosted by Danny Knowles, turns squarely to the question stalking one of the market’s hottest trades: can the boom in “Bitcoin treasury” companies withstand the next prolonged drawdown? Dylan LeClair, who helps lead the Bitcoin strategy at Tokyo-listed MetaPlanet, argues the answer rests less on ideology than on balance-sheet engineering, scale, and the willingness to endure volatility without blinking. “There’s sort of a ‘gradually then suddenly’ inflection point,” he said, describing how corporate exposure to Bitcoin has migrated from gimmick to boardroom agenda. The shift, in his view, is irreversible, but survival “is a constant fight with gravity” for firms that trade at premiums to their net asset value (NAV). Why Some Bitcoin Treasury Companies Won’t Survive The Bear Market LeClair’s thesis starts with market structure. Bitcoin is homogeneous collateral, but public equities are not. Liquidity, index inclusion, and the absolute size of a balance sheet produce a “winner-take-most dynamic,” he said. Even where two issuers have the same headline premium, the gravity of size changes the calculus: “Strategy is at a measly 1.8x premium, but the premium is like $50 billion of value,” he noted, contrasting that with the far smaller absolute premia attached to emerging players. Premiums compress mechanically as companies buy more Bitcoin or as the price rises, he added, which means maintaining a rich multiple demands ever-larger inflows of capital. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Pressed on what a bear market would do to those premia, LeClair separated cycle folklore from funding reality. He does not buy the inevitability of a 70% “pack it up for three years” drawdown as a base case, arguing the market now tends to reprice and then chop for extended periods. But he is unequivocal that a risk-off phase would punish sloppy balance sheets. “There will be pressure on MNAVs… Are you levered? With what sort of debt? Do you have secured debt where your Bitcoin’s encumbered? Do you have debt due in one year?” By contrast, he pointed to perpetual preferred equity—dividends but “no debt maturity ever”—as a structure that removes the most dangerous cliff: “With the prefs it’s like, no, we’re not selling actually ever.” For MetaPlanet, he framed risk management in deliberately dull terms: “We’re focused on staying… pristine, maintaining maximal flexibility.” He cited a “BTC rating” of roughly 16.5x—“we have 16 bucks of Bitcoin for every dollar of debt”—as intentional dry powder rather than under-optimization. The stress test, to him, is behavioral as much as financial: can management “eat the 70% bear market” if it comes? He expects casualties. “It’s naive to say that every company that adopts Bitcoin will be a success… there will be failures. There will be a bankruptcy… it’s a brutal, competitive world.” Where, then, is the moat? Not merely in being public, he argued, but in graduating from equity capital to the far deeper fixed-income markets. Convertibles provided early leverage—but at a cost he described with traderly bluntness. Convertible desks “woo you,” then short aggressively to hedge, “dampening the volatility” that many treasury companies actually want in their common stock. The more durable solution, he said, is permanent capital in the form of preferred equity. Here he credits Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with reaching “escape velocity,” pioneering a layered capital stack that now includes a new variable-rate preferred dubbed “Stretch” (ticker: STRC). Stretch is engineered to keep trading near $100 by adjusting its dividend and, if necessary, issuing new shares or calling them at $101—“a pretty genius feat of financial engineering,” in LeClair’s words, because it behaves like a cash-equivalent for investors without imposing maturity cliffs on the issuer. Strategy priced STRC in late July with an initial dividend framework and then closed a multi-billion-dollar offering, with the company describing the instrument as variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to pay monthly and target trading near par. LeClair sees this as the practical realization of a long-standing ambition in crypto finance: a dollar-like instrument tied to Bitcoin collateral, without forcing asset sales in stress. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that were vulnerable to redemptions spirals, Strategy’s preferreds are senior to common equity and massively over-collateralized by transparent Bitcoin holdings, he argued. External observers have reached similar high-level descriptions: Strategy’s own materials emphasize STRC’s variable dividend on a stated $100 amount, while coverage in financial media notes the offering’s explicit aim to hew to par and its place alongside earlier preferreds (Stride, Strike, Strife) in a capital stack backed by tens of billions in unencumbered Bitcoin. All of this feeds the consolidation logic LeClair expects in a downturn. Preferreds, he said, are both offensive and defensive. Offensively, they add dry powder to buy more BTC or even buy back common if MNAV compresses, reversing flow against short sellers “playing this spread game.” Defensively, they function as an “MNAV defense mechanism,” easing reliance on converts and the gamma-trading that “neuters volatility” in the common. If markets turn, he anticipates classic Wall Street behavior: opportunists will “clear off some debt, buy the Bitcoin at a discount.” MetaPlanet, he added, is not seeking to be a roll-up; the focus is “laser” on BTC itself. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution Could Anyone Catch Strategy? LeClair is diplomatic on peers bringing large private Bitcoin pools public, calling it “overwhelmingly positive” for the asset. But his competitive assessment is stark: “I think Saylor’s reached escape velocity… a 600,000 Bitcoin lead is pretty insurmountable.” To contextualize that claim with public data, Strategy now reports roughly 629,000 BTC, giving it a commanding lead over other corporate holders. He adds that only a mega-cap with a decisive pivot—“if Mark Zuckerberg took the orange pill tomorrow”—could realistically challenge, which he deems unlikely given competing priorities like AI. LeClair is no maximalist about smooth sailing. Premiums will ebb. Funding windows will open and slam shut. Some firms, he warned, are “cosplaying as Bitcoiners” and may abandon discipline at the first whiff of pain. He was also frank about the sector’s self-selection bias: during the good times, new “treasury companies” appear by the week; the real filter arrives when prices fall and maturities near. “The times are good now… there will be a cycle. That’s what will separate the men from the boys,” he said. Survival, in his telling, comes down to a few non-negotiables: unencumbered collateral, long-dated or perpetual liabilities, and management that will not sell into downdrafts. Yet his broader message is that the game board has changed. Corporate adoption remains “early innings,” he said, because “the rest of the world actually simply doesn’t care” yet. The depth of the credit markets—and the emergence of Bitcoin-backed instruments palatable to those markets—may be what finally does the persuading. “If Bitcoin is going to eat the world… it has to get to all these different pools of capital.” Treasury companies that make that leap, he believes, can not only endure a bear market—they can use it to widen the gap. At press time, BTC traded at $118,100.
