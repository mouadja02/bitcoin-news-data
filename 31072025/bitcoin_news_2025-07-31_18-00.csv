""A First!""","As the Bitcoin and altcoin treasury strategy continues to expand around the world, news also came from the United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, the company announced that it has established a $150 million crypto treasury consisting of 514 Bitcoin (BTC) and 630,000 Solana (SOL), the first reserve in Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi-based Bitcoin mining company Phoenix Group has launched a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve, becoming the first public company to establish a digital asset treasury on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX). The company described this move as a reflection of its confidence in the long-term value of the blockchain networks that support these assets. Munaf Ali, co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group, emphasized that holding digital assets like Bitcoin and Solana is not only about market visibility but also about adapting to the evolving financial landscape. ‚ÄúPhoenix has always been much more than a mining company. We are a faith-driven digital infrastructure group. ‚ÄúHolding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn't just about visibility. It's about compliance.

El Salvador and Bolivia will share technical and legal expertise on crypto-related issues. The agreement between Bolivia and El Salvador will enhance the former‚Äôs national development. Bolivia and El Salvador have signed a deal to collaborate on expanding cryptocurrency adoption between themselves. In a strategic move, the Bolivian Central Bank (BCB) and El Salvador‚Äôs National Digital Assets Commission (CNAD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to formalize the partnership between the two Latin American nations. Crypto adoption grew in Bolivia last year This partnership comes as Bolivia has experienced a massive surge in cryptocurrency adoption.

2025-07-31T15:20:30,"Bolivia and El Salvador sign crypto agreement to develop digital finance framework","Bolivia has inked a historic bilateral agreement with El Salvador to promote cryptocurrency adoption , taking a significant step toward modernising the banking system. The agreement, which is intended to boost Bolivia‚Äôs struggling economy and promote financial inclusion, follows in the footsteps of El Salvador, the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. The deal marks a strategic shift for Bolivia, which is in the midst of an economic crisis and running at historically low international reserves. Through digital assets, the country is seeking alternatives to traditional monetary systems to help stabilise its economy and increase access to financial resources. A new phase of bilateral cooperation The agreement was signed by the interim president of the Central Bank of Bolivia, Edwin Rojas Ulo, and the head of El Salvador‚Äôs National Commission of Digital Assets, Juan Carlos Reyes Garc√≠a. The statement establishes a framework for technological and political collaboration centred on bitcoin use and the creation of safe digital infrastructures. The two countries intend to cooperate to pursue measures targeted at increasing cryptocurrency use while ensuring the essential safeguards are in place. The agreement also specifies procedures for sharing institutional knowledge and developing public policies to bridge the gap between existing banking institutions and emerging digital finance alternatives. Rising crypto activity in Bolivia The partnership comes in the wake of Bolivia‚Äôs 2024 decision to begin phasing out its long-standing ban on cryptocurrencies‚Äîa move that has led to a surge in digital asset transactions. In the first half of 2025 alone, Bolivia recorded $294 million in cryptocurrency activity, reflecting growing public interest and broader adoption of digital assets. As Bolivia navigates this transition, it is looking to El Salvador‚Äîa global benchmark for crypto adoption‚Äîfor guidance. The collaboration aims to support Bolivia in developing a framework to integrate cryptocurrencies into everyday economic activity through knowledge sharing and coordination between policymakers. Addressing dollar shortages and financial gaps Bolivia‚Äôs decision is motivated not only by innovation but also by the need to address serious budgetary realities. A continuous lack of US dollars and increasing pressure on import financing have led the country to consider other solutions. Cryptocurrencies may provide a lifeline for small enterprises and households with restricted access to banking services and foreign currency. By reducing its reliance on established banking channels, the country aims to open up new economic opportunities. The agreement envisions digital assets serving as both a practical tool and a policy instrument to increase economic participation. A regional trend toward digital finance The Bolivia‚ÄìEl Salvador agreement is a manifestation of the regional movement towards digital finance as a tool to counter systemic economic difficulties. Such partnerships could become more prevalent as additional nations across Latin America weigh the role of digital currencies in their development strategies. While the road to mass adoption is far from certain and fraught with regulatory and technical challenges, it nevertheless puts Bolivia among a growing list of nations interested in using relatively new technologies and ideas to modernise their respective economies.

2025-07-31T15:11:24,"Japan overhauls crypto oversight as market grows to $2.66 trillion","Japan is making a decisive regulatory shift to better align with the global rise in cryptocurrency markets, moving oversight of digital assets from the Payment Services Act to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The change, spearheaded by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), reflects the country‚Äôs evolving approach to treating crypto as an investment product rather than a mere payment instrument. It comes as Japan‚Äôs crypto trading volumes are projected to double from $66.6 billion in 2022 to $133 billion, even as domestic influence lags behind global trends in decentralised finance and tokenised asset markets. FSA convenes working group to shape legislative changes On 31 July, the FSA held the first meeting of its Crypto Assets Working Group , launching a structured review to reclassify digital tokens. The group, made up of academics, industry leaders, and tax experts, discussed enhancing legal protections for investors and tailoring oversight to reflect the rapid shift in market behaviour and digital asset usage. The group acknowledged that the global crypto market had ballooned from $872 billion to $2.66 trillion, highlighting the urgency for more robust investor safeguards and scalable legal systems. Japan, meanwhile, holds 12.1 million crypto accounts valued at $33 billion, indicating substantial domestic engagement despite concerns over international competitiveness and innovation gaps. New classification to separate fundraising tokens from established assets Under the proposed reforms, Japan aims to create a two-tier system for crypto asset regulation. Fundraising tokens, such as those issued through ICOs or token sales, would face strict disclosure requirements from issuers. In contrast, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin would remain under exchange-regulated regimes designed to maintain stability, transparency, and risk monitoring. Yuichiro Matsui from the University of Tokyo emphasised the need for modernised frameworks, while Georgetown University‚Äôs Shinichiro Matsuo stressed that any future regulation must address security, adaptability, and cross-border cooperation in the evolving Web3 economy. The FSA also intends to address transparency and fraud prevention, with future plans potentially including laws against insider trading within the crypto sector. Draft proposals are expected before the end of 2025, with legislative changes likely by early 2026 to enforce regulatory clarity. Crypto tax policy under scrutiny as fraud risks persist Taxation was another key focus of the meeting. Yuichi Murakami, a tax expert, warned against treating crypto wallets as separate entities for taxation. Responding to industry demands for Web3-friendly tax rules, Murakami pointed out that current systems lack the tools to handle fragmented wallet data, and that separate taxation could open the door to fraud, misreporting, and tax evasion. Murakami shared his concerns on X, formerly Twitter, stating that any effort to create wallet-specific tax breaks must be preceded by clear standards and investor protections.

2025-07-31T15:06:00,"Ethereum Hits $10B Reserve as XRP ETF Nears, SEC Eyes Crypto Leadership Shift","Ethereum marked its 10th anniversary with a major milestone, corporate treasuries now hold over 2.73 million ETH valued above $10 billion, accounting for 2.26% of its circulating supply. Companies like SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion Technologies now lead as the largest holders, even surpassing the Ethereum Foundation. This growth comes amid mounting institutional interest, with Ethereum ETFs attracting over $65 million in daily inflows and $21.5 billion in assets under management. The in-kind creation/redemption model approved by the SEC has added further appeal, offering tax efficiency for large investors. XRP and Solana ETFs Could Arrive by October The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has introduced a Generic Listing Standards framework allowing a dozen digital assets to qualify for ETF approval if they‚Äôve traded futures contracts on designated exchanges for six months. This includes Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Solana‚Äôs ETF approval could come as early as October 10, while XRP‚Äôs is expected shortly after. According to market analysts, approval odds for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs exceed 95%. The SEC has also approved mixed Bitcoin-Ethereum ETPs, expanded options contract limits, and introduced tax-friendly redemption methods. These changes slash bureaucracy by eliminating the traditional 19b-4 rule change process, streamlining ETF listings to a 75-day review. SEC Delegates Power to CFTC, Aims to Lead Global Crypto Adoption The SEC has effectively outsourced ETF approval authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by basing eligibility solely on futures trading history. SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized that the Commission will now ‚Äúlead the cryptocurrency revolution,‚Äù pushing for future-proof regulation while protecting investors. Despite criticism of Coinbase Derivatives‚Äô monopoly in qualifying futures markets, the SEC‚Äôs decision marks a regulatory shift, potentially positioning the U.S. as a global center in crypto innovation. With 72 crypto ETF applications pending, the coming months could usher in one of the most bullish eras for institutional crypto adoption in U.S. history.

2025-07-31T15:05:30,"Top Altcoins Recover after Fed Warnings, Showing Market Stability","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell chose to keep interest rates steady, but his remarks on escalating inflation risks from tariffs unsettled crypto markets. Traders on leverage platforms experienced a surge in liquidations as sentiment shifted to risk-averse. $200M in Leveraged Liquidations In less than 60 minutes, over $200M in leveraged crypto positions were forcibly unwound. Bitcoin dropped below $116K, with Ethereum falling about 3%, before both partially recovered. Bitcoin quickly recovered ‚Äì it is currently back above $118K, though it still logged a daily loss of about 0.8%. Ethereum stabilized around $3,750, finishing down approximately 0.6%. Currently, Bitcoin has returned to its starting point, up 0.7%, while Ethereum is up 2%. Powell‚Äôs ‚Äòwait-and-see‚Äô approach : The Fed‚Äôs next meeting isn‚Äôt until September, giving the board of governors two months to analyze and interpret economic data. Powell appears eager to do this. Early odds for a Fed rate cut are at 39%, according to CME Fedwatch . Overall market strength : Minus a rate hike‚Äîvirtually impossible‚Äîthe worst-case scenario was simply the continuation of the current situation. That situation looks pretty good‚ÄîBitcoin trading is below but within range of its recent all-time high, the total crypto market cap is rising to nearly $4 trillion, and major tokens like $ETH are surging. Altcoins Bore Brunt of Fed-Prompted Dip Altcoins experienced larger swings: $SOL, $AVAX, and $HYPE each declined by 4‚Äì5% before bouncing back; meme tokens $BONK and $PENGU dropped around 10%, then later recovered. In contrast, Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced strong earnings after hours ‚Äì stocks rising 10% and 6% respectively ‚Äì bringing a stabilising tone. Matt Mena, from 21Shares, argues that the Fed‚Äôs reaction may lag. With consumer spending weakening, unemployment rising, and real yields still restrictive, continued rate tightness could risk a deeper slowdown. At the same time, if the Fed raises rates in September, there‚Äôs still time for a response. And on the Bitcoin front, Matt predicts that ‚Äì rate cut or not ‚Äì Bitcoin could soon enter another price discovery phase and move back past $120K. Analysts believe Bitcoin could rally toward $150K if the Fed pivots by year-end. That assumes inflation continues cooling and macroeconomic pressure accelerates policymaker shifts. And it would certainly set up the best altcoins for a renewed surge.

In today‚Äôs Crypto for Advisors newsletter, Alec Beckman from Psalion writes about Ether‚Äôs growing role as a treasury reserve asset and highlights growing trends. Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers questions about Ether as an investment in Ask an Expert. Thank you to our sponsor of this week's newsletter, Grayscale. For financial advisors: register for the upcoming Minneapolis event on September 18th. - Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ethereum: The Rising Treasury Asset Reshaping Corporate Finance Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is rapidly being adopted by public companies as a strategic treasury asset, an evolution that is helping to reshape corporate finance and shift ETH‚Äôs market dynamics. Bitcoin has long dominated the digital treasury conversation . Its capped supply and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Ether is catching up, thanks to its yield potential, economics, real-world utility, and maturing institutional infrastructure. Why Ethereum Appeals to Treasuries Ethereum‚Äôs 2022 transition to proof-of-stake enabled holders to earn annual staking yields between 2% and 4%, creating a passive income layer that Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt offer. The asset has also been deflationary at times, with more ETH burned than issued, supporting a store-of-value thesis. At the same time, Ethereum powers an ecosystem of decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. For corporations, it can function not only as a reserve asset but also as capital for deploying services and infrastructure. The ETH Treasury Wave Several public companies are now building treasury strategies around ETH, following early movers like MicroStrategy in Bitcoin: Bit Digital holds over 120,300 ETH and stakes its entire allocation. CEO Sam Tabar calls it a ‚Äúflywheel model,‚Äù where staking yield funds operations. They plan to add more to the tune of > $1b. BTCS recently increased its holdings to over 70,000 ETH and was among the first public firms to stake ETH as a treasury strategy. Bitmine Immersion is aiming to acquire 5% of total ETH supply . Backed by significant funding and led by Tom Lee, it now holds over 625,000 ETH. Sharplink Gaming holds more than $1.67 billion in ETH, adding nearly 80,000 coins in a single week and pursuing staking as a core strategy. Joe Lubin is a board member and running their ETH acquisition strategy. Gamesquare has allocated an initial $30 million in ETH with approval to scale to $250 million . It also plans to integrate DeFi and NFT-based yield as differentiators. GameSquare sees the Ethereum Network as Manhattan, with a Financial District (DeFi), an art district (NFTs), and more. Investing in it today is critical for future value and use. The Ether Machine , a SPAC-backed vehicle spun out from Publicly Traded Dynamix, is targeting $1.5 billion in ETH as it prepares to go public. The companies listed above all plan to add significantly more. Other companies have just announced their holdings such as ETHzilla . These companies aren‚Äôt just buying‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre signaling long-term conviction and, in many cases, building products and revenue streams directly on Ethereum. One example is GameSquare, whose strategy closely aligns with their audience in the gaming, media, and entertainment industries and sees the connection with on-chain products built on Ethereum. It is important to them to foster financial alignment with their audience. BTCS is implementing a similar strategy to align with its audience, as block building and staking create a vertical stack on the Ethereum Network, resulting in efficiencies in transactions and staking. The Demand‚ÄìSupply Imbalance ETH‚Äôs price has climbed steadily in recent months, and public company purchases are one of the primary catalysts for this increase. In a recent 30-day span, over 32 times more ETH was purchased than issued . That includes buying from treasury allocators, staking vehicles, and newly approved ETFs. A continuation of this trend will create a supply shock. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners often must sell their bitcoin to cover operational costs, Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake reduces sell-side pressure and aligns holders with securing the network. Conclusion Ethereum is no longer just a platform for developers; it‚Äôs now a financial asset that public companies are adopting at scale. With built-in yield, deflationary dynamics, and rising institutional demand, ETH is emerging as a cornerstone of corporate treasury strategy. As more firms move from ‚Äúinterested‚Äù to ‚Äúallocated,‚Äù this new wave of ETH buyers may help define the next phase of the crypto cycle. Special thank you to Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit-Digital, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare and Rhydon Lee, managing partner of Goff Capital (affiliated with GameSquare) on sharing their insights with me on ETH Treasury Companies, differentiation, and the Ethereum network in general. - Alec Beckman, vice president of growth, Psalion Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q: Why is ETH being discussed as a strategic reserve asset? A: Ethereum has quietly become financial infrastructure, not just a speculative asset. Unlike bitcoin (which is mostly a ‚Äústore of value‚Äù ), ETH powers a real economy that ties to smart contracts, tokenized assets, stablecoin transactions, and decentralized financial services. As more economic activity settles on Ethereum, ETH is being considered a reserve asset by institutions, fintech firms, DAOs, and even sovereign actors. The reason is that ETH is the fuel that makes the system work. It's similar to holding oil in an energy economy or treasuries in a dollar system. Q: Should corporate treasuries treat ETH like a cash equivalent, long-duration tech-oriented equity, or a form of intangible infrastructure? A: In practice, I see this as a new sleeve in the portfolio that I‚Äôd call a ‚Äúdigital infrastructure reserve."" It carries tech beta and regulatory risk, but also offers operational utility (smart-contract escrow, settlement, tokenization rails). That‚Äôs neither cash nor equity. Q: How do you translate ‚ÄúETH as a strategic reserve‚Äù into practical implications? A: For institutions and treasuries: ETH serves as the cash and collateral for running on-chain businesses. It generates yield (staking) like T-bills. It‚Äôs held on balance sheets, declared in treasury policies, and audited. For individuals & families: ETH is treated as a long-term strategic asset. Allocated thoughtfully (at least 1 ‚Äî 5%) and separated from short-term needs. Used to earn staking income, hedge against fiat devaluation, and gain exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs growing role in finance and tokenized infrastructure. Q: What would prove that ETH deserves to be treated like a serious reserve asset over the next 10 years? A: If more of the world‚Äôs financial activity like tokenized real estate, stablecoins, and large international payments are settling directly on Ethereum, it shows growing trust in the network. As Ethereum becomes core infrastructure for global value transfer, ETH moves from speculation to a legitimate strategic reserve. Strategicethreserve.xyz is a great source for gauging progression. Beyond that, it's helpful to watch the innovation and creativity of names like Robinhood and The Ether Machine, to name a few. - Eric Tomaszewski, financial advisor, Verde Capital Management Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading The White House released its first Digital Asset Policy Repor t on Wednesday, July 30th.

2025-07-31T14:51:27,"Crypto adoption surges among CFOs at billion-dollar firms, Deloitte survey shows","Cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe financial asset‚Äîit is now a strategic consideration for the world‚Äôs largest corporations. According to Deloitte‚Äôs Q2 2025 CFO Signals survey , 99% of chief financial officers at companies generating over $1 billion in annual revenue expect crypto to become part of their long-term business operations. This signals a shift in how top finance executives view digital assets, moving beyond speculation into areas like treasury management, payments, and supply chain efficiency. Conducted among 200 CFOs, the survey reveals a layered picture of rising interest tempered by structural and regulatory hurdles. Still, the integration of digital assets is no longer just a theoretical discussion‚Äîit is actively reshaping corporate finance strategies. One in four large-cap CFOs expect crypto investments by 2027 Among companies with revenue exceeding $10 billion, 24% of CFOs expect their finance departments to directly invest in non-stable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether within the next two years. Across all firms surveyed, the number sits at 15%. These expectations reflect growing confidence in the asset class despite persistent market volatility. Stablecoins are also gaining ground. While 15% of CFOs at billion-dollar firms overall said they expect to accept stablecoins for payments within 24 months, the figure jumps to 24% among the largest corporations. These companies cite customer privacy (45%) and payment speed and cost-effectiveness (39%) as key motivators for adopting stablecoins in payment systems. Price volatility and policy uncertainty still top concerns Despite this institutional momentum, risk remains a primary deterrent. Price volatility was cited as the top concern by 43% of respondents, particularly in relation to non-stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC at $118,641) and Ether (ETH at $3,812). Accounting complexity was flagged by 42% of CFOs as a challenge, especially under current US GAAP standards that don‚Äôt treat crypto assets as cash equivalents. Meanwhile, regulatory uncertainty‚Äîparticularly in the United States‚Äîwas a sticking point for 40% of finance heads. Ongoing shifts in US crypto policy continue to delay more aggressive adoption, even as other regions introduce clearer frameworks. Use cases go beyond finance, into supply chains and operations While treasury exposure and payments dominate near-term adoption plans, long-term visions are broader. More than half the CFOs surveyed see crypto and blockchain technology playing a role in areas such as supply chain management and asset tracking. Blockchain‚Äôs transparent, immutable ledger is seen as a valuable tool for payment verification and operational audits. In addition, crypto is becoming a regular boardroom topic. Thirty-seven percent of CFOs have discussed digital assets with their boards, 41% with chief investment officers, and 34% with banks or lenders. Only 2% reported no crypto-related conversations at all, indicating a widespread recognition of its potential business impact. Institutional exposure widens to Solana and XRP A separate March 2025 survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon echoed these trends. Among institutional investors polled, 83% said they plan to increase their crypto exposure this year. While Bitcoin and Ether continue to dominate allocations, other assets such as Solana (SOL at $177.90) and XRP (XRP at $3.11) have emerged as popular secondary bets. Notably, a majority of institutional respondents said they plan to allocate at least 5% of their portfolios to digital assets in 2025. This underlines a broader diversification strategy that is now filtering down to the operational level, particularly in high-revenue companies.
