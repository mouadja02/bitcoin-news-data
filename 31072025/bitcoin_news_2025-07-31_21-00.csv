2025-07-31T18:55:11,"Unveiling the Significant Bitcoin Transfer: 3,650 BTC Moves from Kraken","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Significant Bitcoin Transfer: 3,650 BTC Moves from Kraken In the ever-pulsating world of cryptocurrency, moments of significant activity often capture the market’s collective gaze. One such event recently sent ripples through the digital asset community: a colossal Bitcoin transfer . Imagine hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency, moving from a well-known exchange to an undisclosed destination. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a headline-grabbing event that prompts questions, speculation, and deep dives into the mechanics of the crypto ecosystem. For anyone invested in or simply curious about Bitcoin, understanding such movements is paramount. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Transfer ? The crypto monitoring service Whale Alert recently flagged a massive transaction that immediately drew attention. A staggering 3,650 BTC, equivalent to approximately $430 million at the time of the transfer, moved from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. This isn’t the first time such a large sum has shifted, but each instance reignites discussions about market dynamics, security, and the enigmatic figures behind these monumental movements. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported event: Asset Transferred: 3,650 BTC (Bitcoin) Origin: Kraken Exchange Destination: An ‘unknown’ wallet address Approximate Value: $430,000,000 USD Reported By: Whale Alert While the amount is undeniably large, it’s crucial to understand that a transfer from an exchange like Kraken doesn’t necessarily imply the exchange itself is the sender. More often than not, it signifies a large client withdrawal or an internal movement by the exchange for operational purposes, such as consolidating funds or moving assets into cold storage for enhanced security. Why Do These Massive Bitcoin Transfers Captivate the Market? Large Bitcoin transfers , especially those involving ‘unknown’ wallets, are closely watched for several reasons. They are often perceived as indicators of potential market shifts, institutional interest, or even significant strategic moves by major players. These movements can trigger a range of reactions, from cautious optimism to widespread speculation. The fascination stems from their potential impact on: Market Volatility: A large influx or outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges can signal impending buy or sell pressure, potentially leading to price fluctuations. Investor Sentiment: Such transfers can influence the overall mood of the market. If perceived as a move towards selling, it might induce fear; if seen as accumulation, it could foster bullish sentiment. Institutional Activity: Often, large transfers are linked to institutional investors, hedge funds, or high-net-worth individuals making significant strategic decisions. Liquidity: Movements of this scale can affect the liquidity available on exchanges, impacting trading conditions. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the often-unpredictable crypto landscape. While not every large transfer leads to immediate market upheaval, they are certainly data points worth considering for any serious crypto participant. Who Are These Elusive Crypto Whales? The term ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity that holds a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price. These are the giants of the crypto world, whose movements are meticulously tracked by analysts and automated services like Whale Alert. Crypto whales come in various forms: Early Adopters: Individuals who invested heavily in Bitcoin during its nascent stages and now hold vast fortunes. Institutions: Investment firms, hedge funds, and corporations that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets or manage large crypto portfolios for clients. Exchanges: Centralized exchanges like Kraken hold significant amounts of user funds, and their internal movements for operational purposes can appear as ‘whale’ transactions. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: These are private trading desks that facilitate large transactions between buyers and sellers, often bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. The anonymity inherent in blockchain technology means that while we can see the transactions, identifying the exact identity behind an ‘unknown wallet’ often remains a mystery. This veil of anonymity is a core feature of blockchain, offering privacy but also fueling speculation about the motives behind large transfers. How Do Such Transfers Impact Your Portfolio? For the average investor, a massive Bitcoin transfer can evoke a mix of curiosity and concern. While it’s easy to jump to conclusions, it’s vital to maintain a balanced perspective and avoid panic-driven decisions. Here’s how such transfers might indirectly affect your portfolio and what to consider: Potential Impact Explanation Investor Takeaway Market Speculation News of large transfers often leads to speculation about future price movements (up or down). Don’t react impulsively; verify information and consider multiple perspectives. Price Volatility If the whale intends to sell, it could increase supply and potentially depress prices. If accumulating, it could signal bullish sentiment. Be prepared for short-term price swings; focus on long-term strategy. Security Concerns While this transfer from Kraken is likely legitimate, large movements can sometimes be associated with hacks (though rare from reputable exchanges). Ensure your own assets are secured in reputable wallets and exchanges. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is complex, and no single transaction dictates its entire trajectory. Diversification and a long-term investment horizon often prove to be more robust strategies than reacting to every large whale movement. Is Blockchain Anonymity a Blessing or a Curse? The ‘unknown wallet’ aspect of this Bitcoin transfer highlights a fundamental characteristic of blockchain: pseudonymity. While transactions are publicly recorded on the immutable ledger, the identities behind the wallet addresses remain anonymous unless voluntarily disclosed or linked through off-chain activities. This dual nature presents both advantages and challenges: Blessing (Privacy): It offers a degree of financial privacy that traditional banking systems often lack, empowering individuals with control over their financial data. Curse (Speculation & Illicit Activity): The anonymity can lead to heightened speculation about the motives behind large transfers and can, unfortunately, be exploited for illicit activities, although sophisticated blockchain analytics are increasingly capable of tracing such funds. Reputable exchanges like Kraken adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, meaning that while the destination wallet might be ‘unknown’ to the public, Kraken would have information about the client initiating the withdrawal. This regulatory layer adds a crucial element of trustworthiness to the ecosystem, especially for regulated entities. What Should You Do When a Whale Moves? When news of a significant Bitcoin transfer breaks, it’s natural to feel a surge of curiosity, perhaps even anxiety. However, reacting impulsively can be detrimental to your investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and analytics platforms, but critically assess the information. Not every large transfer signifies a market crash or boom. Understand Context: Consider the broader market conditions. Is Bitcoin in a bull run, bear market, or consolidation phase? Large transfers can have different implications depending on the context. Reinforce Your Security: Use such news as a reminder to review your own crypto security practices. Are your assets stored securely? Are you using strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication? Stick to Your Strategy: Unless your fundamental investment thesis has changed, avoid making rash decisions based on single events. A well-defined investment strategy helps weather market fluctuations. Conduct Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on headlines. Dive deeper into the data, explore the wallet addresses (if you have the technical know-how), and understand the potential scenarios. Remember, the crypto market thrives on information, but it’s the informed interpretation of that information that truly empowers investors. Looking Ahead: The Future of Large-Scale Bitcoin Movements As the cryptocurrency market matures, large-scale Bitcoin transfers are likely to become more common, reflecting growing institutional adoption and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. We may see more transparency in some areas, driven by regulatory pressures, while the core pseudonymity of blockchain will likely remain. The evolution of blockchain analytics tools will also play a significant role, making it easier to track and potentially identify the entities behind ‘unknown’ wallets, albeit without compromising the fundamental privacy principles of decentralized networks. These tools help distinguish between legitimate operational transfers and potentially suspicious activities, further enhancing the security and integrity of the crypto ecosystem. The recent 3,650 BTC transfer from Kraken to an unknown wallet serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such massive movements can spark immediate speculation, they are often part of the normal, albeit large-scale, operations within the digital asset space. Whether signaling a strategic move by a whale, an institutional accumulation, or simply an internal exchange consolidation, these transfers underscore the importance of staying informed, exercising caution, and maintaining a long-term perspective. The world of Bitcoin is always moving, and understanding these significant transfers is key to navigating its fascinating currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through significant buy or sell orders. Why are large Bitcoin transfers significant? Large Bitcoin transfers are significant because they can signal potential market shifts, institutional interest, or major strategic moves by large investors. They can impact market sentiment, liquidity, and even short-term price volatility. Was Kraken involved in sending the 3,650 BTC? While the transfer originated from Kraken, it typically means a large client withdrawal or an internal operational transfer by the exchange (e.g., moving funds to cold storage), rather than Kraken itself selling or moving funds for speculative purposes. Exchanges facilitate user transactions. How can I track large crypto movements? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news outlets also report on these movements, often providing analysis and context. Should I be concerned about this specific Bitcoin transfer? While it’s important to stay informed, there’s generally no need for immediate concern or panic. Large transfers are common in the crypto world. It’s crucial to understand the context, avoid impulsive decisions, and focus on your long-term investment strategy rather than reacting to every whale movement.

2025-07-31T18:48:08,"Binance’s Spot Trading Volume Rises Rapidly Again: According to Analysts, This Signals Something","Joao Wedson, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal, highlighted a striking development in the Bitcoin spot market. According to Wedson, Binance has been moving back towards market leadership in terms of spot trading volume in recent weeks. According to Alphactal data, Binance's share, which accounted for approximately 40% of the Bitcoin spot market volume in April 2025, has now approached 45%. This suggests that Binance is on track to surpass the combined volume of all other exchanges. Wedson reminds us that this kind of volume concentration has been observed in previous cycles: “Historically, when Binance has achieved leadership in spot volume, significant increases in Bitcoin prices have followed. This typically signals the entry of institutional investors seeking more efficient trading with increased liquidity, deeper order books, and lower slippage rates.” Related News: BREAKING: Unexpected Move from SEC - They Announced an Initiative Called “Project Crypto” Wedson also noted a significant shift in the Spot Volume Delta data between Binance and other exchanges. After months of negative net flows, Binance has begun to experience positive inflows again. Percentage distribution charts show Binance reaching its highest dominance in spot volume since the end of 2023. However, Wedson cautions that despite this rise, total spot volume is still below the peaks of late 2024 and early 2025. “This resurgence of Binance could lead to a re-centralization of liquidity and more efficient price discovery. Historically, such consolidations often precede phases of market expansion,” Wedson said, adding that there is still significant growth potential for institutional and individual investors. *This is not investment advice.

In a statement, the firm says it sold notes worth $950 million in principal amount, generating net proceeds of approximately $940.5 million. The 0% notes were sold to institutional buyers in a private offering and will be due in 2032. Mara says it used $18.3 million of the proceeds to repurchase approximately $19.4 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1% convertible senior notes due 2026. It also allocated about $36.9 million to cover the cost of capped call transactions with the initial purchasers of the notes and other financial institutions. Mara says it will use some of the newly raised capital to purchase more Bitcoin as the Florida-based company builds a strategic crypto reserve to strengthen its financial position. “MARA expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds to acquire additional Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of existing assets, and repayment of additional debt and other outstanding obligations.” According to the Bitcoin holdings tracker BitcoinTreasuries.net, Mara is currently the second-leading public Bitcoin treasury company with 50,000 BTC worth $5.92 billion. American software company Strategy is still the biggest with 628,791 BTC worth $74.45 billion.

Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run. Realized profits spiked to $6–8B in late July, on par with March and Dec 2024 peaks. It was new whales who led the selling above $120K. pic.twitter.com/Q4FQkLXcin — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 While each wave has marked a cooling-off period for prices, the pattern also suggests the potential for another upward breakout once the market consolidates and recalibrates. On-chain data, investor behavior, and exchange flows all point to a classic “profit, pause, push” sequence now underway. ETF Launches, Trump Rally, Whale Exit: The Three Waves The first profit-taking wave hit in March 2024, triggered by the approval of U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The hype around this milestone drove prices toward $70,000, prompting early holders to lock in gains. A second wave followed from December 2024 to February 2025, as Bitcoin rallied beyond $100,000 after Donald Trump’s re-election victory, again triggering widespread selling. The third and most recent wave arrived in late July 2025, when Bitcoin surged past $120,000. This wave was punctuated by the sale of 80,000 BTC by an OG whale on July 25—a clear indicator of profit realization at the top. In each case, the market experienced temporary cooling, with consolidation phases lasting between two and four months before resuming the broader uptrend, reports CryptoQuant. On-Chain Metrics Confirm Another Peak CryptoQuant data shows that realized profits among Bitcoin holders spiked to $6–8 billion in late July, levels comparable to the previous waves. The majority of selling came from “new whales”—investors who accumulated BTC in the last 155 days—who cashed out as prices hit new highs. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders climbed above 1.05, indicating that coins were being sold at a 5% profit. Long-term holders showed SOPR spikes representing nearly 4x returns. These indicators closely mirror patterns observed during previous high-profit periods. Capital Rotation and Exchange Flows Indicate Risk-Off Shift Profit-taking wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Whales holding USDT, USDC, and WBTC on Ethereum also realized sizable gains, with some days in July seeing $40 million in profits across stablecoins. Meanwhile, exchange inflow data confirmed that more BTC—as much as 70,000 coins in a single day—was moved to exchanges, mirroring peaks in past profit waves. Rising inflows of altcoins reinforced the broader “risk-off” tone in the market. The Path Forward: Consolidation, Then Breakout? If history repeats, Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to enter a short-term consolidation phase before the next leg up. Previous cycles suggest that strong profit-taking is often followed by a healthy pause, not a prolonged decline. U.S. investor appetite has slightly weakened, as indicated by the Coinbase premium turning negative, but this, too, may be temporary. As the market cools and capital rotates, traders and long-term investors alike will be watching closely. The data suggests that while a pause is in motion, the next push higher may only be a few months away. Federal Reserve Keeps Rates at 4.25%-4.5% The Federal Reserve mai ntained interest rates at 4.25%-4.5% on July 30, marking the fifth consecutive meeting without change, while two governors dissented in favor of cuts for the first time since 1993. The decision triggered a market sell-off with the Dow fall ing over 300 points and cryptocurrency markets experiencing widespread declines before recovering key support levels. Earlier, cryptocurrency markets quickly recovered with Bitcoin defending the key $118,000 level and the global crypto market cap stabilizing above $3.8 trillion.

2025-07-31T18:22:22,"Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake could be worth $367M","Following in the President’s footsteps, his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are also making inroads in the crypto industry. According to a securities filing made public on Tuesday, Eric Trump is set to become one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto industry following a merger between Gryphon Digital Mining and American Bitcoin Corp. , which he cofounded. Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake could be worth $367M Eric Trump’s interest in a fledgling Bitcoin mining company may soon make him one of the wealthiest individuals in the U.S. crypto sector. According to a securities filing made public on Tuesday, Eric Trump, the second son of President Donald Trump, is set to receive 367 million shares in Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. as part of a merger between the publicly traded firm and American Bitcoin Corp., a company he co-founded in March. Gryphon shares were trading at roughly $1 on Thursday, which implies that the future value of Trump’s stake under current market conditions is a whopping $367M. President Trump has thrown the weight of the POTUS office behind cryptocurrencies, a sharp pivot from his first term when he was an unrelenting skeptic of the industry. In June, the president signed an executive order aimed at building a national Bitcoin reserve , and this week, he publicly advocated for ushering in what he called a “golden age of crypto” in the United States. Eric Trump is serving as the chief strategy officer for American Bitcoin, a role that carries a three-year advisory agreement but does not include financial compensation, according to the filing. He remains an executive within the Trump Organization and is involved in various family-owned ventures. The Trump family has stakes in the cryptocurrency industry A recent private sale of American Bitcoin shares pegged the value of the new stock at just 25 cents apiece, which would bring Trump’s stake down to approximately $92M. The filing did not disclose what Eric Trump or his brother, Donald Trump Jr., paid for their initial investments. American Bitcoin Corp. was created by merging the mining equipment of the Miami-based Hut 8 Corp. with a new corporate entity backed by the Trump sons and other unnamed investors. In a statement following the merger’s announcement, Hut 8 emphasized that the deal would combine its established mining operations with “Eric Trump’s commercial acumen, capital markets expertise, and commitment to the advancement of decentralized financial systems.” The newly merged company, which will retain the American Bitcoin name, is expected to go public in the coming weeks. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns about potential conflicts of interest concerning the Trump family’s deepening involvement in the crypto space. “Neither the President nor his family has ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” she said in a statement. At a major Bitcoin conference in May, Eric Trump appeared alongside other American Bitcoin executives and declared his family’s full support for the industry. “We have a president who loves this industry and is behind this industry 100%,” he said. “I’m telling you, we as a family could not be more excited about this.” Get seen where it counts.

2025-07-31T18:15:50,"US SEC unveils sweeping plans to regulate crypto: here’s what you need to know","The SEC is gearing up to overhaul how it handles crypto, in what could be a major shift for the digital asset world. Speaking on Thursday, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said he’s asked agency staff to begin drafting rules that offer more tailored oversight for crypto markets. That includes clearer definitions around when a token should be treated as a security, along with new disclosure requirements and possible exemptions built specifically for digital assets. For an industry that’s spent years in regulatory limbo, the move is being seen as a big win. Crypto firms and investors have long pushed for a rulebook that reflects the realities of blockchain-based trading, rather than forcing digital assets into frameworks built for traditional finance. The SEC’s initiative suggests Washington may finally be ready to meet them halfway. Crypto enters financial mainstream The SEC’s shift is part of a wider effort across the federal government to bring crypto into the fold of traditional finance, without turning a blind eye to the risks. The SEC has spent the past few years making headlines for chasing down sketchy token sales and classic pump-and-dump scams. But now, the agency’s trying to get ahead of the curve. Instead of just playing defense, it’s working to build a more forward-looking regulatory playbook that sets clear expectations before trouble starts. Early outlines suggest a wide net: rules for registering exchanges and tokens, safeguards against fraud and price manipulation, stronger investor protections, and updated cybersecurity standards tailored to the quirks of blockchain tech. It’s a shift in tone and a sign the SEC wants to rein in the chaos without shutting the door on innovation. And the SEC isn’t alone. Other arms of the federal government have also started to take crypto more seriously in 2025. In a striking move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency has told Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare for a future where borrowers can include certain crypto assets held on US-regulated exchanges, as part of their mortgage applications, without needing to sell them off. It’s a sign that digital assets are slowly but surely being woven into the fabric of the US financial system. A turning point for crypto What’s being dubbed “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill has delivered real movement for the digital asset space, with major legislation like the GENIUS Act now officially signed into law. After years of regulatory gray zones and mixed signals, lawmakers are finally moving toward a unified federal framework for crypto. The goal: give investors protection without choking off innovation. The White House and SEC are both on board, pushing not just to update securities laws but also to let crypto platforms handle custody and to craft disclosure rules that reflect how digital assets actually function. At its core, the goal is to lay down a regulatory foundation that’s clear and consistent—something the market’s been missing for years. It’s about giving investors more confidence while giving the industry space to grow responsibly. This latest push builds on a 2025 executive order and a working group report released just days before the SEC’s announcement, both of which called on Congress and regulators to move quickly on everything from tax treatment to capital markets oversight for digital assets. It’s a long time coming, but Washington finally seems ready to catch up.

2025-07-31T18:15:29,"Seoul Watchdogs Sound Alarm on Upbit, Bithumb Crypto Lending Products","South Korean financial watchdogs in Seoul have sounded an alarm regarding crypto lending and margin trading services recently introduced by major exchanges Upbit and Bithumb, citing concerns over high-leverage trading operations. The two exchanges, Upbit holding the position as Korea’s dominant crypto platform and Bithumb ranking second, collectively control the majority of the nation’s digital asset trading volume. According to a July 30 local report , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) convened meetings with executives from Korea’s five leading cryptocurrency exchanges to address these new financial products and voice regulatory concerns regarding leverage-associated risks and potential deficiencies in investor protection frameworks. Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Growing Regulatory Compliance for Crypto Lending and Margin Trading Services Bithumb initiated its cryptocurrency lending service on July 4, allowing users to borrow digital assets using their existing cryptocurrency holdings or Korean won as security, offering leverage ratios up to 4:1. The service encompasses 10 digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether. Coinciding with Bithumb’s launch, Upbit rolled out a comparable lending platform supporting three cryptocurrencies: Tether, Bitcoin, and Ripple. The platform is similarly collateralized by crypto assets or traditional currency deposits. These platforms allow traders to borrow cryptocurrencies they don’t possess and execute short sales , generating profits when asset values decline, essentially creating short-selling mechanisms within the virtual asset marketplace. Financial authorities have expressed strong concern that these exchanges may be contravening Korea’s Lending Business Act through their high-risk operations. They particularly pointed out Bithumb’s 4:1 leverage ratio, which surpasses the 2:1 leverage limitation established for Korea’s traditional equity markets. Ki Young Ju, a Seoul-based crypto investor and founder of CryptoQuant, has also noted the dangerous nature of excessive margin trading, particularly when leverage exceeds 4:1 ratio. In a recent social media post, Ju emphasized that utilizing leverage above 5:1 exponentially increases the probability of liquidation within a 24-hour period, noting: “Bitcoin moved more than 2% on most days (82%) this month. If you play 50x Russian roulette every day, the chance of surviving a week is only 0.000612%.” Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Following regulatory pressure, Upbit discontinued its Tether lending service, citing concerns that providing stablecoin lending in exchange for fees could be construed as consumer lending activity, potentially subjecting the platform to Korea’s lending regulations. Bithumb responded by modifying its service framework while preserving its 4:1 leverage structure. The exchange has temporarily suspended new lending applications due to an exhausted lending inventory. The FSC and FSS are planning to establish an industry collaborative task force to develop voluntary self-regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency lending and margin trading operations. South Korean Crypto Firms Grow From Gambling Status to Corporate Ventures These developments occur amid a series of investment sector restrictions as Seoul regulators prioritize consumer protection measures. On July 23, the FSS advised asset management companies to avoid “excessive inclusion” of cryptocurrency-related stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy in their ETF portfolios. However, some regulatory constraints may be reconsidered as South Korea considers reclassifying cryptocurrency trading and brokerage operations as “venture companies,” a designation that would provide access to government subsidies, tax benefits, and financial assistance programs. Current legislation, implemented in 2018, specifically prevents blockchain-based cryptocurrency firms from obtaining venture certification, categorizing them alongside gambling establishments and entertainment venues. The proposed regulatory amendment seeks to reverse this classification, potentially legitimizing the country’s expanding digital asset industry. Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Venture company status in South Korea provides numerous advantages, including tax reductions and enhanced access to government-backed financing programs.

The filing starts a new stage of using crypto in traditional finance, allowing in-kind compensation and passive income. Jito Labs , along with Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute, filed a petition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the usage of Solana liquid staking tokens in ETF and ETP. JUST IN: Jito Labs, Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute urge the SEC to approve Liquid Staking Tokens in ETPs. They say LSTs boost liquidity, resilience, and cut risk, pushing for greenlight in upcoming Solana ETFs under new SEC rules. pic.twitter.com/XdAixF7XqB — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 31, 2025 The organizations are advocating for the usage of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) as the main type of staking in ETP or ETF. Solana allows for regular SOL staking, but there is also liquid staking, which includes both passive income and a newly issued token for additional operations. The filing urged to include liquid staking for eight products that filed S-1 forms with the SEC on June 13, 2025. Jito Labs urges the spread of liquid staking tokens to ETP and possibly ETF For now, only ETPs allow for staking, but the practice may spread to ETFs with additional requests. The SEC is also still exploring the legal side of staking , for both Ethereum and Solana ETFs, while fund issuers are pushing to include various forms of staking and in-kind compensation. Jito Labs and its associates claimed LSTs are capital-efficient and low-risk, and can benefit ETP investors. So far, the SEC has not explicitly addressed LSTs on Solana or other networks, though there are general guidelines on proof-of-stake networks. LSTs can work as a proxy for direct staking, and the SEC is urged to consider the mechanism for Solana and other chains. LSTs are most common on Ethereum and Solana, and are a tool to secure the network, while also putting idle tokens to work. Requests for staking started in 2024 The initial ETF and ETP filings omitted the issue of staking, as they focused on BTC products. The inclusion of Ethereum and later Solana ETP filings raised the issue of staking. The first filings avoided the topic due to technical uncertainties, taxation issues, and the fear of pushing crypto innovation too quickly to mainstream investors. Currently, Solana carries over $7.8B in value through its liquid staking tokens. Most of the tokens are issued by validators or other infrastructure projects on the Solana chain, among which JitoSOL is the leader. One of the risks for LSTs is their relative volatility. While SOL traded at $177.75, LSTs ranged between $220 and $200. Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL) traded at $218.57. Marinade’s token traded as high as $235.06. LSTs are often used in DeFi protocols and have varying price discovery mechanisms. There is no clear standard for staking service, and each has relatively complex rules. The biggest risk for LSTs is ‘slashing’, where flawed validators can have their tokens confiscated. Therefore, some LST issuers are competing to offer safe or vetted services. Recently, Marinade Finance slashed and restaked 340,000 SOL, removing validators from its list. The process is not entirely detailed to mainstream finance regulators, and the SEC will have to research the conditions of staking and slashing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-07-31T18:10:12,"Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses: Unveiling the Alarming Drop","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses: Unveiling the Alarming Drop In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, keeping an eye on fundamental metrics is crucial for understanding market health. Recently, a significant shift has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: a noticeable decline in Bitcoin daily active addresses . What does this intriguing development signify for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? Is it a fleeting blip or a signal of deeper underlying trends? What Exactly Happened to Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? According to data shared by Santiment on X (formerly Twitter), the landscape of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity saw a considerable change throughout July. Specifically: In early July, Bitcoin daily active addresses were robust, ranging between 570,000 and 800,000, indicating healthy user engagement. By July 31st, this number sharply declined to approximately 380,000, a significant contraction in unique addresses participating in transactions. In contrast, Ethereum demonstrated remarkable stability during the same period, maintaining around 511,000 active addresses, offering a compelling point of comparison. This divergence highlights distinct user behaviors and network priorities, prompting a deeper dive into what drives such fluctuations. Why Do Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses Matter? Understanding Network Health When we talk about Bitcoin daily active addresses , we refer to the unique blockchain addresses active as either a sender or receiver on a given day. This metric is a vital indicator of a cryptocurrency network’s health and utility: Organic Adoption & Utility: High active addresses suggest genuine adoption, implying more people use Bitcoin for transactions, not just holding. Network Demand: Increased activity can correlate with higher demand for block space and transaction fees. User Engagement: Reflects community engagement; a vibrant network signifies a healthy, growing ecosystem. Market Sentiment: A sustained decline can precede or coincide with waning investor interest and bearish sentiment, while an increase signals renewed interest. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing Bitcoin’s fundamental strength beyond just its price chart. Decoding the Drop: Potential Factors Behind the Decline in Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses A significant drop in Bitcoin daily active addresses is rarely due to a single cause, but rather a confluence of market sentiment, technological shifts, and broader economic conditions. Potential reasons include: Bear Market Fatigue: Prolonged bear markets lead to “hodler” behavior, reducing daily on-chain transactions as users wait out downturns. Speculative activity also wanes. Consolidation of Holdings: Large holders may consolidate Bitcoin across fewer addresses, especially when moving to secure, custodial solutions. Shift to Layer-2 Solutions: As networks like the Lightning Network mature, more transactions occur off the main blockchain, not reflected in base-layer active addresses. Exchange Activity & User Onboarding: Changes in exchange wallet management, rebalancing, or reduced high-frequency trading can impact numbers. Fewer new users or less active existing users also contribute. Seasonal & Macro Factors: Crypto markets experience seasonal dips. Broader macroeconomic concerns, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of positive news can slow network engagement. Consider these factors holistically rather than jumping to conclusions based on a single metric. How Does Ethereum’s Stability Contrast with Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? The resilience of Ethereum’s active addresses, maintaining around 511,000 while Bitcoin daily active addresses saw a steep decline, provides a compelling contrast. This divergence can be attributed to several key differences in their ecosystems and primary use cases: Diverse Ecosystem & Utility: Ethereum’s strength lies in its robust dApp ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, Web3), driving consistent transaction volume. Bitcoin primarily serves as a store of value. Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum’s smart contracts allow complex interactions beyond simple transfers (lending, staking, gaming), boosting active address counts. Developer Activity: High developer activity on Ethereum leads to continuous innovation, attracting and retaining users. Staking & DeFi Participation: Ethereum 2.0 and liquid staking incentivize long-term holding and DeFi participation, contributing to a stable user base. This comparison shows that while both are leading cryptocurrencies, their utility and user engagement models lead to different on-chain behavior during market fluctuations. Table: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Active Address Trends (July) Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Active Addresses (Early July) 570,000 – 800,000 ~511,000 (stable) Active Addresses (July 31st) ~380,000 ~511,000 (stable) Trend in July Sharp Decline Consistent Stability Primary Utility Focus Store of Value, P2P Cash Smart Contracts, dApps, DeFi, NFTs Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Changing Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses For investors, a decline in Bitcoin daily active addresses can be a cause for concern, but it’s crucial to approach such data with a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Metrics: Don’t panic. Look beyond active addresses to transaction volume, miner revenue, and long-term holder behavior for a holistic view. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s core value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset remains. Short-term fluctuations don’t negate its long-term potential, especially with Layer-2 adoption. Consider Macroeconomic Context: Global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events influence investor sentiment and on-chain activity. Evaluate Layer-2 Growth: Monitor the Lightning Network’s growth. More off-chain transactions indicate network efficiency, even if base-layer counts are impacted. Stay Informed & Skeptical: Verify data sources and understand metric methodologies. Market intelligence should inform, not dictate, your strategy. Patience and research are paramount. Conclusion: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Network? The recent drop in Bitcoin daily active addresses to 380,000, as highlighted by Santiment, reminds us of the crypto market’s dynamic nature. While this decline might signal reduced network engagement, a deeper analysis reveals a complex interplay of market cycles, investor behavior, Layer-2 maturation, and the distinct utility of blockchains like Ethereum. Evaluating Bitcoin’s health requires a holistic view, integrating various on-chain metrics, market sentiment, and broader macroeconomic trends. This shift isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario but an invitation for a more nuanced perspective on digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin daily active addresses? Bitcoin daily active addresses refer to the number of unique blockchain addresses that were active as either a sender or a receiver of Bitcoin on a given day. Why did Bitcoin’s active addresses drop in July? The drop in July could be attributed to a combination of factors including bear market fatigue, consolidation of holdings by large entities, increased use of Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, and general macroeconomic conditions affecting investor sentiment. How does Ethereum’s active address count compare to Bitcoin’s? During July, Ethereum maintained a more stable active address count of around 511,000, contrasting with Bitcoin’s sharp decline. This is largely due to Ethereum’s diverse ecosystem of dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract functionality. Does a drop in active addresses mean Bitcoin is failing? Not necessarily. While a decline can indicate reduced short-term engagement, it doesn’t automatically mean failure. It’s crucial to consider other on-chain metrics and broader market trends for a complete picture. What other metrics should I look at to assess Bitcoin’s health? Beyond active addresses, consider transaction volume, miner revenue, exchange inflows/outflows, long-term holder behavior, and the growth of Layer-2 solutions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin’s network health. How do Layer-2 solutions impact active address counts? Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network handle transactions off the main blockchain. While this improves scalability and reduces fees, these off-chain transactions are not typically counted in the base-layer’s daily active addresses, potentially leading to a lower reported number even if overall activity is high.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 145,200 followers on the social media platform X that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, Bitcoin may increase more than 19% from its current value. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. “As long as the $105,450 support holds, Bitcoin could be on track for a move to $125,230 and potentially $141,770, based on the short-term holder cost basis.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also uses the cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) metric, which looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD is used to spot potential market tops and bottoms. “The next Bitcoin top could be at $149,679!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $118,250 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours. Next up, Martinez says that Ethereum may increase more than 35% from its current value based on pricing bands derived from ETH ‘s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator, which is used to identify the key levels of support. “As long as the $3,300 support holds, Ethereum could be on track for a move to $4,220 and potentially $5,140, based on the MVRV Pricing Bands.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ETH is trading for $3,787 at time of writing, down marginally on the day. Looking at XRP , the analyst says that the payments token may be forming a bullish reversal pattern on the four hour chart and potentially increase by more than 16% from its current value. “XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60.” Source: Ali Martinez/X XRP is trading for $3.10 at time of writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator – which is used to determine potential points of reversal for an asset – suggests Dogecoin ( DOGE ) may soon have a bounce. “Dogecoin is ready for another leg up as the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the daily chart!” Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading for $0.21 at time of writing, down 1.6% on the day.

Ripple Exec Says It’s Not What You Think","According to comments from Ripple CTO David Schwartz, XRP is still at the heart of Ripple’s payments system, even as the company highlights its new stablecoin, RLUSD. Related Reading: XRP Traders Pull Back $2.4B—Brace For Impact Or Buy The Dip? Ripple’s lead tech officer stressed that XRP remains the primary bridge asset in cross-border transactions—and that wider use of the XRP Ledger will keep boosting the altcoin’s utility and value. XRP Remains Core To Ripple Payments In a recent exchange, an XRP supporter pointed out that Ripple now mentions RLUSD more often than XRP. Schwartz replied that he doesn’t have the exact figures on hand, but he’s sure that Ripple uses XRP far more than any other digital asset for its payments service. I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset. I think stablecoins win for collateral use cases (volatile collateral is annoying) and edge use cases (volatility at the on/off ramps is also… — David ‘JoelKatz’ Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 30, 2025 Based on reports, XRP still dominates as the bridge currency when moving money from one fiat to another. That role helps institutions send funds quickly and cheaply, even when market swings might make a stablecoin less ideal. Ripple launched RLUSD in December 2024 to meet demand for price stability. According to Schwartz, stablecoins like RLUSD make sense in use cases that depend on a fixed value—such as when firms use crypto assets as collateral or enter and exit markets without risking 5% swings overnight. He noted that Hidden Road, one of Ripple’s big partners that works with over 300 institutions, chose RLUSD as its main collateral asset in May 2025. That move shows RLUSD’s appeal for stability-focused tasks. Stablecoin Role Versus Altcoin Utility Schwartz drew a clear line between the two tokens. For tasks where price predictability matters most, a stablecoin helps avoid hiccups. But for the majority of payments, he believes a liquid asset like XRP does a better job—unless someone wants to avoid risk entirely. Holding major digital assets can capture upside, and XRP fits that need better than cash, he said. Adoption Drives XRP Demand Looking ahead, Schwartz stressed that real-world use of the XRP Ledger will naturally drive more demand for the crypto. As more projects and institutions tap into XRPL’s fast transaction speeds and low fees, they’ll need XRP to power each move. That design makes it harder to sidestep the coin’s native token than it is on other networks, where developers can wrap or bypass the base coin entirely. Schwartz’s remarks arrive amid community worries that XRP is being sidelined in favor of stablecoins. The choice by Hidden Road to back RLUSD raised eyebrows back in May 2025. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert XRP’s Use Case But by highlighting how deeply XRP is woven into XRPL’s mechanics—and reminding investors that the altcoin’s volume still outstrips any other asset in Ripple Payments—Schwartz sent a clear message: XRP’s use won’t fade, even as stablecoins gain ground. Based on these comments, Ripple appears to be taking a two-pronged approach: use RLUSD where price stability is critical, and rely on XRP for its proven liquidity and built-in role on the ledger. That strategy could help keep both tokens busy in different parts of the crypto economy, ensuring XRP stays relevant even as new products emerge.

This article takes a close look at three major platforms, Stake.com, LeoVegas, and Spartans , to find out who really delivers the most worthwhile crypto casino rewards in 2025. From bonus terms to actual usability, here’s what players need to know before picking a platform. Stake.com: High Bonus Offers With Heavy Strings Attached Stake.com definitely knows how to get attention. Its welcome bonuses are hard to miss, with flashy percentages and promises of major returns. But if you dig into the details, the catch becomes clear. There are significant wagering requirements, meaning players must bet the bonus several times before they’re allowed to cash out anything. These conditions vary based on game type, which only adds to the confusion. For many players, especially those new to the platform, this makes the bonus feel more like an obstacle. While Stake.com looks great on the surface, its crypto casino rewards lose their appeal once the fine print comes into play. LeoVegas: Personalized Bonuses With Limited Crypto Support LeoVegas tries to set itself apart with a personalized approach. It lets users choose from various bonus types depending on the games they prefer, which sounds convenient at first. But there’s a downside, especially for those using cryptocurrencies. Many of LeoVegas’ bonuses are tied to specific fiat currencies. If you’re depositing in crypto, or even just outside popular regions, you may find you’re not eligible or your options are limited. That makes things tricky for users hoping for seamless crypto casino rewards. It might be a solid pick for EUR or GBP players, but it doesn’t quite work as well for crypto-first users. Spartans: Honest Bonus Terms With Full Crypto Compatibility Spartans takes a much simpler route, and that’s where it shines. The welcome offer here is straightforward: a 300% match bonus up to $200 with a low $5 minimum deposit. What makes it different is the clear, upfront information. There’s a 35x wagering requirement for casino and 10x for sports, and all conditions are spelled out plainly. Crypto deposits are fully accepted without any conversion problems, and the bonus funds arrive fast. Plus, there’s a 10x cap on bonus withdrawals, so players know from the start what to expect. This transparency makes Spartans stand out as a top choice for players who want real crypto casino rewards without having to decode complicated rules. Clear Value Beats Flashy Promises This isn’t just about the biggest numbers, it’s about how easy those bonuses are to use. Stake.com leans heavily on flashy offers but makes players jump through too many hoops. LeoVegas looks flexible but falls short when it comes to crypto accessibility. Spartans does the opposite. It offers a simple match, fast access to funds, and conditions that anyone can understand. That’s exactly what most players want, clarity, not complexity. For those focused on getting the most out of their crypto casino rewards, Spartans clearly puts users first. Crypto Bonuses That Work the Same for Everyone Another area where Spartans gets it right is crypto support. While Stake.com and LeoVegas offer crypto options, the experience isn’t always smooth. You might face different interfaces, restrictions on certain promotions, or bonus terms that change based on your token. Spartans eliminates that confusion. Whether you’re using Bitcoin, USDT, or other supported currencies, the bonus remains the same. There are no surprise fees or exclusions. For players who prefer betting exclusively with crypto, this kind of consistency makes Spartans one of the few platforms where crypto casino rewards work exactly as expected. Final Thoughts Players shouldn’t have to crunch numbers just to figure out if a bonus is worth it. In 2025, users want simple value and clear rules, not a long list of exceptions. While Stake.com and LeoVegas each have strengths, their bonus structures often create more hassle than help. Spartans flips that script. From your first deposit, you get straightforward terms, reliable crypto support, and bonuses that are easy to use. In a space where many offers sound better than they are, Spartans delivers what it promises: crypto casino rewards that actually make sense. And in the long run, that’s what really matters.
