2025-07-31T16:58:25,"Crypto Governance Crunch: Nearly 1 in 4 North American CFOs Plot 2027 Treasury Shift","Key Takeaways: A Deloitte survey shows 23% of North American CFOs expect to integrate cryptocurrency into treasury operations by 2027. Beyond financial use, crypto adoption could reshape corporate governance, vendor management, and workforce skill requirements. Stablecoin regulation and CBDC rollouts may influence whether crypto becomes a mainstream corporate settlement mechanism. Nearly a quarter of chief financial officers in North America expect their finance departments to be using cryptocurrency treasury within two years, according to a Deloitte survey published on July 31. The survey, conducted from June 4 to June 18, polled 200 CFOs from companies generating at least $1 billion in annual revenues. Concerns Over Volatility and Controls Deloitte found that 23% of respondents said their treasury teams will utilize cryptocurrency for either payments or investments by 2027, with the figure rising to almost 40% among CFOs at firms with $10 billion or more in revenue. The report noted that 43% of CFOs cited price volatility as their top concern in adopting non-stable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. Accounting complexity and controls were identified by 42%, followed by a lack of industry regulation at 40%. Regulatory uncertainty has been heightened by recent U.S. policy shifts. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formed a crypto task force in January before rescinding prior accounting guidance, prompting the Financial Accounting Standards Board to update its own rules in March. SEC establishes new crypto ETF listing standards enabling approximately dozen major digital assets to gain approval by October through streamlined framework. #SEC #ETFs https://t.co/grlJtGb5tH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Fifteen percent of CFOs indicated they expect to accept stablecoins for payments within two years, with the proportion again higher for the largest companies. Forty-five percent of respondents pointed to improved customer privacy as a benefit, while 39% cited efficiency in cross-border payments. Corporate Treasury Use Cases Expanding Beyond treasury functions, CFOs identified supply chain tracking as a key application. More than half said they expect to use non-stable cryptocurrencies for this purpose, and nearly as many indicated the same for stablecoins. The survey also showed that discussions about cryptocurrency are becoming common at senior levels. Thirty-seven percent of CFOs said they had spoken with their boards about crypto adoption, while 41% had discussed it with CIOs, and 34% with banks or lenders. Only 2% reported no engagement with stakeholders on the issue. The growing dialogue suggests corporations are weighing not only direct financial use cases but also how digital assets could reshape vendor relationships, treasury systems, and compliance frameworks. At the same time, the trajectory of stablecoin regulation and central bank digital currency initiatives could determine whether CFOs view crypto primarily as a niche investment tool or as an eventual component of mainstream corporate payment and settlement systems. Frequently Asked Questions How might corporate crypto adoption affect internal audit practices? CFOs may require updated audit frameworks to manage blockchain transactions, ensuring transparency, risk control, and compliance with evolving accounting standards. What skills will finance departments need to manage crypto use? Departments will likely need expertise in blockchain technology, cross-border settlement systems, cybersecurity, and compliance with multi-jurisdictional regulations. Could crypto adoption impact vendor relationships? Yes. Crypto-based payments and supply chain tracking may streamline reconciliation processes and provide transparency in procurement and logistics. How might stablecoin regulation influence CFO adoption timelines? Clearer rules could accelerate adoption by reducing regulatory risk and encouraging CFOs to view stablecoins as viable settlement assets.

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, the Republican politician says that the next US president will have to start reducing government spending as borrowing continues to soar, threatening the dollar’s global dominance. The US debt just ballooned by more than $519 billion between July 3rd and July 28th, reaching a total of more than $36.8 trillion. “Your real question is, how do you keep the dollar the world currency? I think the more that we go in and sanction we’re pushing countries to learn to go around the dollar. I think President Trump has done a very smart move against the BRICS, what they were trying to do. But it all comes down to debt. That’s why debt is our greatest threat to America, and you cannot avoid it any longer.” McCarthy says that if the next president doesn’t materially address the debt, then significant safety net programs like Social Security may face deep cuts. “The next President is going to have the debt crisis… and the challenge is, if you look in the past, the Democrats had the ‘Blue Dog.’ Those were Democrats who cared about debt. They’re no longer there. No one in Congress has been elected saying they’re going to balance the budget. The country has to be educated on this, and Congress is going to have to act, because Social Security in the next administration is either going to take a 24% cut or [it will] do something about it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-31T16:55:11,"Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Holdings Witness Explosive $47.3 Billion Surge in 2025","BitcoinWorld Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Holdings Witness Explosive $47.3 Billion Surge in 2025 In a groundbreaking development that’s sending ripples through both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds, publicly-listed companies have made an astonishing investment in Bitcoin this year. According to a recent report from CEX.IO, corporate treasuries have collectively acquired a staggering $47.3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025. This monumental figure not only highlights a significant shift in corporate asset management but also dwarfs the $31.7 billion inflows seen by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the same period. This raises a crucial question: What’s driving this immense appetite for Bitcoin among some of the world’s largest enterprises? Why Are Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Portfolios Exploding? The surge in publicly-listed companies Bitcoin acquisitions isn’t a mere coincidence; it’s a calculated strategic move driven by several compelling factors. Corporations are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to safeguard and grow their capital in an evolving global economy. Here are some key drivers: Inflation Hedge and Value Preservation: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating inflation rates, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against currency debasement. Companies are seeking to protect their balance sheets from the erosion of purchasing power, and Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Smart financial management dictates diversification. By adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves, publicly-listed companies are diversifying their asset portfolios beyond cash, bonds, and traditional equities. This helps mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single asset class. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Strategy: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s commitment to innovation and adaptability. It positions them as forward-thinking entities willing to explore new technologies and financial paradigms, which can attract a new generation of investors and customers. Competitive Advantage: Early adopters of Bitcoin among publicly-listed companies can gain a competitive edge. It can enhance their brand image, attract talent interested in the crypto space, and potentially open up new revenue streams or payment solutions. The CEX.IO report underscores that this isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporate treasuries perceive and manage their long-term financial health. The sheer volume of $47.3 billion in direct purchases by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries suggests a deep-seated conviction in the asset’s future. Beyond ETFs: The Corporate Treasury Revolution in Bitcoin While spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly garnered significant attention and facilitated broader institutional access to Bitcoin, the direct purchases by publicly-listed companies represent a distinct and arguably more profound trend. What sets this corporate treasury revolution apart? Direct Ownership and Control: Unlike ETFs, which provide indirect exposure, corporate treasury investments mean companies directly hold and control their Bitcoin. This implies a higher level of commitment and belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as it requires navigating custody, security, and accounting complexities. Strategic Intent vs. Investment Vehicle: ETFs are primarily investment vehicles for a wide range of investors seeking exposure without direct management. Corporate treasury allocations, however, are often part of a broader strategic decision to optimize balance sheets, manage risk, and position the company for future growth in the digital economy. Impact on Market Dynamics: The consistent, large-scale buying by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries can have a more stable and sustained impact on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market capitalization compared to the often more volatile inflows and outflows of ETF products. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market, moving beyond retail and speculative interest to fundamental adoption by established corporate entities. It’s a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a global reserve asset. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for Publicly-listed Companies Adopting Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, investing in Bitcoin is not without its complexities, especially for publicly-listed companies. Corporate treasuries venturing into this space must carefully consider several challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant fluctuations, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings reports. Managing this volatility requires robust risk management strategies and a long-term investment horizon. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Companies must stay abreast of changing laws regarding taxation, accounting, and compliance to avoid legal pitfalls. Accounting and Reporting: Current accounting standards, particularly in the U.S. under GAAP, treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which can lead to complex impairment charges if its value drops. This requires careful financial planning and transparent reporting to shareholders. Security and Custody: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin necessitates top-tier security measures to prevent hacks and theft. Companies must choose reputable and secure custody solutions, often involving multi-signature wallets and cold storage. Shareholder and Stakeholder Skepticism: Some traditional investors and stakeholders may view Bitcoin investments as too risky or speculative. Companies must be prepared to clearly articulate their rationale and long-term strategy to gain buy-in. Addressing these challenges proactively is crucial for publicly-listed companies looking to successfully integrate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. It requires thorough due diligence and expert consultation. Strategic Insights: Actionable Steps for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption For publicly-listed companies considering or expanding their Bitcoin holdings, a structured and well-thought-out approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Comprehensive Due Diligence: Before any investment, perform extensive research into Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand its risks and potential rewards in the context of your company’s specific financial goals. Develop a Robust Risk Management Framework: Establish clear policies for allocation limits, rebalancing strategies, and security protocols. Consider insurance options for digital assets and engage with professional custody providers. Engage Expert Consultants: Work with legal, tax, and accounting professionals specializing in cryptocurrency. Their expertise can help navigate the complex regulatory and financial reporting requirements. Ensure Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate your Bitcoin strategy to shareholders, employees, and the public. Explain the rationale behind the investment, the expected benefits, and the measures taken to mitigate risks. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Publicly-listed companies should approach their Bitcoin investments with a long-term horizon, focusing on its potential as a store of value rather than short-term speculative gains. By following these steps, publicly-listed companies can build a solid foundation for sustainable and responsible Bitcoin adoption , ensuring it aligns with their overall corporate strategy. The Future of Publicly-listed Companies and Bitcoin: What’s Next? The $47.3 billion figure for 2025 is not just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of a burgeoning trend. As more publicly-listed companies gain confidence and experience with Bitcoin, we can anticipate several key developments: Increased Corporate Adoption: The success stories of early adopters like MicroStrategy and Tesla, combined with the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, will likely encourage more companies to follow suit. Maturation of Supporting Infrastructure: We will see continued development in secure custody solutions, specialized financial services for corporate crypto treasuries, and clearer regulatory frameworks. New Use Cases: Beyond a store of value, companies might explore using Bitcoin for international payments, supply chain finance, or even as collateral for loans, further integrating it into their operational strategies. Impact on Traditional Finance: The increasing embrace of Bitcoin by publicly-listed companies will continue to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto economy, fostering greater understanding and collaboration. The journey of publicly-listed companies into the world of Bitcoin is just beginning, but the pace and scale of adoption in 2025 suggest a transformative era for corporate finance. The unprecedented $47.3 billion investment by publicly-listed companies in Bitcoin during 2025 marks a pivotal moment in the digital asset landscape. This figure, significantly outpacing ETF inflows, underscores a profound shift in corporate treasury management, driven by a desire for diversification, inflation hedging, and strategic innovation. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain, the proactive steps taken by these pioneering corporations signal a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its potential to reshape the future of finance. The corporate embrace of Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea; it’s a powerful and accelerating trend that promises to redefine how businesses manage their wealth in the 21st century. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is driving publicly-listed companies to buy Bitcoin? A1: Publicly-listed companies are primarily driven by the desire to hedge against inflation, diversify their treasury assets, embrace technological innovation, and potentially gain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Q2: How does corporate Bitcoin adoption differ from spot Bitcoin ETF inflows? A2: Corporate Bitcoin adoption involves direct ownership and control of Bitcoin on a company’s balance sheet, signifying a strategic treasury decision. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, conversely, offer indirect exposure to Bitcoin as an investment vehicle for a broader range of investors without direct management. Q3: What are the main risks for companies holding Bitcoin? A3: Key risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility impacting financial reports, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, complex accounting and reporting standards, the need for robust security and custody solutions, and potential skepticism from traditional shareholders. Q4: Which publicly-listed companies are notable Bitcoin holders? A4: While the CEX.IO report refers to 2025 data, historically, companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have been prominent publicly-listed corporate holders of Bitcoin, inspiring others to consider similar strategies. Q5: Will more companies adopt Bitcoin in the future? A5: Given the significant investments in 2025 and the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, it is highly probable that more publicly-listed companies will explore and adopt Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies in the coming years. Q6: How can companies manage the volatility of Bitcoin? A6: Companies can manage Bitcoin’s volatility by adopting a long-term investment horizon, implementing clear risk management frameworks, setting allocation limits, and utilizing secure, professional custody solutions to protect their assets.

2025-07-31T16:52:15,"Bitcoin Mining Goes Institutional – But Can It Survive Tariffs, AI Grid Wars, and Fee Collapse?","In 2025, Bitcoin mining is no longer just a competition over hashpower and block rewards—it has evolved into a full-scale infrastructure war, where access to energy, geopolitical positioning, and integration with emerging technologies like AI define who survives and who fades out. According to the newly released Bitcoin Mining Market Review and Key Trends authored by Nico Smid, research analyst at GoMining Institutional, and Fakhul Miah, managing director at GoMining Institutional, the industry now finds itself locked in a struggle with one of the world’s fastest-growing tech verticals: artificial intelligence. AI hyperscalers are demanding huge amounts of electricity for model training and deployment, putting them on a direct collision course with Bitcoin miners, who also rely on affordable, high-volume power to remain profitable. This competition has triggered what the report calls a “power crunch,” forcing mining companies to rethink site selection, energy procurement, and geopolitical risk in real time. The competition for electricity is no longer limited to internal mining rivalries—it has gone external. Major players like Riot Platforms have paused a 600 MW expansion, while Iris Energy has shifted away from pure BTC mining to allocate capacity toward AI cloud services. On February 13, Riot Platforms also anno unced that it is actively pursuing potential partnerships within the AI and HPC sectors. Bitcoin miner @RiotPlatforms eyes AI and HPC as Bitcoin transactions slump. #Bitcoin #AI #Mining https://t.co/9lab9MJy32 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 13, 2025 As nations attempt to balance power grids and prioritize forward-looking technologies, miners are being priced out, regulated against, or simply pushed aside, claims the report. Institutional Capital Pours in, but Miners Are Squeezed The report notes that this crunch comes at a time when institutional demand for Bitcoin has never been higher. Wall Street has poured billions into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , and the U.S. government has officially recognized the asset by forming a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The result is a paradox: demand for Bitcoin is soaring, but the supply-side infrastructure—mining—is becoming more fragile. While capital floods into ETFs, miners face rising operating costs, compressed fees, and restricted energy access. Hash price has declined sharply post-halving, and transaction fee revenue has collapsed to less than 1% of miner income. Even as Bitcoin becomes more embedded in institutional portfolios and public balance sheets, the ability to mint new coins is under siege. This growing disconnect between Bitcoin’s financialization and the economic sustainability of mining is one of the report’s core warnings. Miners Turn to Financial Engineering to Survive To survive this high-cost, post-halving environment, miners are evolving into financial tacticians. No longer just hardware operators, leading firms are now using Bitcoin-backed loans, convertible notes, and creative equity structures to raise capital without liquidating their BTC reserves. The report identifies this trend as “the rise of the financially engineered miner,” where the ability to model capital stack scenarios is as important as mining efficiency. The shift marks a turning point in how mining companies operate. Access to energy is still paramount, but access to capital markets—and the sophistication to operate within them—is now equally essential. As mining companies adapt to lower margins and greater volatility, their financial survival may hinge on how well they can balance debt, equity, and retained BTC while preparing for further pressure from AI, regulation, and tariffs. Legacy Hardware Feels the Pain The report also shines a light on the economic pressure facing legacy ASIC hardware. The S19 generation of miners, which still accounts for roughly 25% of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, is fast approaching obsolescence. Profitability data shows that S19 units operating at electricity costs above $0.06/kWh are already unprofitable unless the hash price exceeds $60—a rarity in 2025. For operators paying more than $0.05/kWh, even slight hash price drops can push them into the red. While the S19 has been a workhorse since its release five years ago, it is now a liability for many mining farms. The narrowing profit margins are an indicator of how quickly economic viability can shift, particularly in an industry facing both internal halving events and external competition from AI infrastructure players, GoMining Institutional reports. Outlook: More Than Just Block Rewards The report concludes that the first half of 2025 has revealed that Bitcoin mining is no longer a closed system. It’s now a frontline industry operating at the intersection of capital, energy, and compute. As the network seeks equilibrium after April’s halving, miners must make tough decisions about scale, strategy, and survival. The second half of the year promises no less intensity—but the winners will be those who can work within capital markets as well as they can manage hashpower.

2025-07-31T16:50:11,"Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Mysterious Transfer Rocks Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Mysterious Transfer Rocks Crypto Markets The cryptocurrency world thrives on intrigue, and few events capture attention quite like the sudden stirrings of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale . These enigmatic entities, holding vast sums of Bitcoin, often remain silent for years, their wallets untouched. But when they move, the entire market takes notice, sending ripples of speculation and analysis across the digital asset landscape. Recently, a particularly ancient Bitcoin whale , a true relic from the early days of crypto, has made a significant move, sparking widespread discussion about its potential implications for the market. What Just Happened with This Ancient Bitcoin Whale? According to on-chain analytics shared by ai_9684xtpa on X, a Bitcoin whale that has held a staggering 3,963 BTC since 2010—a truly remarkable feat of long-term conviction—has finally stirred. This ‘sleeping giant’ has transferred 180 BTC, valued at approximately $21.25 million at the time of the transfer, to an address known to be linked with market makers. This isn’t an isolated incident; the same whale is suspected to have offloaded a larger sum of 330 BTC, worth around $39 million, over the past week alone. The receiving address has a history of interactions with prominent market participants like B2C2, Galaxy, and Coinbase, suggesting a deliberate move into liquidity channels. To put this into perspective, imagine a treasure chest buried for over a decade, suddenly opening and releasing a portion of its riches. The market’s natural reaction is to wonder: Why now? What does this mean? Is this the beginning of a larger sale, or simply a strategic reallocation? These are the questions that arise when a Bitcoin whale makes its presence felt. Who Are These Bitcoin Whales, and Why Do They Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin whales are the largest creatures. They are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin, often enough to influence market prices with their trades. Their significance stems from several factors: Market Impact: A single large order from a whale can significantly shift supply and demand dynamics, leading to price volatility. Liquidity: Their movements, especially to exchanges or market makers, can either add or remove liquidity from the market. Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment. If whales are accumulating, it can signal bullishness; if they are distributing, it might suggest bearishness. Early Adopters: Many long-dormant whales are early adopters of Bitcoin, meaning they acquired their holdings when prices were incredibly low. Their decisions carry a historical weight and often reflect deep insights into Bitcoin’s long-term value. This particular Bitcoin whale , having held its coins since 2010, represents a class of holders who witnessed Bitcoin’s journey from obscurity to a global phenomenon. Their moves are not taken lightly by the market. The Market Maker Connection: What Does It Imply? The fact that the 180 BTC was sent to a market maker-linked address is a crucial detail. But what exactly is a market maker, and why is this connection significant? What is a Market Maker? A market maker is a firm or individual that stands ready to buy and sell a particular asset, providing liquidity to the market. They profit from the bid-ask spread (the difference between the price they’re willing to buy at and the price they’re willing to sell at). In the crypto space, market makers play a vital role in ensuring smooth trading and preventing large price swings due to lack of buyers or sellers. Why is a Bitcoin Whale Transferring to a Market Maker Important? When a Bitcoin whale sends funds to a market maker, it typically signals one of several possibilities: Potential Over-the-Counter (OTC) Sale: Whales often prefer OTC desks for large sales to avoid impacting exchange order books and causing significant price drops. Market makers frequently operate or facilitate these OTC deals. Liquidity Provision: The whale might be providing liquidity to the market maker, perhaps as part of a structured deal or a lending agreement. Rebalancing or Diversification: While less common for such a direct transfer to a market maker, the whale could be rebalancing their portfolio or preparing to diversify into other assets. Custodial Transfer: It could be a transfer to a new custodian service that utilizes market makers for their operations. Given the suspected prior sales of 330 BTC over the past week, the most common interpretation is that this Bitcoin whale is engaging in a strategic liquidation or rebalancing of a portion of its vast holdings. The involvement of entities like B2C2, Galaxy, and Coinbase further solidifies the notion of a professional, large-scale transaction. How Do We Track These Elusive Bitcoin Whales? Tracking the movements of a Bitcoin whale might sound like a task for deep-sea explorers, but in the world of crypto, it’s done through sophisticated blockchain analytics. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on the public ledger, making it possible to trace the flow of funds, albeit pseudonymously. Tools and Techniques for Monitoring Whales: Blockchain Explorers: These tools allow anyone to view transactions, wallet balances, and addresses. While addresses are pseudonymous, patterns of activity can be identified. On-Chain Analytics Platforms: Specialized platforms use advanced algorithms to cluster addresses, identify entities (like exchanges, market makers, or known whales), and track their activity over time. They provide insights into coin age, whale inflows/outflows, and exchange balances. Social Media and Crypto News Outlets: Analysts often share their findings on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and in crypto news, alerting the community to significant whale movements. By observing these movements, market participants gain valuable insights into potential supply shocks or shifts in market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data provides raw information; interpretation requires expertise and context. Navigating the Waters: What Are the Implications for Your Portfolio? The activity of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale can certainly create ripples, but what does it truly mean for the average investor? Potential Market Reactions: Short-Term Volatility: Large transfers, especially if followed by confirmed sales, can introduce selling pressure and lead to temporary price dips. Market Sentiment Shift: News of a major whale moving funds can sometimes trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among less experienced investors, leading to panic selling. Opportunity for Accumulation: Conversely, savvy investors might view temporary dips as buying opportunities, especially if they believe in Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals. Actionable Insights for Investors: While intriguing, whale movements shouldn’t be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Understand the context of the whale’s move. Is it a transfer to an exchange, an OTC desk, or just an internal wallet shuffle? Not all transfers lead to immediate sales. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s long-term value is driven by its adoption, network security, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors, not solely by individual whale actions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden market movements. Define Your Strategy: Have a clear investment strategy, whether it’s dollar-cost averaging, long-term holding, or active trading. Stick to your plan and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you are actively trading to protect your capital from significant downturns. Conclusion: The Enduring Mystery of the Deep The recent activity of this long-dormant Bitcoin whale serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements are fascinating and can indeed influence short-term price action and market sentiment, they are just one piece of a much larger puzzle. The true significance lies not just in the transfer itself, but in the broader context of market fundamentals, technological developments, and global adoption trends. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the transparency of the blockchain continues to offer unprecedented insights into the actions of its largest players, allowing us to observe, analyze, and better understand the intricate dance between supply, demand, and sentiment. For now, the mystery of this ancient Bitcoin whale continues to unfold, keeping us all on the edge of our seats. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a dormant Bitcoin whale? A dormant Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin and has not moved any of their holdings for an extended period, often several years or even over a decade. Their sudden activity is closely watched due to their potential market impact. Q2: Why is the movement of 180 BTC by this whale significant? This movement is significant because the whale has been dormant since 2010, meaning these coins haven’t moved in over 14 years. Such old coins moving to market maker-linked addresses often suggest a potential sale or reallocation, which can impact Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and market sentiment. Q3: What does it mean if Bitcoin is sent to a market maker address? Sending Bitcoin to a market maker address typically indicates that the owner intends to sell a large amount of Bitcoin without directly impacting public exchange order books. Market makers facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) trades, providing liquidity for large transactions while minimizing market disruption. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using blockchain explorers and specialized on-chain analytics platforms. These tools allow you to view large transactions, monitor significant wallet addresses, and identify patterns of activity, though interpreting the data requires some understanding of blockchain mechanics. Q5: Should I be worried about my Bitcoin holdings if a whale sells? While large whale sales can cause short-term price volatility, it’s important not to panic. Focus on Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals, your own investment strategy, and risk tolerance. Not every whale transfer results in an immediate sale, and the market often absorbs large transactions over time.

2025-07-31T16:38:07,"ETH Treasury entities now hold over $10 billion worth of ETH","The amount of Ether held by entities with Ethereum treasuries has now surpassed $10 billion. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve confirmed this, noting that 64 entities now hold 2.73 million ETH, worth $10.49 billion. While this accounts for only 2.27% of the total ETH supply, it highlights the impact that several public companies’ recent adoption of the ETH treasury has had on the total ETH reserve. The data shows that three publicly traded companies hold over 1.3 million ETH and represent the top three holders. At number one is Bitmine Immersion Tech, which now holds 625,000 ETH, followed by Sharplink Gaming with 438,200 ETH and The Ether Machine with 334,800 ETH. The size of ETH holdings by these three companies is even more impressive, given that they acquired most of the Ether in less than ninety days. Bitmine alone holds over $2 billion worth of ETH and has been on an accumulation spree in the past few weeks. The same applies to its closest competitor, Sharplink, which started buying ETH in June. Its last acquisition was the purchase of over 77,000 ETH on July 29, and it remains committed to buying more ETH. Interestingly, the Ethereum Foundation ranks fourth among the biggest ETH holders, with the organization having around 234,600 ETH. Less than two months ago, it was the leading ETH holder. Other publicly traded companies in the top ten include Bit Digital and BTCS Inc. However, other companies such as Centaurus Energy, ETHZilla Corporation, BTC Digital, and ETH Strategy are also on the list. Nevertheless, DeFi protocols and crypto-native organizations remain among the biggest ETH holders. Mantle Network recently disclosed that it holds over 101,000 ETH, while Gnosis DAO, Pulsechain Sac, Golem Foundation, Lido DAO, and Frax Finance also have ETH treasuries. Even government entities are among the 64 holders of ETH, with the US government having 60,000 ETH, Michigan State Government with 4,000 ETH, and the Royal Government of Bhutan with 495 ETH. Companies looking to buy more ETH Meanwhile, the amount of ETH held as reserve assets by various entities will likely keep increasing, especially as several public companies plan to continue buying more ETH. Standard Chartered’s report notes that public companies bought 1% of the ETH supply in June and will likely buy up to 10% of the supply over time. Interestingly, Bitmine Ceo Tom Lee also confirmed this, stating that the company plans to buy and stake up to 5% of the ETH supply, which would amount to around 6 million ETH. He disclosed that the company is actively working on strategies to achieve this. However, the firm also recently approved plans to buy back $1 billion of its shares from the open market and negotiate transactions. This move occurs when its stock value is below net asset value (NAV) and appears calculated to further boost share value before returning to ETH accumulation mode. Not only is Bitmine taking a more measured approach to its accumulation, with Sharplink chairman Joe Lubin also stating that the company wants to buy more ETH, but it will be cautious to keep leverage in check. Sharplink is already considering issuing convertible notes similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to get the capital needed to increase its ETH holdings. ETH steadies around $3,700 as journey to $4,000 stalls Despite the accumulation frenzy, ETH has seen its price movement stall in the past few days. According to CoinMarketCap data, the token traded as high as $3,877 earlier today has now dropped to $3,774, representing a slight decline. With this decline, investors expecting ETH to climb above $4,000 on the anniversary of its 10 years of existence have had their hopes dashed as the momentum that pushed it to gain more than 100% in three months appears to have subsided. Nevertheless, on-chain data shows that Ethereum activity is still booming with over 680,000 active wallets on Wednesday, making it its second busiest day. ETH Mean value to realized value (MVRV) has also increased 38% in the past year and 15% in the past month. ETH gains are not due to capital rotation from Bitcoin (Source: CryptoQuant) Interestingly, ETH gains over the past month have happened independent of Bitcoin. According to crypto analyst Carmelo Aleman, ETH gains have not been due to any major capital rotation from Bitcoin but new capital flowing into Ethereum.

2025-07-31T16:35:10,"Simplicity Smart Contracts: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Future on Liquid Network","BitcoinWorld Simplicity Smart Contracts: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Future on Liquid Network The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and at its core, innovation often revolves around expanding the capabilities of foundational blockchains. For years, the Bitcoin network, renowned for its security and decentralization, has been seen primarily as a store of value. However, a significant shift is underway, promising to unlock a new era of functionality. The recent deployment of Simplicity smart contracts on the Bitcoin layer-2 Liquid Network by blockchain technology company Blockstream marks a pivotal moment. This development, as noted by Unfolded on X, isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a profound turning point for the full-scale adoption of advanced smart contract functionality within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. But what exactly does this mean for Bitcoin’s future, and how will Simplicity smart contracts reshape the landscape? What Are Simplicity Smart Contracts and Why Do They Matter? To truly appreciate the significance of this launch, we must first understand what Simplicity smart contracts are. Unlike the more expressive, Turing-complete languages found on platforms like Ethereum (Solidity), Simplicity is a low-level, high-assurance programming language specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. Developed by Russell O’Connor at Blockstream, its primary goal is to create more secure, auditable, and formally verifiable smart contracts. Enhanced Security: Simplicity aims to minimize the attack surface inherent in complex smart contracts. Its design reduces the potential for bugs and exploits that have plagued other platforms. Formal Verification: One of Simplicity’s standout features is its amenability to formal verification. This means that the behavior of a contract can be mathematically proven to be correct, significantly increasing trust and reliability. Predictable Resource Usage: Simplicity contracts have predictable execution costs and resource consumption, which is crucial for a network like Bitcoin where efficiency is paramount. Bitcoin-Centric Design: While not directly on the main Bitcoin chain, Simplicity is built with Bitcoin’s principles in mind, focusing on security, determinism, and resistance to unexpected behavior. In essence, Simplicity isn’t about making Bitcoin do everything Ethereum can do; it’s about enabling a specific, secure, and robust set of smart contract capabilities that align with Bitcoin’s ethos. This focus on security and predictability makes Simplicity smart contracts a compelling solution for high-value applications where trust is non-negotiable. The Liquid Network: The Ideal Home for Simplicity Smart Contracts? The choice of the Liquid Network as the deployment ground for Simplicity smart contracts is no coincidence. Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain, a layer-2 solution that operates parallel to the main Bitcoin blockchain. It’s designed to facilitate faster, more confidential, and more scalable transactions for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Here’s why Liquid is an excellent fit for Simplicity: Pegged Bitcoin (L-BTC): Liquid uses a 1:1 peg to Bitcoin, meaning L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin) is backed by actual BTC held in a federated multisig setup. This allows users to move BTC onto Liquid, utilize its features, and then move it back to the main chain. Speed and Confidentiality: Liquid offers block times of one minute and confidential transactions, which obscure the amounts and asset types involved in transactions, enhancing privacy for institutional users. Federated Model: Governed by a federation of reputable cryptocurrency companies and exchanges, Liquid provides a robust and secure environment for specialized financial applications. Existing Infrastructure: Liquid already supports the issuance of various digital assets (e.g., stablecoins, security tokens) and has a growing ecosystem of exchanges and wallets. Integrating Simplicity here allows for the creation of more complex, programmable assets and financial instruments on top of this established infrastructure. The synergy between Simplicity’s secure, verifiable smart contracts and Liquid’s high-speed, confidential, and asset-issuing capabilities creates a powerful combination. It extends Bitcoin’s reach into sophisticated financial applications without burdening the main chain, positioning Liquid as a crucial hub for advanced Bitcoin-centric innovation through Simplicity smart contracts . Revolutionizing Bitcoin: What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? The deployment of Simplicity smart contracts on Liquid represents a significant step towards a more versatile Bitcoin ecosystem. While Bitcoin’s main chain remains focused on its core function as a robust store of value, Liquid, powered by Simplicity, can now become a fertile ground for a new generation of financial services and applications that directly leverage Bitcoin’s security. Key Implications: This development has several profound implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the broader crypto world: Advanced Financial Instruments: Simplicity enables the creation of more complex financial contracts, such as sophisticated escrow services, advanced multi-signature schemes, atomic swaps, and even decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with enhanced security guarantees. Imagine a future where a significant portion of Bitcoin-backed DeFi can operate with higher assurances than currently possible on other chains. Enhanced Digital Asset Capabilities: While Liquid already supports token issuance, Simplicity allows these tokens to become “smarter.” This means assets issued on Liquid can have built-in rules for their transfer, redemption, or interaction with other contracts, opening doors for regulated security tokens, stablecoins with advanced features, or even tokenized real-world assets. Developer Accessibility and Innovation: As Simplicity gains traction, it will attract a new wave of developers interested in building secure, Bitcoin-aligned applications. While it has a steeper learning curve than some other languages, its benefits for security-critical applications are immense, fostering innovation in areas where formal verification is paramount. Scaling Bitcoin’s Utility: By offloading complex computations and transactions to a layer-2 solution like Liquid, Bitcoin’s core blockchain remains lean and focused. This strategy is crucial for scaling Bitcoin’s utility without compromising its fundamental security and decentralization principles. It allows Bitcoin to participate in the smart contract revolution in a way that respects its original design. However, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. The adoption curve for a new programming language can be steep, and attracting a critical mass of developers and users will take time. Furthermore, while Liquid offers enhanced privacy and speed, it is a federated sidechain, which means it has a different trust model than the main Bitcoin chain. Educating users about these nuances will be vital for widespread adoption of applications built with Simplicity smart contracts .

2025-07-31T16:30:11,"Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit-Taking Waves: What Every Investor Needs to Know","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit-Taking Waves: What Every Investor Needs to Know Have you ever wondered about the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market, particularly when it comes to the world’s leading digital asset? The journey of Bitcoin is often characterized by exhilarating highs and sometimes dramatic corrections. Lately, the spotlight has been on a significant phenomenon: Bitcoin profit-taking . This isn’t just a casual sale; it’s a strategic move by major players that can send ripples across the entire market. Understanding these cycles is absolutely crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital finance. Understanding Bitcoin Profit-Taking: Why Does It Happen? At its core, Bitcoin profit-taking refers to the act of investors selling their Bitcoin holdings after a period of price appreciation to ‘realize’ or lock in their gains. It’s a natural part of any financial market, but in the volatile crypto space, these events can be particularly pronounced. When Bitcoin’s price surges, early investors, large holders (often called ‘whales’), and even retail traders see an opportunity to cash out some of their holdings. This behavior is driven by several factors: Risk Management: Investors might sell a portion of their holdings to reduce their overall exposure and secure profits, especially after significant rallies. Market Psychology: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can drive prices up, but eventually, the fear of losing gains can trigger selling. Strategic Rebalancing: Large institutions and sophisticated investors often rebalance their portfolios to maintain a desired asset allocation. Meeting Financial Goals: For many, investing in Bitcoin is a long-term strategy, but short-term profit-taking can help meet immediate financial needs or fund other investments. These profit-taking events are not necessarily a sign of market weakness, but rather a normal, cyclical behavior that indicates a maturing market where participants are actively managing their positions. The Anatomy of Bitcoin’s Recent Profit-Taking Waves: A Closer Look According to recent insights from CryptoQuant on X, Bitcoin has just experienced its third major profit-taking wave of this bull cycle. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a recurring pattern that savvy investors observe closely. The data reveals a significant surge in realized profits, with an estimated $6–8 billion being taken off the table in late July alone. This staggering figure highlights the scale of capital movement within the Bitcoin ecosystem. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the previous instances of substantial Bitcoin profit-taking during this cycle: December 2023: The first notable wave occurred as Bitcoin began its ascent from lower price levels, signaling early investors securing gains. March 2024: A second, more pronounced wave followed Bitcoin’s push towards new all-time highs, as many long-term holders finally saw substantial returns. Late July 2024: The latest wave, characterized by the $6-8 billion surge, is particularly interesting because it was reportedly led by ‘new whales’—investors who acquired significant amounts of Bitcoin more recently and are now capitalizing on the rally, especially as prices moved above the $120,000 mark. These repeated instances of large-scale profit-taking underscore a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s market dynamics: while the asset aims for long-term growth, there are significant points where substantial capital is moved, influencing short-to-medium term price action. Are These Bitcoin Profit-Taking Waves a Cause for Concern? When investors see large amounts of Bitcoin being sold, a common question arises: is this a red flag? The answer is nuanced. While significant selling pressure can lead to price corrections, Bitcoin profit-taking waves are often a healthy sign of market maturity and liquidity. Here’s why they might not be as alarming as they seem: Liquidity and Market Depth: The ability for billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to be sold and absorbed by the market demonstrates its growing liquidity and depth. This is a positive indicator for institutional adoption and overall market robustness. Healthy Correction: After substantial rallies, corrections are natural and necessary. They help cool down overheated markets, shake out speculative positions, and allow for a healthier consolidation before the next leg up. Whale Behavior Analysis: The fact that ‘new whales’ are leading the recent selling suggests a shift in market participants. These might be newer, more active traders rather than long-term holders, whose selling behavior could be different from those who have held Bitcoin for many years. Understanding who is selling and why provides valuable context. Reinvestment Potential: Often, profits taken from one asset are reinvested into other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or even back into Bitcoin at a lower price, contributing to overall market activity. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges. Sustained profit-taking without sufficient buying pressure can lead to deeper corrections, testing the resolve of investors. Monitoring key on-chain metrics and market sentiment becomes vital during such periods. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors Understanding Bitcoin profit-taking cycles isn’t just academic; it offers actionable insights for investors looking to optimize their strategies. How can you use this information to your advantage? Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analytics firms like CryptoQuant. Their data can provide early warnings or confirmations of significant market movements. Don’t Panic Sell: Unless your personal financial situation dictates otherwise, resist the urge to panic sell during profit-taking events. These are often temporary market corrections. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re a long-term investor, using DCA to buy Bitcoin regularly, regardless of price fluctuations, can help mitigate the impact of volatility and average down your purchase price during dips caused by profit-taking. Develop a Personal Strategy: Define your investment goals, risk tolerance, and exit strategy. Knowing when you plan to take profits (or cut losses) can prevent emotional decisions. Look for Accumulation Zones: Periods of profit-taking often present opportunities for new investors or those looking to increase their holdings to buy Bitcoin at more attractive prices. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is dominant, a diversified portfolio across different crypto assets can help spread risk and potentially capture gains from other sectors if Bitcoin experiences a deeper correction. Ultimately, a disciplined approach, combined with a deep understanding of market cycles, will serve you best in the volatile yet rewarding world of Bitcoin. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin? The recent Bitcoin profit-taking waves, while significant, are part of Bitcoin’s journey as it matures into a global macro asset. Looking ahead, several factors will continue to influence Bitcoin’s trajectory: Institutional Adoption: The increasing interest from traditional financial institutions, evidenced by Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries holding BTC, will likely provide long-term support and reduce volatility over time. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events (halvings) historically precede bull runs. The next halving is anticipated to continue this trend, albeit with potentially different dynamics due to increased market maturity. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events will continue to play a role in how investors perceive Bitcoin as a store of value or a speculative asset. Technological Developments: Ongoing advancements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster transactions or broader layer-2 solutions, could enhance its utility and drive further adoption. While profit-taking waves are an inherent part of Bitcoin’s market cycle, they don’t necessarily signal an end to its growth story. Instead, they represent moments of market rebalancing, preparing the ground for future movements. The resilience Bitcoin has shown through numerous such cycles speaks volumes about its enduring appeal and potential. In conclusion, the recent surge in Bitcoin profit-taking , reaching $6–8 billion in late July, marks a significant third wave in this bull cycle, driven notably by ‘new whales.’ This phenomenon, mirroring spikes in March and December 2024, is a natural and often healthy part of market dynamics. While it can lead to short-term price volatility, it also demonstrates market liquidity and allows for necessary corrections. For investors, understanding these cycles is key to making informed decisions, whether through dollar-cost averaging, strategic rebalancing, or simply maintaining a long-term perspective. As Bitcoin continues its journey, these profit-taking moments serve as vital indicators, shaping its path towards future growth and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Bitcoin profit-taking? A1: Bitcoin profit-taking is when investors sell their Bitcoin holdings after a price increase to lock in their gains. It’s a common practice in financial markets to secure profits and manage risk. Q2: How often do major Bitcoin profit-taking waves occur?

Tether, Inc. published its H1 attestation, marking some of its growth milestones in 2025. In total, Tether injected $20B in stablecoin liquidity, with new USDT minting on both Ethereum and TRON. Tether reported a total of $162,574,933,798 in assets, above the obligations based on the issued stablecoins. Tether just released its quarterly attestation for Q2 2025. Highlights as of 30th June 2025: * 157.1B total issued USDt, end of Q2 2025. * 162.5B total assets/reserves, end of Q2 2025. * 5.47B excess reserves, on top of the 100% reserves in liquid assets that back all issued… https://t.co/bejhVFkMYt pic.twitter.com/XYVmueWZ0G — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) July 31, 2025 Tether also published its attestation for Q2, prepared by its usual partner, the accounting firm BDO. Q2 was an extremely active period for Tether and its global expansion. Out of the $20B in liquidity, $13.4B was injected in Q2 alone. The acceleration of USDT printing followed the overall trend of mass awareness about stablecoins, as well as sufficient trust in Tether as a resilient issuer. In H1, the company had not yet retired its USDT on legacy chains, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier in July. The retirement of legacy USDT will only slightly lower the total supply. In 2025, the supply of TRON expanded more rapidly, to over 89B tokens. Most of the Tether mints injected multiple tranches of 1B tokens. USDT on Ethereum is still at 79B, growing at a slower pace. Within the crypto space, USDT is most widely used for centralized exchanges, with DeFi being the second largest use case. Tether grew its exposure to US treasuries To support its new USDT emissions, Tether had to grow its exposure to US treasuries. As of June 30, total exposure to US treasuries exceeded $127B, with $8B added in Q2. Tether expanded its global presence while still working toward becoming a MiCA-compliant asset in the EU. The token retained its primacy, with speedier expansion compared to its main rival, Circle’s USDC. Tether holds $105.5B in direct holdings, with $21.3B owned indirectly. Tether’s reserves showed a mix of private financial innovation and public monetary goals. Tether was emboldened to grow the USDT supply, as US lawmakers offered a favorable framework to make the dollar the key metric for crypto trading. The application of the US GENIUS Act, regulating stablecoins, has turned dollar-denominated tokens into the leading source of liquidity. Tether posted robust profits in Q2 Tether posted $4.9B in net profits for the second quarter, bringing the total for H1 to $5.7B. The company achieved $3.1B in recurrent profits, excluding additional operations from gold and Bitcoin, which added another $2.6B. Tether reinvests its profits in a growing portfolio of over 120 large and small companies. In H1, 2025, Tether gained unprecedented exposure to other businesses as a way of diversifying its activity. Tether directed the most capital into direct investment efforts compared to its previous history, marking a milestone in expanding the crypto infrastructure. Some of the large-scale initiatives include the Bitcoin treasury company XXI Capital and the investment in Rumble and Rumble Wallet. Tether has deployed an estimated $4B of its own retained earnings into the US-based crypto ecosystem. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-07-31T16:22:24,"Tether Reports $4.9B Net Profit in Q2, Invested $4B in U.S. Initiatives","Tether International Ltd., the holding company behind the largest stablecoin, USDT, posted second-quarter net profit of $4.9 billion . The company held over $162.5 billion in reserves against $157.1 billion in liabilities, the USDT tokens issued, according to the latest attestation by accounting firm BDO. That puts excess reserves at $5.4 billion. Exposure to U.S. Treasuries, including direct holdings and instruments like money market funds and overnight reverse repurchase agreements, rose past $127 billion as it issued more than $13 billion of USDT in the quarter. The company said it booked year-to-date recurrent profits of $3.1 billion, and another $2.6 billion in mark-to-market contributions of gold and bitcoin (BTC) price appreciation. The firm held roughly $8.9 billion in BTC in the reserves, translating to over 83,200 tokens as of June 30, the attestation shows. Tether has begun channeling earnings into investments spanning artificial intelligence, renewable energy and digital communications, with U.S.-based initiatives receiving about $4 billion to date, the firm said. That figure includes XXI Capital , bitcoin treasury firm that is poised to go public by merging with a Cantor Fitzgerald-backed shell company (CEP), investment in video sharing platform Rumble and developing the firm's crypto wallet offering. The report comes as stablecoins are rapidly being integrated into the broader financial plumbing, with the U.S. signing the GENIUS Act into law to regulate the sector. Earlier this month, CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an interview with CoinDesk that his company will comply with the new laws and issue an on-shore version of its stablecoin.

2025-07-31T16:19:32,"Adam Beck's Blockstream Unveils Bitcoin-Powered, Liquid Network-Based Smart Contracts","Bitcoin development firm Blockstream has unveiled ""Simplicity,"" a programming language for smart contracts built on the layer-2 network Liquid. Co-founded by cryptographer and early Bitcoin contributor Dr. Adam Back, Blockstream has introduced Simplicity with the aim of solving the limitations of Bitcoin as a venue for smart contracts. ""Simplicity gives Bitcoin expressive smart contracting power, but without the security problems associated with VM-based chains,"" said Back in an emailed announcement on Thursday. ""It’s built from the ground up to be formally specified, secure, and efficient.” The push for Bitcoin-native programmability has gained momentum in recent years, especially since the introduction of BitVM in 2023 , a framework that explored how complex computations could be verified on Bitcoin without altering the base protocol. Simplicity's origins in fact predate BitVM, having been conceptualized by Blockstream research Dr. Russell O'Connor in 2012. It is designed to enable smart contracts eschewing some of the features like unbounded loops that can lead to vulnerabilities and exploits on networks like Ethereum. Instead, Simplicity uses Bitcoin's UTXO model, whereby tokens function like digital cash and users spend specific coins, as opposed to account balances being updated. Simplicity is now live on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin layer-2 with over $3 billion in total value locked (TVL), allowing developers to build many of the applications commonplace on smart contract-enabled blockchains, such as programmable vaults, decentralized exchanges, custody services and governance protocols, using Bitcoin as the settlement layer.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/07/31/adam-beck-s-blockstream-unveils-bitcoin-powered-liquid-network-based-smart-contracts,"BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|RESEARCH","Tech|Blockstream|Adam Back|Bitcoin|smart contracts|Liquid Network|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-31T16:15:20,"These 3 Public Companies Now Own Nearly 4% of All Bitcoin and Why That’s Risky","DATCOs, a.k.a Digital Asset Treasury Companies, now collectively hold over $100 billion in digital assets. The bulk of these holdings is dominated by publicly listed firms, with Michael Saylor-led Strategy leading the pack, followed by Japan’s Metaplanet and US-based SharpLink Gaming. Together, treasury companies have amassed 791,662 BTC and 1,313,318 ETH, representing roughly 3.98% of Bitcoin’s and 1.09% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. DATCO Holdings Top $100B According to the latest report published by Galaxy Digital, Strategy alone holds BTC currently valued at $71.8 billion, with more than $28 billion in unrealized profits. It appears that early entry and aggressive accumulation strategies have paid off. Other DATCOs, while smaller in size, also benefit from low cost bases and significant upside potential. A growing number of entrants are diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. These entities are expanding their holdings to include at least ten other digital assets, such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Ethereum-focused treasury companies are going further by leveraging staking and DeFi strategies to generate non-dilutive returns, a feature not available to BTC-only firms. While the US remains the dominant hub for these companies, international players are increasingly entering the market, owing to “regional capital market dynamics.” Unlike ETFs, DATCOs have the ability to raise and deploy capital more flexibly, which may attract narrative-driven inflows from investors. In the future, DATCOs are expected to play an even bigger role in the crypto industry. But this growth isn’t without risks. Stimulant or Depressant? One major issue is the “reflexive” relationship developing between the stock prices of DATCOs and the price of Bitcoin. When investors put money into DATCOs, these companies can raise capital more easily and use it to buy more BTC, thereby creating a feedback loop. This loop acts like a stimulant during bull markets, which pushes prices higher. But if the broader macro environment shifts to a risk-off setting, that stimulant could become a “depressant,” dragging prices down. A growing concern is that Bitcoin’s price is starting to follow risk-on behavior in the stock market more closely. Galaxy believes that “perhaps this was inevitable.” DATCOs have helped make Bitcoin more accessible to institutional investors, but in doing so, they may be creating a system where Bitcoin depends too much on equity markets – something that goes against the very ethos of being a non-correlated asset.

2025-07-31T16:00:07,"Spot Solana ETF Race: 21Shares Updates Application After US SEC Requests Amendments","The race for a Spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is drawing significant attention and efforts in the crypto sector, with several asset management companies submitting applications for the fund. As the deadline of approval draws near for the fund, 21Shares has taken a bold step to improve its spot SOL ETFs. 21Shares Amends Spot Solana ETF Filing In a significant development for the Solana ecosystem and broader crypto market, 21Shares has submitted an updated version of its Spot Solana ETF application. Such a move is a sign of an unwavering desire to introduce SOL-based investment products into traditional markets. SolanaFloor, a platform for SOL news, reported the key move in a recent post on the social media platform X, reflecting growing momentum among asset managers to create crypto ETFs that extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the company looks to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for clearance, the updated filing attempts to bolster the proposal and address regulatory concerns about the fund. Specifically, the updated version responds to the US SEC comments on key areas of the fund, such as in-kind redemptions. 21Shares’ Core Solana ETF (the Trust) is sponsored by 21Shares US LLC, previously known as Amun Holdings Limited. Furthermore, it is an exchange-traded fund that trades on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange) and issues common shares of beneficial interest (the Shares). In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold SOL and use the Pricing Benchmark to determine the daily value of its shares. However, it is important to note that an investment in the Trust is neither a direct investment in SOL nor does it give investors direct exposure to the altcoin. Instead, it offers investors the chance to enter the SOL market indirectly through a conventional brokerage account, avoiding the dangers and any obstacles of the spot market . According to the application, “all of the Trust’s SOL will be held by the SOL Custodian,” which is the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. The Custodian carries protection from private insurance companies rather than being insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). More Companies Are Joining The Fray Since the move for a Spot Solana ETF, several companies have submitted applications for the funds. The latest application for a spot SOL ETF submitted to the US SEC came from the Cboe BZX Exchange. A Few days ago, Cboe BZX filed to list the Invesco Galaxy SOL ETF on the exchange. Cboe’s ETF, which is a commodity-based trust under BZX Rule 14.11, aims to provide regulated access to SOL with integrated staking incentives. This move comes weeks following the launch of the first Solana Staking ETF in the United States. If authorized by the Commission, the Invesco Galaxy SOL ETF would rank among the first Solana spot ETFs offered in the US. When approved, both cash and in-kind creations and redemptions will be permitted by the fund.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-solana-etf-race/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK","Solana|21Shares US LLC|21Shares’ Core Solana ETF|Altcoin|Amun Holdings Limited|bitcoin|Cboe BZX Exchange|Coinbase Custody Trust Company|ETF|Ethereum|FDIC|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF|SOL|SOL Custodian|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana ecosystem|Solana news|Solana price|Solana Staking ETF|SolanaFloor|solusd|SOLUSDT|Spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission",cryptocompare
