2025-07-30T23:00:55,"$141,000 Could Be Next Key Bitcoin Resistance If Price Breaks Higher, Report Says","A new Glassnode report has revealed that $141,000 could end up being the next major resistance for Bitcoin, should its price break convincingly higher. Bitcoin Is Currently Trading Between These Two STH Pricing Bands In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis and some pricing bands derived from it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buying Spree Ends On Coinbase: Temporary Pause Or Trend Shift? This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor part of the STH cohort. Formally, STHs are defined as investors who have been holding their coins for less than 155 days. This group is made up of the new entrants in the network and high-frequency traders. In other words, it represents the low-conviction side of the market. A cohort called the long-term holder (LTH) group (holding time greater than 155 days) corresponds to BTC‚Äôs HODLers. When the price of the cryptocurrency is trading above the STH Cost Basis, it means the STH cohort as a whole is in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, the asset‚Äôs value being under the metric suggests the dominance of loss among the cohort. Historically, the STH Cost Basis has served as an important boundary between local bullish and bearish trends. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows which side of it the asset is trading right now. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price broke through the STH Cost Basis earlier in the year and has since gained a notable amount of distance over it. At the current metric value of $105,400 and the latest BTC price, the STHs are sitting on a net gain of 11.5%. ‚ÄúTo add statistical context, we can apply standard deviation bands around the STH cost basis,‚Äù explains the report. ‚ÄúThese dynamic price zones help identify areas of trend exhaustion or breakout potential.‚Äù From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that BTC has found resistance at the +1 standard deviation (SD) band multiple times this cycle, with two rejections coming in the bullish push of the last few months alone.

At present, this level lies at $125,100. ‚ÄúFrom a broader perspective, this suggests that Bitcoin may remain range-bound between $105K and $125K until a decisive breakout occurs,‚Äù notes Glassnode. What will happen once a breakout does occur? According to the analytics firm, the +2 SD level situated at $141,600 could become the next major area of resistance instead.¬†At this level, STH profits would have ballooned significantly, raising the chances of¬†mass selling occurring with the motive of profit-taking. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to consolidate inside its range recently as its price is still trading around $117,600.

2025-07-30T23:00:47,"Top Trader Says XRP Will Create Many New Millionaires In 4 Weeks","Over the past month, XRP has shown a notable surge in both price and sentiment, reigniting optimism among traders and analysts who have closely tracked its price movements. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular analyst on X, recently weighed in on the asset‚Äôs performance, predicting that the asset will create many new millionaires in four weeks. He shared an Altcoin Season Index chart, which measures whether market momentum favors Bitcoin or the broader altcoin market. The current reading shows the index rising sharply from the lower end of the spectrum, breaking out of Bitcoin‚Äôs season, and heading toward the midpoint. #XRP will create so many new millionaires in the next 4 weeks! pic.twitter.com/1Aqw94XFOb ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 29, 2025 Altcoin Season in Sight Historically, such transitions have preceded strong capital inflows into altcoins, with XRP playing a recurring role during these shifts. The first altcoin season highlighted on the chart occurred in mid-2023, where a pivotal ruling in the XRP lawsuit sent the digital asset to $0.93, its highest level since 2021 at that time. The next altcoin season came in early 2024, and XRP joined the market, rising to $0.74 despite pressure from the lawsuit. The final altcoin season came in late 2024 and lasted into early 2025. During this period, XRP experienced explosive growth, climbing from $0.55 in November 2024 to $3.39 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The current breakout sits just below the midpoint of the index, near the 47 mark, indicating that the broader market may be in the early stages of rotating back into altcoins. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, has also confirmed the market‚Äôs shift toward another altcoin season . XRP has historically performed well when the market shifts away from Bitcoin-centric momentum and Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance weakens . Steph expects this transition to complete within the next four weeks, with XRP, the second-largest altcoin, leading the market for this cycle. XRP‚Äôs July Rally Adds Fuel This narrative is reinforced by XRP‚Äôs price performance over the past month. The token opened the month at $2.23 and climbed to an all-time high of $3.65 in under 3 weeks. The asset is currently trading at $3.11, holding firmly above the $3 support level. This rally coincided with the sharp upward turn in the Altcoin Season Index. The timing supports the idea that XRP‚Äôs gains are contributing to the shift toward altcoin season, and if Steph is right, we could see the asset‚Äôs momentum accelerate in the coming weeks.
