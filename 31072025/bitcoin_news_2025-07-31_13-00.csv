2025-07-31T10:53:18,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 31, 2025","The crypto market is up today, seeing a minor uptick. Three-quarters of the top 100 coins per market have turned green over the past 24 hours. That said, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 3.6% to $3.96 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $154 billion. TLDR: Crypto market turned mildly green over the past day; Nine out of the top 10 coins are up; BTC and ETH saw moderate increases, trading at $118,386 and $3,860, respectively; A decisive breakout above the $105,000-$125,000 range could lead toward $141,000; US ETH spot ETFs hit the 19th day of inflows, one day short of a record; US BTC spot ETFs recorded minor positive flows of $47 million; As expected, there will be no rate cuts in the US; Should Jerome Powell be fired or begin rate cuts too early, BTC will “rally a lot”; ’Bitcoin long-term holders still command 53% of supply despite recent distribution’. Crypto Winners & Losers Only one of the top 10 coins per market capitalization has decreased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is largely unchanged, having increased by 0.4% in a day, now trading at $118,386. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) increased the most in this category: 1.5%, now changing hands at $3,860. While XRP appreciated 0.9% to $3.15, the large majority of these coins are up by less than 0.5% at the time of writing. On the other hand, Tron (TRX) is the only coin in the category that decreased today: 3% to $0.327. As for the top 100 coins, 75 coins are up today. Ethena (ENA) saw the only double-digit rise. It’s up 12.7% to the price of $0.6464. It’s followed by Story (IP) , with a 9.1% rise to $6.24. Other coins in this category are up 4.9% and less. On the opposite side, Tron fell the most in this category as well, followed by XDC Network (XDC) , with a 2.8% drop to $0.09755. Other red coins are down 1.7% and less per coin. The markets across the board, crypto included, have reacted to comments from the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that largely squashed any hopes for a rate cut in the coming month. Powell said that the Fed first needs to see more data that would allow it to estimate the tariffs’ effect on inflation. That said, even though a rate cut would be positive for crypto, suggesting that a lack of news suggesting a cut would dampen the market’s performance, the crypto market is proving its resiliency yet again with the day’s moderate uptick. Notably, there are positive financial reports coming from major companies. Robinhood’s crypto revenue jumped 98% to $160 million . For Q2 2025, it reported revenue of $989 million, a 45% year-on-year increase. Robinhood Markets has just released financial results for the second quarter of 2025.

A decisive breakout above this range could “shift market dynamics” and make way for a move toward $141,000. The latter is an area where “profit-taking could sharply intensify” and which is likely to see increased sell-side pressure due to the high unrealized profit expected there. On the other hand, there is a light volume zone between $110,000 and $115,000. This is “a critical area to monitor should a market pullback occur.” Also, additional metrics show “latent sell-side pressure,” the researchers noted. #Bitcoin 's Unrealized Profit as a percentage of Market Cap broke above the +2σ band, a level historically tied to euphoric phases. The setup mirrors previous ATH environments, reinforcing latent sell-side pressure. pic.twitter.com/3DyZ8q1vlf — glassnode (@glassnode) July 30, 2025 Meanwhile, many industry insiders commented on the US Fed news. Tom Bruni, VP of Community at Stocktwits , described the FOMC meeting as “uneventful with rates staying unchanged.” Most expect the September meeting to be the first cut. That said, Powell’s commentary is “the wildcard, as the Fed’s updated economic projections in June already told the story of slowing growth and sticky inflation,” Bruni says. “However, after a record run from the April lows, the stock market and other risk assets have stalled as the market’s focus shifts to earnings season.” “The pause in momentum suggests that investors/traders are looking for reasons to sell in this environment, so any unexpected comments or Q&As from Powell could trigger some weakness,” Bruni writes. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata , added that should Powell be fired or begin to cut rates too early, hard assets, especially BTC especially, could “rally a lot while inflation and bonds would lose a lot of value.” You may also like: Bitcoin Liquidity Was Tested, But Investor Supermajority Stays in Profit The crypto market is up today, seeing a minor uptick.

Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC trades at $118,386. 24 hours ago from the time of writing, it traded at $117,962. It traded sideways for several hours, then briefly dipped to $116,079 from the daily peak of $118,644. Over the past few hours, it continued trading sideways, trying to break back into the $119,000 level. This would signal further upside potential and a possible increase above $120,300. While there is a possibility for the coin to drop to the $114,530-$116,500 range, for now it’s attempting to appreciate further. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Despite the latest pullback, ETH continues rising and is working towards hitting $4,000. If this upwards moment continues, the price is likely to move back above $3,900 in a matter of days. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has dropped slightly over the past day. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 62 today compared to 63 yesterday. While still in the greed territory, the sentiment may enter the neutral zone. While there is notable optimism among the investors, there is also an increase in caution. With the ongoing regulatory and economic development, investors are awaiting further signals.

Both the crypto and the stock market saw mixed performances. The S&P 500 was down by 0.12%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.16%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.38%. The markets largely reacted to the US Federal Reserve’s indication that there will be no rate cuts in the coming month. Is this rally sustainable? This is a very moderate rise, and the market may go either way in the short term, depending on the additional incoming regulatory and economic signals.

2025-07-31T10:46:54,"BTCC Expands Spot Market With 80+ New Listings, Driving 35% Surge in Trading Volume","Cryptocurrency exchange BTCC recorded a 35% increase in average daily spot trading volume in July, following a significant expansion of its asset offerings. The exchange added more than 80 new spot trading pairs during the month, pushing its total number of spot pairs beyond 300. Its futures market now includes over 380 pairs. The boost in activity brought BTCC’s daily spot trading volume to over $4.5 million in the first three weeks of July. According to the exchange, the uptick was largely driven by heightened interest in newly listed tokens such as SPX6900 (SPX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Movement (MOVE), Magic Eden (ME), Useless Coin (USELESS), Vine Coin (VINE), and Zora (ZORA). These additions were selected based on emerging trends and trading momentum in the broader market. “The spot market is incredibly dynamic, and we're making it a key priority in the coming months to drive our continued growth,” said Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC. “We've seen tremendous momentum as crypto markets recover, which is why we've been rapidly expanding our spot listings since Q2 this year.” BTCC’s spot market has traditionally been anchored by high-volume tokens such as BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and MANTA. On the futures side, XRP, ETH, BTC, SOL, DOGE, and PENGU continue to dominate trading activity. To support the rollout of new listings, the platform also introduced Round 6 of its Hot Coins Trading Week campaign. The initiative highlights trending assets like SPK, PENGU, and PUMP, and offers trading rewards aimed at increasing user engagement across both new and existing user bases. The latest wave of listings reflects BTCC’s strategy to adapt quickly to market demand and expand its catalog with a mix of established cryptocurrencies, DeFi tokens, and lesser-known altcoins. As competition intensifies across exchanges, BTCC appears to be doubling down on breadth and responsiveness to attract active traders.

2025-07-31T10:32:09,"Which Altcoins, Other Than Bitcoin (BTC), Are Risks for Quantum Computers? Which Altcoins Are Safer? Here's the Latest Research!","As quantum computing becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives, it is reportedly a significant threat to Bitcoin (BTC). It is being argued that quantum computing could one day undermine the cryptographic foundations that secure trillions of dollars in crypto assets. According to Decrypt, Mysten Labs has conducted new research on quantum computing and cryptocurrencies, saying that some blockchains are more unprepared and vulnerable than others. Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui blockchain, said that their new blockchain is better prepared to face quantum threats. Mysten Labs said that new research shows that blockchains that use the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) are in a better position to deal with future quantum threats. At this point, new networks such as Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL) and Near (NEAR) are more reliable against the quantum threat, while older blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are in a more vulnerable position. This is because older blockchains like BTC and ETH use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which faces greater technical and operational hurdles in transitioning to quantum-resistant security. Mysten Labs noted that chains using EdDSA, such as Solana and Sui, are easier to upgrade for quantum resistance. Kostas Chalkias, co-founder of Mysten Labs, stated that governments are well aware of the risks posed by quantum computing, as Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategies have increased recently, saying: Governments around the world have issued mandates phasing out classic algorithms like ECDSA and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) by 2030 or 2035. It also means that if your blockchain supports sovereign assets, national cryptocurrency treasuries, ETFs, or CBDCs, and if your community values long-term reliability and mass adoption, you will soon need to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards.” Finally, Chalkias added that Bitcoin and Etheruem will also eventually need to upgrade their algorithms to transaction-secure quantum-resistant algorithms. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-31T10:25:31,"Bitfarms Ltd.: Optimistic With The Buyback Plan And US Exposure Into 2026","Summary I rate Bitfarms as a hold, highlighting its upcoming share buyback and strategic US expansion as key growth drivers. Despite 32.8% YoY revenue growth, BITF's significant net losses and rising costs, especially from Argentina, weigh on near-term profitability. The Stronghold acquisition and US energy pipeline are expected to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency into 2026. BITF trades at a fair valuation with potential upside, but execution of the buyback and asset growth are crucial for future performance. I have watched the evolution of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin mining, which has evolved from a small-scale venture to an energy-intensive operation conducted on an industrial scale. Over the last five years, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has increased by 967.82%. Back in 2022, I wrote about MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) as a solid tracker of BTC, and it is up 703.95% (since then). Earlier on, I had focused on CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and its expanded mining activities, including sustainable mining, and the stock has since gained 19.09% (from 2021). In this article, I will explain why I am rating Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ) as a hold in light of the company’s buyback plan and its renewed focus on the US as a strategic location for growth. However, I will consider the growth in net losses ahead of Q2 2025 earnings that may hamper the stock’s rally into 2026, if it persists. Bitfarms’ Strategic Realignments Into 2026 Bitfarms, a Canadian operator of data centers and a Bitcoin miner, is set to purchase 10% of its public float (of 499 million shares) in a share buyback plan beginning on July 28, 2025, and continuing through July 27, 2026. This 1-year program will see BITF retire about 49,943,031 common shares. As of July 29, 2025, BITF had a market capitalization of $710.32 million and an outstanding share balance of 557,548,857. At the current price of $1.24 (per share), BITF is likely to spend $62 million in the buyback plan. This change is likely to increase the share price past $1.30, and an increase in the market cap, as it will be seen in this article. The acquisition of Stronghold by BITF in Q1 2025 also set the stage for the company’s expanded opportunities in the US (to about 80% of its North America energy portfolio, against 20% - international), which will prove pivotal in the future. It is all about the vertical integration and control of its power with the US exposure. In essence, a Bitcoin miner’s proximity to ample sustainable energy (in this AI race) is critical for revenue growth and cost optimization. Then again, the reduced rewards for blocks after BTC halving in 2024 also warrant BITF's growth into high-performance computing (HPC) and AI to create long-term value for shareholders. Q1 2025 saw BITF record a 32.8% (YoY) revenue growth to $66.8 million against a net loss of $35.9 million vs. a net loss of $6 million in Q1 2024. Costs of revenues in Q1 2025 rose to an all-time quarterly high of $67.4 million. This increase is partly attributed to the acquisition of Stronghold Digital and asset write-down in Argentina. Revenues in Argentina declined 40% (YoY) to $6.955 million in Q1 2025 from $11.576 million in Q1 2024. The company also explained in its Q1 2025 management analysis that the supply of electricity to its Argentine facility in Rio Cuarto had been halted, affecting the intended long-term contract of up to 210 MW. In regard to operational efficiency, about half of the company's revenue ($37.3 million) was proceeds from the sale of 428 BTC (from the total 693 BTC earned in the quarter) at an average price of $87,000. Seeking Alpha Currently, BTC is selling at $118,140, indicating an increase of about 36% (from the last sale by BITF), slightly shy of its all-time high of +$120,000. Despite the high net losses, BITF has developed its culture of paying for its expenses using operating revenues that have been growing into 2026. Looking forward, BITF now has the energy infrastructure to reach the intended upside exposure coupled with rising BTC prices. By Q2 2025, BITF has about 1,166 BTC recorded in its balance sheet, and it has an opportunity to invest a significant amount of capital into its HPC and AI. Further, about 37.7% of its cost of revenues, or about $25.408 million, was attributed to energy expenses, which will be significantly reduced with the acquisition of Stronghold and the US expansion that is set to give a growth energy pipeline of nearly 1.1 GW in the US state of Pennsylvania (in the long run). As of May 2025, the total contracted energy capacity in BITF’s 15 BTC data centers (spread between North and South America) stood at 908 MW. Thus, the operationalization of the Stronghold energy pipeline will help to lower BITF’s costs into 2026 and improve the company’s profitability. Valuation I will use the net asset value per share metric to evaluate BITF since the company has a steady asset cover against liabilities. BITF has high net losses that undermine profitability, thereby making the price-to-earnings ratio ineffective. BITF’s net losses have increased 500% (YoY) in Q1 2025, while the adjusted EBITDA dropped 35% (YoY) to $15.1 million, down from $23.32 million in Q1 2024. I believe net asset value per share will provide a stable valuation, and I will then use this metric to determine the future price of the company. As of Q1 2025, BITF’s asset balance stood at $777.003 million against liabilities valued at $112.294 million. Total equity into Q2 2025 is $664.709. It is noteworthy that BITF is expected to reduce its outstanding share balance by 10%, meaning that the outstanding share balance in 2026 (from the buyback plan discussed earlier) will be 507,605,826 shares. We will get the future price of $1.31 by dividing the total equity of $664.709 million by the expected outstanding share balance. This calculation shows that BITF's future price will be trading at a fair valuation of +5.65% (YoY). We have to keep in mind that the growth in BITF’s US activities will increase the asset balance by 2026, thereby leading to a subsequent increase in the total equity. Asset Liabilities Net asset value (total equity) Outstanding share balance Future share price Current share price Valuation difference BITF $777.003 million $112.294 million $$664.709 million 507.606 million $1.31 $1.24 +5.65% (trading at fair valuation) Rezolve AI PLC ( RZLV ) $19.8 million $57.8 million -$38 million 243.7 million shares $0.16 $2.75 -94.2% (greatly overvalued) Cognyte Software Ltd. ( CGNT ) $491.5 million $275.7 million $215.8 million 72.9 million $2.96 $9.12 -67.54% (greatly overvalued) CLSK $2.657 billion $766.5 million $1.891 billion 280.9 million shares $6.73 $11.73 -42.63% (overvalued) MSTR $43.92 billion $10.394 billion $33.526 billion 273.4 million $122.63 $394.66 -68.93% (overvalued) As seen in this net asset valuation analysis, only BITF is trading at a fair valuation with a potential upside into 2026. RZLV has a negative equity balance, meaning that it is insolvent (as far as its liabilities are concerned). MSTR and CLSK have a strong balance sheet as far as their asset values to liabilities are concerned. However, these companies have recorded significant dilution or an increase in the number of outstanding shares, that have led to lower forecasts. For instance, MSTR realized a 54.11% (YoY) growth in its outstanding share balance from 177.4 million shares as of March 2024 to 273.4 million by March 2025. CLSK realized a 23.26% (YoY) growth in its outstanding share balance in 2025, which has negatively impacted this forecast into 2026 despite the company's robust asset balance. Risk I have factored in the buyback plan announced by BITF in my valuation. Failure to actualize this share repurchase program will adversely affect BITF’s share performance, as elucidated in this article. I also expect the company to grow its asset cover into 2026 as it advances its US activities by stabilizing its energy infrastructure. Bottom-Line I have rated Bitfarms Holdings as a hold in this analysis with a focus on its buyback plan and continued expansion into the US. However, the company realized significant net losses into Q2 2025 that have dampened profitability. Still, my analysis shows the company is trading at a fair valuation with a potential upside into 2026. I will be looking forward to the release of its Q2 2025 earnings in August 2025 for the update.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806658-bitfarms-ltd-optimistic-with-the-buyback-plan-and-us-exposure-into-2026?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING","BTC-USD|BITF|BITF:CA",cryptocompare
2025-07-31T10:22:22,"XYZ Positioned for 1200% Surge as Bitcoin ETF Inflows Accelerate and Ethereum ETFs Maintain Strong Uptrend","XYZ sits on the brink of a twelvefold leap, pushed by fresh money rushing into Bitcoin ETFs while Ethereum funds post solid growth. Analysts point to a rare mix of supply pressure, strong demand, and improving market mood. If these tails hold, XYZ could chart one of the year’s boldest climbs, drawing sharp eyes across the market in coming weeks. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin spent the week drifting, sliding about 1.55 % and sitting in a narrow band between 116040 and 121488. That mild dip hides a firmer trend: the coin is still up around 9 % for the month and nearly 13 % over six months, showing buyers have not stepped aside for long. Short-term signals look mixed. The 10-day moving average rests just under 118000 while the 100-day line is a touch higher, so price is pressing on both. The strength index sits near 52, a neutral spot, yet the stochastic reading above 80 hints at a market that could be getting tired. A negative MACD level backs the idea of slower momentum in the immediate run. For the next move, 112681 is the nearby floor; slipping through it could open a slide toward 107232, roughly a 9 % drop from the mid-range price. On the upside, a push past 123578 would clear room toward 129026, about a 7 % jump. Given the steadier gains over one and six months, odds still lean to a grind higher, but the coin needs a clean break over 123578 to reignite the rally. Ethereum (ETH) Source: TradingView Ethereum now bounces between 3631 and 4001 after a weekly rise of 1.94%. The gain looks small next to the breathtaking 52.72% leap logged over the last month, and the 17.57% lift seen across six months. Momentum cooled this week, but bulls still have the larger trend on their side. The 10-day and 100-day averages sit almost on top of each other near 3800, a sign of balance. RSI at 54.84 stays neutral, yet a high stochastic at 85.57 suggests the market may be running hot. MACD is flat. A push above 4001 is needed to attack the first barrier at 4127; slipping under 3631 could drag price to the next floor at 3387. If bulls seize momentum, a move to 4127 would add roughly 5% from the mid-range, and stretching to 4497 would hand out nearly 15%. Bears want the opposite story. A slide to 3387 subtracts about 10%, and a deeper dip to 3017 would erase close to 20%. The coming sessions will show which side wins. Conclusion BTC and ETH remain solid amid inflows, yet XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% gains through community-driven sports GameFi, offering early adopters the next cultural icon.

2025-07-31T10:08:45,"Five ancient miner wallets reawakened, consolidating their 50 BTC","Ancient wallets keep moving their coins, as BTC easily trades near its all-time high. Five notable miner wallets from 2010 moved 250 BTC in the past day. BTC from 2010 moved from miner wallets, showing not all inactive holders lead to lost coins. A total of five early wallets moved 250 Bitcoin, becoming a part of the trend for old coins to be shifted around or sold. The five miner wallets probably belonged to the same individual, as they were consolidated in two new addresses. One of the new wallets contained over $11M, while the other wallet held 150 BTC valued at over $17.7M. The coins were mined when market prices were under $0.10. All the block rewards were received on the same day, during the time when Satoshi Nakamoto was also producing blocks. The miner moved the coins as Bitcoin recovered above $118,000, with still robust spot demand. Whales have proven to be long-term holders, but also ready to take profits at the market peak. Previously, miners were awakened from dormancy during the late 2024 market rally, with one ancient whale sending 50 BTC directly to Binance. Bitcoin moves from untouched block rewards The Bitcoin moved all came from untouched block rewards of 50 coins, received on April 2010. The wallets come from the Satoshi era, mined at a much lower difficulty and minimal electricity expenses. 5 miner wallets woke up after being dormant for over 15 years and transferred 250 $BTC ($29.6M) out an hour ago. These miner wallets earned 50 $BTC each from mining on Apr 26, 2010. Wallets: 1NuqAKeX6JzW372QfEe7eFkewFx21fnqd3 12EWRT19v2eAvWjGDWjodCe7NP1CzmFphT… pic.twitter.com/vGttaE6MxY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2025 As with other addresses from before 2011, the wallets in question were dusted with an op_return transaction, issuing a pseudo-legal claim on the coins. While the attack is unable to really establish ownership over the coins, the transactions seem to have become a trigger for securing the ancient coins into new addresses. The recent miner selling arrived just a day after another ancient investor moved 3,963 BTC . The relatively small amounts of coins are not able to affect the market, which recently absorbed sales of 80K BTC without crashing the price. However, old miner coins with no history may be valuable to treasuries. Small-scale treasury buyers can join the top 100 of corporate holders with as low as 29 Bitcoin, meaning even a few older BTC can help create the basis for reserves with provable origin. Miner reserves turn lower on profit-taking Prominent mining companies often retain their coins, forming an organic treasury. Big-scale entities like Mara Holdings have expanded their wallets above 50,000 BTC. Overall, miners decreased their reserves from 1.9M Bitcoin down to 1.8M, based on Cryptoquant data . Despite this, hashrate remains high, barring seasonal fluctuations due to low hydroelectric power resources. Based on the hash ribbon indicator, miners are producing blocks very close to distress conditions. This time, there is no clear miner capitulation, but some are taking profits to make use of the low production price of their older BTC. The selling may also be a part of the pivot to AI data centers, which some of the biggest mining companies have taken up. The Bitcoin hashrate is back above 915 EH/s, with difficulty near its all-time high. Mining remains extremely competitive, though companies are still ready to build mining facilities for their own use, or to lend hashrate.

2025-07-31T10:00:49,"White House Crypto Policy Report Looms: What It Means for Bitcoin and XRP Whales","The crypto world is holding its breath as the White House prepares to release its first comprehensive cryptocurrency policy report on July 30, 2025, including an important section on Bitcoin and XRP. Dubbed a “regulatory Bible” by insiders, the report stems from President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 and aims to provide sweeping guidance on digital asset oversight, stablecoin rules, and national security concerns. Chaired by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with key contributions from SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has spent the last six months drafting what could become the foundation for U.S. crypto regulation for years to come. With growing political interest and pending crypto bills in Congress, this policy release is expected to influence not just lawmaking, but also market sentiment, especially around Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. Strategic Bitcoin Reserves and Government Holdings A highly anticipated section of the report will focus on the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings, rumored to be around 198,000 BTC, worth over $23 billion. However, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosures suggest that only 28,988 BTC may currently be under federal control. The report may also outline a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve strategy, first proposed by Trump in March, possibly indicating budget-neutral methods to accumulate more BTC. If confirmed, this move could influence global crypto adoption and attract more institutional investment. XRP Whales Bet Big Ahead of Policy Reveal Meanwhile, XRP whales have opened $25 million in long positions, anticipating favorable U.S. policy for domestically-rooted digital assets. Technical analysts cite a bullish pennant pattern with upside potential to $5.96 if current momentum holds. The convergence of regulatory clarity, potential reserve accumulation, and strategic legislation may push Bitcoin past $123,000 and ignite an XRP rally, marking the start of a new era in U.S. crypto policy and market behavior. As crypto markets await today’s 2:30 p.m. briefing, traders, investors, and regulators are aligned in anticipation of what could be a turning point for digital asset adoption in the U.S. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/white-house-crypto-policy-report-loomsbitcoin-xrp/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK","Ripple|bitcoin|btc|btcusd|ripple|XRP|XRPUSD",cryptocompare
2025-07-31T10:00:23,"Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the Hidden Winner At $0.035 While Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines Near $119K for a Third Straight Day?","While Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck in a consolidation phase near the $119,000 mark for several consecutive days, the spotlight is quietly shifting to an under-the-radar DeFi contender—Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum among investors who are now actively looking beyond traditional blue-chip cryptocurrencies. What makes this protocol stand out isn’t price alone—it’s the well-structured, utility-driven ecosystem that backs the MUTM token with real DeFi mechanics and tangible value generation. Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines for a Third Straight Day Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stagnant near $119,000 for three consecutive days, trading at ~$118,421 with a 0.39% 24-hour decline, as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite record ETF inflows exceeding $55 billion, including $157.02 million recently, BTC struggles to break the $120,000 resistance, with support at $116,000. On-chain data shows 40,000 BTC ($4.7B) flowed to exchanges recently, signaling profit-taking, while miners’ revenue pressures (MPI at 2.78) add headwinds. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests a potential breakout, but low 7-day volatility (1.34%) indicates indecision. Institutional demand, driven by BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B+), remains robust, yet macro uncertainty from U.S.-China trade talks and a neutral Altcoin Season Index (51) dampen momentum. A break above $119,500 could target $122,000, but failure may see a dip to $112,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building During Bitcoin’s Pause Bitcoin’s stability in the short term might signal uncertainty, but while large-cap assets consolidate, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building from the ground up. The platform is not just a simple lending protocol—it represents a shift toward decentralized finance infrastructure that combines borrowing, lending, passive earnings, and native stablecoin integration within one framework. This makes it an ecosystem, not just a token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique Pooled-to-Contract (P2C) lending model enables users to deposit assets such as USDT, DAI, ETH, or BTC and receive mtTokens, which serve as interest-bearing tokens representing their share in the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on real-time pool utilization. Users can then stake these mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards—rewards that are consistently bought back from the open market using the platform’s revenue. This closed-loop reward system avoids inflation and aligns the interests of both protocol users and token holders. Meanwhile, the borrowing side offers overcollateralized loans using stable or blue-chip assets. For example, a borrower depositing $10,000 in ETH at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio would receive $6,000 in liquidity—without having to sell their ETH. This model enables users to retain their asset exposure while accessing capital, a key incentive during sideways or bullish markets. Lenders, in turn, benefit from competitive APYs reaching 10–12%, especially during high utilization periods. For those seeking higher risk-reward strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This secondary model allows lenders to negotiate terms directly with borrowers—especially useful for newer or riskier memecoins like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP. While it’s not the protocol’s core feature, it adds optionality for experienced users and demonstrates how the ecosystem is engineered for diverse DeFi participants. Security-conscious investors will also take note of the project’s CertiK audit, boasting a Token Security Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78—demonstrating transparency and a commitment to protocol integrity. Moreover, the team is actively encouraging public participation with a $50,000 bug bounty program, while marketing efforts are being reinforced through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The Numbers That Matter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised $13.8 million, with 14,700+ unique holders participating in the early rounds. As demand continues to build, the token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This rapid accumulation signals growing confidence in the platform, especially from users who are looking for strong upside potential rather than waiting for another BTC rally. The total token supply is 4 billion MUTM, and at a planned listing price of $0.06, those who got in at Phase 1 ($0.01) would be looking at 6x returns, while even current Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 could be eyeing a solid 70% upside before listing. However, internal projections are significantly more ambitious. Analysts covering this presale have floated future price targets as high as $1.50, which would imply over 42x growth from the current entry point. Add to this a growing social base, with 12,000+ Twitter followers and rising engagement from the DeFi community, and it becomes clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a solid foundation before its launch. The platform is also integrating a Layer-2 solution, ensuring scalability and lower transaction costs—two major pain points in legacy DeFi protocols. While meme coins and speculative tokens dominate headlines, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent the evolution of smart money. It’s not about the noise—it’s about the structure, utility, and reward logic that gives real-world function to crypto investment. With mtTokens unlocking yield and the MUTM ecosystem rewarding users via staking and revenue-driven buybacks, this is a project actively constructing long-term value—not just marketing hype. As Bitcoin flatlines, the smart capital is already rotating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced to move, structured to last, and positioned for exponential growth.
