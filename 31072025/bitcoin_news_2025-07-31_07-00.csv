2025-07-31T04:53:41,"Robinhood Q2 Earnings Outpace Expectations on Higher Crypto Activity — Here are the Numbers","Robinhood on Wednesday delivered another strong quarter as surging crypto activity and the integration of Bitstamp helped the trading platform exceed Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s earnings point to its rising influence in the digital asset market and its push to diversify beyond retail trading. For the second quarter of 2025, Robinhood reported revenue of $989m, a 45% year-on-year increase that beat analysts’ estimates of $908m. Earnings per share reached $0.42, topping the expected $0.31. Transaction-based revenues jumped 65%, with cryptocurrencies contributing significantly to the growth. Robinhood Markets has just released financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Check out the highlights from @vladtenev below, and catch our earnings call live at: https://t.co/W92tO1JASh pic.twitter.com/0Sm2N8ZN3w — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) July 30, 2025 USDG Stablecoin Launch Strengthens Robinhood’s EU Play Crypto revenue climbed 98% to $160m, fuelled by higher trading volumes and the benefits of its Bitstamp acquisition earlier this year. That deal has extended Robinhood’s regulatory footprint to more than 50 global licences, enabling crypto services in 30 European countries. Bitstamp’s $7b in trading volume since the acquisition also signals strong traction in Robinhood’s effort to challenge Coinbase in retail crypto trading. The company has expanded its product range in parallel. It launched USDG, a fully regulated stablecoin in the EU, and is preparing to roll out Bitcoin futures. Crypto staking services are now available to users in the US and Europe, offering yields on digital assets and boosting user engagement. Customer Accounts Climb to 26.5M With Strong Deposit Inflows Total platform assets nearly doubled year-on-year to $279b, driven partly by crypto valuation gains. Net deposits reached $13.8b, a 25% annualized growth rate, while funded customer accounts rose by 2.3m to 26.5m. Average revenue per user increased 34% to $151 as Robinhood’s crypto business and retail activity strengthened. Robinhood’s European expansion has extended beyond crypto. Tokenized US stocks and ETFs have gained momentum across the region, tapping into growing demand for fractional ownership. The company sees tokenization as a gateway to new markets, including real estate and art, as investors increasingly embrace digital assets. The Bitstamp acquisition, while strengthening Robinhood’s crypto capabilities, added $65m in costs for 2025. Management expects operating expenses for the year to total between $2.15b and $2.25b. Gold Subscription Base Jumps 76% to 3.5M Users Despite the higher costs, adjusted EBITDA margins reached 56%. Shares dipped slightly after the earnings release on concerns over expenses but remain up 185% year-to-date, reflecting investor confidence. Robinhood Gold, the company’s subscription service, remains a key driver. Subscriber numbers surged 76% to 3.5m, and high-yield cash sweep balances crossed $30b. Retirement accounts have also grown to $20b in assets, complementing Robinhood’s efforts to move into long-term wealth management. The company’s prediction markets saw nearly $1b in contracts traded last quarter, with crypto-related wagers drawing strong interest. Combined with tokenized assets and traditional products, the move strengthens Robinhood’s position as a multi-faceted platform catering to a wide spectrum of investors. Regulatory risk remains a concern for the crypto industry, but Robinhood’s proactive compliance stance, bolstered by Bitstamp’s licences, has provided an advantage. The company’s agility in capturing both meme-stock and crypto trading activity has driven a 420% return on its shares over the past 12 months.

2025-07-31T04:42:38,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss asked Trump to drop Brian Quintenz as CFTC nominee","Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss told President Trump over the weekend to walk away from Brian Quintenz as the next chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to Politico . They called him directly, just as the Senate was preparing to move forward with the nomination on Monday. The brothers, who are both known for founding Gemini and for backing Trump, said Quintenz doesn’t match the direction they believe the president wants the CFTC to go. They told Trump to his face; dump the guy. They said Quintenz, who had already served as a commissioner at the CFTC, was too comfortable in the job. They were not convinced he would push the kind of changes they think the agency needs to make to handle the crypto industry. One of the people present said they specifically raised concerns about how Brian supported expanding the CFTC’s budget so it could handle more crypto oversight. Winklevoss call stalls Senate vote That phone call hit hard enough to delay the vote. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which was about to push the nomination forward, stopped everything on Monday after a request from the White House. A spokesperson for the administration allegedly said later that Trump still supports Quintenz for the role, but inside the West Wing, it’s a fight now. Other officials are pushing Trump to stick with him, even as one of his closest crypto backers wants him gone. White House spokesperson Liz Huston confirmed the official line in a written statement: “Brian Quintenz remains President Trump’s nominee to serve as chairman of the CFTC. He will help execute President Trump’s mission of making America the crypto capital of the world and we look forward to his swift confirmation.” The twins aren’t speaking publicly yet, but their decision proves just how much access some crypto executives now have inside Trump’s Washington. Quintenz was originally picked back in February. At the time, both brothers celebrated the move online. On X, Cameron called him “exactly the leader the CFTC needs.” Tyler added, “Great choice for crypto and for America.” But since then, things have changed. Past tensions between Gemini and the CFTC resurface Part of that shift traces back to what happened earlier this year. In January, Gemini agreed to pay $5 million in a settlement with the CFTC. The case centered around claims that the company gave misleading information about one of its crypto products. The fine wasn’t the end of it. Gemini later fired back in a letter to the agency’s internal watchdog, saying some of the CFTC’s attorneys acted “with a selfish desire to advance their careers by misusing their offices to obtain a high-profile ‘win’ against Gemini.” That case might have left a mark. While the Winklevoss brothers haven’t said publicly that this is the reason for their switch on Quintenz, the timing lines up. The fact that Brian had ties to the agency during their clash is not something they’ve forgotten. And they clearly don’t think he’s the one to fix the culture there. Brian spent the last few years working on crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most powerful VC firms in Silicon Valley. He also held a board seat at Kalshi, a startup focused on prediction markets. That background helped get him wide support in both the traditional finance world and from crypto insiders… until now. Historically, the CFTC has handled commodities like corn and oil, but crypto has pulled it into a much larger role. Trump’s current plan involves giving the agency direct oversight over tokens like bitcoin and ether. That would make the next chair a major power player in crypto regulation. Tyler and Cameron want someone who will go into the CFTC and do more than just keep things running. They want someone who will clean house. The nomination is still technically active. But after the call from the Winklevoss twins and the canceled vote, everything is now on pause. Whether Trump sticks with Brian or drops him remains to be seen.

2025-07-31T04:39:59,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $1 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7805 Market Cap $27.64B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.22B Circulating Supply 35.41B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7859 24-hour Low $0.7426 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 15.58% 50-day SMA $0.6808 14-Day RSI 54.77 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (63%) 200-day SMA $0.6098 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Short-term indicators reveal a significant volume increase despite calm price action. Cardano could continue consolidation between $0.76-$0.85 in the meantime. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Indicators suggest imminent price breakout Cardano’s daily chart for July 31 shows a classic triangle consolidation pattern that has been developing since mid-July, with the price currently trading at $0.7793. The Bollinger Bands show the price oscillating around the middle band at $0.8009, indicating neutral momentum in the near term. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator sits close to the zero line with minimal divergence, suggesting that directional momentum remains muted as the triangle pattern reaches its apex. This technical setup typically resolves with a significant move in either direction, and the recent green candle formation hints at potential buying interest returning to the market. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Volatility reduces as volume surges The 4-hour chart shows Cardano at $0.7792 with a slight decline of 0.04%. The Alligator indicator’s three moving averages are converging tightly, which traditionally signals a period of low volatility before a potential breakout. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView Trading volume has spiked significantly to 142.48M, indicating increased accumulation activity despite the relatively calm price movements. The recent candle formations show intraday volatility, but the overall structure suggests accumulation rather than distribution. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.751233 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.799978 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.830368 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.786796 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.679134 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.702772 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.610757 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.749931 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.718983 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.694069 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.686684 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.713869 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.747688 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.723228 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano seems to be gearing up for a decisive move within the next few trading sessions. The daily triangle pattern is nearing completion, which typically results in a breakout of 10-15% in either direction, while the 4-hour chart’s volume surge and Alligator convergence support this potential move. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $2.45. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705. In July, the coin is trading between $0.7777 and $0.8287.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/,"ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS","Crypto Price Predictions|ADA",cryptocompare
