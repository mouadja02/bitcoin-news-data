Paula Comings, head of FX sales at US Bank, says in a new interview with Bloomberg that American importers have been reporting to her that their foreign export partners want to be paid in the euro, Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Comings notes that exporters want to limit their exposure to the dollar’s price movement. “A lot of clients previously were reluctant because dollars were sacred in the eyes of the supplier. Now the vibe from overseas vendors seems to be, ‘Just give us our currency.’” For example, one US Bank client, a lumber company from the Midwest, now uses euros to purchase hardwood imports from Europe, while a second, a homeware retailer, now plans to pay for imports from China with yuan. Both firms previously used dollars to pay exporters. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at 98.92 at time of writing. The index is up 5% in the past five days but down nearly 9% year to date. US Bank has $659.191 billion in total assets as of March 31st, 2025, per statistics from the Federal Reserve.

KuCoin said that through this integration, institutional clients can now trade on KuCoin without the need to pre-fund exchange wallets. Instead, assets remain securely held under BitGo Singapore’s regulated custody, introducing a separation of custody and execution that reduces counterparty risk and bolsters systemic resilience. Security, Flexibility, and Post-Trade Automation The firm said that this collaboration will give institutional clients access to KuCoin’s trading products—including spot, margin, options, and perpetual futures—through the Go Network. Clients will have access to custody with insurance coverage up to $250 million, automated post-trade settlement, and delegated trading access without compromising asset control. “Security and trust are the foundation for institutional adoption. We are proud to integrate with BitGo Singapore’s Go Network. This partnership represents a critical component of our $2 billion Trust Project and delivers a more resilient trading paradigm to institutional clients globally,” said Tika Lum, Head of Institutional Business Development at KuCoin. New Model for Crypto Trading? Off-exchange settlement is gaining traction across the industry as exchanges and institutional participants prioritize counterparty risk management. BitGo’s Go Network represents a mature infrastructure standard, already trusted by leading firms for secure digital asset trading. “Partnering with KuCoin on Go Network through BitGo Singapore marks a major step forward in building a more efficient trading ecosystem. This is how digital asset trading should be—secure, compliant, and built on trust,” said Brett Reeves, Head of Go Network at BitGo. With the $2 billion Trust Project as its foundation, KuCoin is reinforcing its commitment to developing trusted digital asset infrastructure. KuCoin BTC Reserves Collapse KuCoin saw a dramatic drop in its Bitcoin reserves since mid-2023, when it announced a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement. Since that period, the exchange has seen a 77% decline in its Bitcoin reserves. According to data compiled by Onchain School, KuCoin’s BTC reserves dropped from 18,300 BTC to just 4,100 BTC between June 5 and June 28, 2023. The outflow totaling over 14,000 BTC correlates closely with the timeline of KuCoin’s announcement to tighten its KYC procedures.

2025-06-19T16:30:00,"Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum’s Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum’s Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift Is the much-anticipated Altcoin recovery finally on the horizon? For many investors holding various digital assets, this is the burning question. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, attention is increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as the potential catalyst for broader market gains. Why is Ethereum Price Key to Altcoin Recovery? According to insights shared by experts like Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, the fate of many altcoins is currently tied directly to Ethereum’s performance. He suggests that for investors to see their altcoin positions return to profitability or achieve significant gains, ETH needs to demonstrate stronger momentum and resilience in the market. Think of it this way: Ethereum is the largest altcoin by market cap and serves as the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other altcoins built on its blockchain or EVM-compatible chains. When Ethereum is strong, it signals health and activity in this ecosystem, which often spills over positively into the performance of associated altcoins. Van de Poppe’s view highlights a crucial point: without a robust ETH showing, the capital needed to fuel significant rallies in smaller altcoins might remain stagnant or exit the market. A rising Ethereum price can increase confidence, liquidity, and risk appetite, all essential ingredients for an Altcoin season . Entering the ‘Ethereum Phase’ of the Crypto Market Adding weight to the narrative, on-chain analyst Willy Woo recently posited that the broader Crypto market is transitioning into what he terms an ‘Ethereum phase’. This suggests a potential shift in market dynamics where Ethereum, rather than just Bitcoin, becomes the primary driver or indicator of market sentiment and direction. Michaël van de Poppe agrees with Woo’s assessment of this fundamental shift. However, he notes a common disconnect: many investors remain unaware of this transition. They are still influenced by a lingering ‘markets are bad’ mindset, perhaps conditioned by previous downturns, and haven’t fully grasped Ethereum’s growing influence and potential leadership role in the current cycle. What might an ‘Ethereum phase’ entail? It could mean: Increased focus on Ethereum’s fundamentals (e.g., staking yields, network upgrades, EIPs). Higher correlation between ETH and many altcoins compared to the traditional BTC-altcoin correlation. Ethereum’s price movements acting as a leading indicator for specific sectors within the crypto market (like DeFi or NFTs). Greater institutional interest specifically in Ethereum as a programmable settlement layer and yield-bearing asset. Understanding this potential phase shift is vital for investors looking to navigate the coming months and capitalize on potential opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Examining the ETH Price Prediction Trajectory Beyond its fundamental role, the technical price action of Ethereum is also generating significant interest. Crypto analyst Ted has drawn parallels between Ethereum’s current trajectory and Bitcoin’s historical price movement during its 2017–2021 cycle. This comparison is significant because Bitcoin’s 2017-2021 period included its massive bull run. If Ethereum were to follow a similar path, it could imply substantial upside potential from current levels. Ted’s analysis suggests that a real parabolic move – a rapid, accelerating increase in price – could commence once ETH decisively breaks and sustains above the $4,000 mark. Hitting $4,000 would not only represent a significant psychological and technical resistance break but would also bring ETH closer to its previous all-time high. Surpassing this level could trigger a wave of positive sentiment, potentially leading to further price discovery and reinforcing the idea that the market is indeed entering a more bullish phase, supportive of Altcoin recovery . Challenges and Considerations While the outlook linking ETH strength to altcoin gains is compelling, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile. Unforeseen macroeconomic events or regulatory news could impact ETH and altcoins negatively. Bitcoin Dominance: While the narrative suggests an ‘Ethereum phase’, Bitcoin’s influence is still substantial. A strong BTC rally that pulls liquidity from altcoins could temporarily hinder the ‘Ethereum phase’ thesis. Execution Risks: While Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong, the successful execution of future upgrades is crucial for its long-term health and appeal. Altcoin Specific Risks: Even with a strong ETH, individual altcoins face unique risks related to their technology, team, adoption, and competition. Investors should conduct their own research and not solely rely on broad market trends or predictions. Diversification and risk management remain paramount. Conclusion: Watching Ethereum for the Next Big Move The consensus among several prominent analysts points towards Ethereum as the primary driver for the next wave of Altcoin recovery . From its fundamental role in the crypto ecosystem to its technical price trajectory mirroring past bull runs, ETH’s performance is seen as the crucial barometer for whether the broader Crypto market can enter a truly bullish phase. The idea of an ‘Ethereum phase’, where ETH leads the charge, is gaining traction, even if many retail investors haven’t fully recognized it yet. While price predictions like the move past $4,000 for a parabolic run offer exciting potential, it’s essential to remain aware of market dynamics and individual asset risks. Ultimately, for those waiting for an Altcoin season , keeping a close eye on Ethereum price action and network developments appears to be the most strategic approach.

2025-06-19T16:20:00,"Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill Big news out of the Buckeye State! The Ohio House of Representatives has taken a significant step that could make small cryptocurrency transactions much simpler for residents. In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community, lawmakers in Ohio have passed a bill aiming to exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from capital gains tax. This development is particularly relevant for anyone engaging in frequent, small-value trades or using crypto for minor purchases in the state. Understanding the Proposed Ohio Crypto Tax Exemption At the heart of this legislative effort is the desire to ease the tax burden and reporting complexity associated with small cryptocurrency transactions. Currently, under federal and typically state law, selling, trading, or using cryptocurrency for goods and services can trigger a taxable event. If the value of the crypto has increased since you acquired it, you could owe capital gains tax on that appreciation, even on very small amounts. The bill recently passed by the Ohio House seeks to create an exemption for this. Specifically, it targets transactions where the gain realized is less than $200. This means if you buy crypto, and later sell it, trade it for another crypto, or use it to buy something, and the profit (the difference between the sale price and your cost basis) is less than $200, that specific gain would be exempt from state capital gains tax in Ohio. This is a crucial detail – the exemption applies to the *gain*, not the total transaction value. Let’s break down what this exemption aims to address: Micro-Transactions: Using crypto for everyday purchases, like buying a coffee or a small item, can currently create complex tax reporting obligations for tiny gains. Frequent Small Trades: Active traders making many small profitable trades face a significant tracking burden. Tax Complexity: Many users find calculating and reporting capital gains tax on crypto confusing, especially for small amounts. By introducing this exemption, Ohio lawmakers hope to remove some of these hurdles, potentially encouraging greater use and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the state without creating unintended tax headaches for minor activities. What is the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act? The bill carrying this significant crypto tax exemption is formally known as the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. While the tax provision is a headline feature, the act’s name suggests it might encompass broader legislative efforts related to blockchain technology and digital assets within the state. Legislation labeled as ‘Basics Acts’ often aims to establish foundational legal definitions, rights, and frameworks for emerging technologies. The passage of this act in the House with a strong 70-26 vote indicates significant bipartisan support for creating a more favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Ohio. It signals that state legislators are actively considering how to integrate these technologies into the existing legal and economic structure, starting with fundamental issues like taxation. While the full text of the bill likely covers more than just the tax exemption, this specific provision is the most immediately impactful for individual cryptocurrency users. It positions Ohio as one of the states exploring ways to adapt its tax code to the unique nature of digital assets and the potential for frequent, low-value transactions. How Does This Impact Cryptocurrency Tax Reporting for Ohio Residents? If this bill becomes law, it would directly affect how Ohio residents calculate and report their state-level capital gains tax related to crypto. Currently, any gain, no matter how small, is technically subject to tax and reporting requirements. The proposed exemption would create a specific carve-out. Consider these scenarios: Scenario A: You bought 0.01 ETH for $200. Later, you sell it for $210. Your gain is $10. Under the proposed law, this $10 gain would likely be exempt from Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario B: You bought 0.1 BTC for $3,000. Later, you sell it for $3,250. Your gain is $250. Since this gain is over the $200 threshold, the full $250 gain would still be subject to Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario C: You use 0.005 BTC (which you acquired for $100) to buy a $150 item. At the time of the transaction, that 0.005 BTC was worth $150. Your gain is $50 ($150 value received – $100 cost basis). This $50 gain would likely be exempt. Important Note: This exemption, if enacted, would only apply to Ohio state capital gains tax. Federal capital gains tax rules, which currently do not have such a de minimis exemption for crypto, would still apply. Ohio residents would still need to track all transactions for federal reporting purposes. The primary benefit here is reducing the state-level tax liability and potentially simplifying state tax filings for those with only small crypto gains. However, the need for diligent record-keeping doesn’t disappear entirely, as users still need to determine if a gain exceeds the $200 threshold and track their cost basis for all transactions for federal tax purposes. The Road Ahead: Senate and Governor’s Desk Passing the House is a significant hurdle cleared, but the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act is not yet law. The bill must now make its way through the Ohio State Senate. The Senate will review the bill, potentially hold committee hearings, and may propose amendments before holding a vote. If the Senate passes the bill, it will then head to the desk of Governor Mike DeWine for his signature. The Governor has the power to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature after a certain period. Given the strong House vote, there is positive momentum, but passage in the Senate and approval by the Governor are still necessary steps. The legislative process can be complex, and the exact timeline is uncertain. Those interested in seeing this crypto tax exemption become law should follow its progress through the Senate. Why is This Crypto Tax Exemption Significant for Ohio? This move by the Ohio House is more than just a tax tweak; it’s a statement. It signals that Ohio is serious about understanding and potentially fostering the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries within its borders. By addressing one of the major pain points for crypto users – the complexity of tax reporting on small gains – the state aims to make engaging with digital assets less cumbersome. Potential benefits for Ohio include: Attracting Innovation: A clear and favorable regulatory environment, even on tax matters, can make Ohio more attractive to blockchain companies and developers. Encouraging Adoption: Reducing the tax burden on small transactions could encourage more residents and businesses to use crypto for payments or small investments. Setting a Precedent: Ohio could become an example for other states looking to modernize their tax laws for digital assets. While a $200 exemption might seem modest in the context of large crypto investments, it directly impacts the most frequent types of transactions and the broadest base of users who might be experimenting with or using crypto for minor purposes. It’s a practical step that addresses a real-world friction point. Potential Criticisms or Challenges Despite the positive reception from many in the crypto community, the bill isn’t without potential points of discussion or criticism: Limited Scope: The $200 gain threshold is relatively low compared to the potential value of larger crypto holdings. It primarily benefits those with small gains. Tracking Still Required: Users still need to track their cost basis and sale price for *all* transactions to determine if a gain occurred and whether it falls under the $200 threshold for state exemption. This doesn’t eliminate the need for good record-keeping. Federal vs. State Discrepancy: Having different rules for state and federal tax can add another layer of complexity for taxpayers and tax professionals. These points highlight that while the bill is a step forward, the landscape of cryptocurrency tax remains complex, and users must stay informed and maintain meticulous records regardless of exemption thresholds. What Actionable Insights Should Ohio Residents Take? For cryptocurrency holders in Ohio, the most important takeaway right now is to stay informed. The bill has passed the House but is not yet law. Keep an eye on its progress through the Senate and towards the Governor’s office. Regardless of the bill’s final status, continue to practice diligent record-keeping for all your cryptocurrency transactions. This includes recording: The date of the transaction The type of cryptocurrency The number of units bought, sold, or traded The value of the transaction in U.S. dollars at the time Your cost basis (the price you paid for the crypto) The nature of the transaction (buy, sell, trade, spend) Using crypto tax software or maintaining a detailed spreadsheet can be invaluable. If the bill becomes law, you will need these records to identify which gains, if any, qualify for the state exemption. Conclusion: A Positive Step for Ohio Crypto Tax The passage of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act, including its crypto tax exemption for gains under $200, by the State House is a significant and positive development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Ohio. It demonstrates a legislative willingness to address practical challenges faced by individuals engaging with digital assets and positions the state as forward-thinking in its approach to blockchain technology. While the bill still has further steps to clear before becoming law, its progress reflects growing recognition among policymakers of the need to adapt tax regulations to the realities of the digital economy. This move could encourage greater participation in the crypto space within Ohio and potentially inspire similar legislative efforts in other states, contributing to a clearer and more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies nationwide.

Approximately $3.9 billion worth of options contracts will reach expiration on Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange. $3.9 Billion in Crypto Options to Expire on Deribit as Investors Turn Bullish on Ethereum This event is expected to cause significant volatility in both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets. Of the total, $3.3 billion is made up of the notional value of Bitcoin options. The Put/Call ratio is at 1.16, indicating a slight downtrend as traders hold more put options than calls. However, the maximum pain point is set at $106,000, which is the price at which the option will become worthless, suggesting a relatively neutral positioning. Market data suggests that BTC options are clustered around this level, suggesting a balanced outlook from investors ahead of expiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum options total $546 million and the Put/Call ratio is just 0.68, a clear sign of bullish sentiment among traders. The maximum pain price for ETH is $2,600, but option activity is weighted towards call positions, indicating strong expectations for an upward price movement. The concept of maximum pain, where the most options expire worthless, is often cited as a short-term price magnet during expiration events. As such, current levels of $106,000 for BTC and $2,600 for ETH could act as centers of attraction in the hours leading up to expiration. While Bitcoin's market positioning appears cautious, Ethereum's bullish momentum could lead to increased volatility and potential upside moves, especially if the overall market sentiment remains positive. Traders and analysts will be watching closely to see if these expectations come true or if surprise moves disrupt the charts in the final hours before contracts close. *This is not investment advice.

Most tokens have held their crucial price levels as Bitcoin trades range-bound within the $105,000 vicinity. Altcoins saw mixed movements in the last 24 hours, with many signaling potential momentum shifts to bullish. Ethereum holds above its key support of $2,500, while Raydium and Mantle stole the show with substantial gains over the past day. Ethereum holds $2,500 amid institutional inflows The largest altcoin by market cap has remained resilient as the crypto industry ignored the Israel-Iran conflict. ETH trades at $2,534 at press time, and the shifting sentiments indicate imminent recoveries. However, institutional accumulation suggests investor confidence in Ethereum’s performance. SoSoValue data shows US ETH spot exchange-traded funds have seen a single red day in the past ten days. Source – SoSoValue Maintaining the prevailing bullishness could see the token soaring to the nearest resistance at $2,699. Bulls should push Ethereum above this level to shift its short-term outlook to bullish. Nevertheless, losing grounds at $2,500 would trigger notable dips to the reliable support zone at $2,395. Weakness at this foothold might open the path to the psychological mark of $2,000. RAY skyrockets on Upbit listing Raydium dominated crypto trends on Thursday following its sharp jump to an intraday high of $2.6279. It has gained approximately 35% since yesterday. RAY was trading at $2.22 after brief corrections from its daily peak. Chart by Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by over 600%, indicating renewed trader interest in the altcoin. The bullish momentum emerged after South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit, confirmed listing Raydium’s USDT and KRW trading pairs. However, the question remains. Can Raydium sustain the prevailing rally and switch it to long-term gains? The token exhibits massive volatility, calling for caution. Further, the latest rebound comes after an extended struggle, with RAY lowering about 30% of its value the previous month. While it can stretch its current upside, the alt remains poised for notable declines once the “Upbit optimism” diminishes. However, reclaiming the vital region between $2.60 and $2.70 could trigger substantial gains to the resistance at $3.5. MNT soars as Mantle launches UR crypto bank Mantle’s native token joined the upside party, climbing from the $0.5591 low to $0.6305 at press time. Chart by Coinmarketcap That translates to a 15% increase since yesterday. News of Mantle launching UR , a crypto-first digital bank, kick-started MNT’s rally. UR is a borderless crypto neobank that aims to bridge traditional finance with DeFi by allowing users to save, spend, and more in one account. MNT exhibits robust bullishness amidst the impressive ecosystem developments. The altcoin will likely extend its rally before possible declines.

BTC’s price remains above $100,000 while other top cryptocurrencies continue to trade within their pre-war ranges amid fear of an economic shake-up resulting from the Israel-Iran war. Analysts believe the robustness of the crypto market amid heightening global tension is a testament to the technology’s decentralization. Crypto is universal, and no individual or group can control it. It differs from national currencies that rely on a country’s economic policies and fiscal performance.

2025-06-19T15:40:25,"Trump Linked Firm Trims Stake in Major Crypto Venture, Big Sell-Off Ahead?","Per a report from Forbes, companies tied to the US President Donald Trump reduced their exposure to World Liberty Financial (WLF). These entities sold around 20% of their stake in this company, reducing from 60% to 40%. Donald Trump Takes Money Off the Table The report claims that while the US President is not directly involved in these transactions, there is someone with a strong connection to the Oval Office operating in his behalf. Several reports claimed that Trump and his family have already made millions of dollars from their crypto investments. WLF has been one of the most lucrative ventures for the Trump family. Announced in September last year, the company contributed $30 million to the Trump treasury, Forbes claims. In addition, a separate report claims that Barron Trump, Donald Trump’s youngest son, has made over $40 million for his participation in World Liberty Financial. With the help of his older brothers, Don Jr. and Eric, Barron worked as a promoter and a ‘Web3 Ambassador’ for the company and a co-founder. The company netted $200 million for the Trump family in January. Following this performance, the company experienced a series of changes in its business structure, including a reduction in the Trump’s family participation from 75% to 60% to the now reported 40%. In that sense, the Trumps seem to be reducing their stake progressively. Neither the Trumps or representatives for World Liberty Financial have commented on the reasons behind the sales. However, the report speculates that due to the performance in the company and its success, the Trumps might be taking a profit while the bullish momentum rises. Many experts have been critical to these behavior from Trump and his closest family openly calling corruption. Expert on political history for the University of Princeton, Julian Zelizer, stated the following: To me, Trump’s crypto dealings seem pretty explicit. Policy decisions are being made regarding parts of the financial industry that are being done not to benefit the nation, but his own financial interests … It’s hard to imagine what he’s doing benefits the nation. Is Donald Trump Preparing for a Crypto Winter? At the time of writing, the crypto market is undergoing a sell off. The top cryptocurrencies by market cap Bitcoin and Ethereum record between 3% and 10% losses over the past week. The sector is potentially heading for a sluggish summer. Per the trading firm QCP Capital, several factors on the macroeconomic scene and seasonality will push the Bitcoin price and the altcoin market into a prolonged low volatility environment. Mainly, the Trumps and other institutional investors might be pulling away for the summer leaving the crypto market in a cautious stalemate. QCP stated : Summer sluggishness has set in for crypto. BTC implied volatility is back below 40%, erasing its recent spike. Risk reversals are still negative, suggesting cautious sentiment.

The platform, formerly known as Twitter, will ""soon"" allow users to make investments or trades on the platform, CEO Linda Yaccarino told the newspaper in an interview at the Cannes Lions advertising festival.

This forms part of Musk's ambition to turn X into a super app, akin to the Chinese WeChat, which offers numerous retail and financial services as well as messaging.

2025-06-19T15:30:49,"Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point","Ethereum is trading within a tight range that has held for several weeks, forming the kind of compression structure that often leads to a significant breakout. Despite heightened volatility in global markets driven by escalating tensions in the Middle East, ETH has remained resilient, holding strong above key demand zones around the $2,500–$2,600 area. The current environment is marked by uncertainty, with geopolitical conflict and macroeconomic risks weighing on investor sentiment. Yet Ethereum’s price structure suggests that bulls are patiently building momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook, pointing out that Ethereum is mirroring the same consolidation pattern that Bitcoin followed during its 2017–2021 cycle. In that historical setup, BTC compressed into a tight range before entering a parabolic rally once the upper boundary was broken. If Ethereum follows a similar path, the next move could be dramatic, especially if it clears major resistance levels like $2,800. As long as ETH holds range support and absorbs both upside and downside wicks, this setup remains intact. A breakout above the current range could ignite a fresh leg up for Ethereum—and possibly spark renewed strength across the altcoin market. Ethereum Builds Momentum As Market Awaits Clarity Ethereum is currently trading in a tight range, consolidating just above the $2,600 level and holding firm despite macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. After rallying nearly 80% from its April lows, ETH appears to be preparing for a decisive move in the coming sessions. However, with escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and uncertainty surrounding possible U.S. involvement, broader markets remain cautious. Until clarity emerges on the geopolitical front, sideways price action may persist. Still, Ethereum’s price structure remains constructive. Strong consolidation above key demand zones reflects ongoing buyer interest and a lack of heavy selling pressure. This behavior often precedes major moves, as investors accumulate ahead of expected volatility. Some market participants remain cautious, warning of a possible retrace below the $2,400 level if demand falters or broader risk sentiment weakens. In contrast, bullish analysts like Ted Pillows suggest a more optimistic outlook. According to Pillows, Ethereum is closely following the path Bitcoin took during its 2017–2021 cycle, where tight consolidation ultimately led to a breakout and parabolic rally. In this view, ETH’s real explosive phase won’t begin until it breaks above $4,000. If this scenario plays out, Ethereum could trigger a broader altcoin surge and shift overall crypto market sentiment bullish once again. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% ETH Technical Analysis: Consolidation Near Key Levels The 3-day Ethereum chart shows a prolonged consolidation phase as ETH trades near the $2,500 mark. Despite geopolitical uncertainty and rising macroeconomic risks, Ethereum has held above the $2,400 support zone, forming a tight range just below the critical resistance at $2,775. This area also coincides with the 200-day SMA (red line), which continues to cap upward momentum. ETH remains above the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) SMAs, suggesting bullish momentum is intact, though lacking follow-through. The recent candle bodies show decreasing volatility, with wicks on both sides being absorbed—a classic sign of compression that often precedes a large move. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching – Will History Repeat? Volume has declined slightly compared to the breakout in early May, indicating a temporary pause in bullish conviction. However, if Ethereum manages a higher close above the $2,775 resistance, it could trigger an impulsive breakout targeting the $3,000 level. On the downside, a break below $2,400 would invalidate the current structure and expose ETH to a deeper correction toward $2,100.

2025-06-19T15:21:57,"Only 30% of Russian crypto miners registered, says finance ministry","Most of the crypto miners in Russia don’t comply with the regulations the country imposed on mining. Russia is taking steps to legalize and regulate crypto mining to bring it out of the informal economy. Still, most crypto miners in the country fall outside relevant regulation, authorities say. On Tuesday, June 19, the Finance Ministry revealed that just 30% of miners are registered with the relevant tax authorities. According to Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov, registering crypto mining entities is still an ongoing process. The authorities aim to bring miners into the regulated economy, where they can be taxed and managed. “Our general approach, when we introduced regulation of mining in this industry, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible. We have not yet completed this process. So far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the Federal Tax Service, and this process is still far from complete. Another 2/3 need to be “cleaned up” and entered into the register. Therefore, we will work to complete this process,” Chebeskov said. Still, taxation is not the only reason for registration. Starting in 2025, Russia has banned crypto mining in certain regions with weaker infrastructure, especially during peak hours. The goal is to reduce the strain on electrical grids. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 Russia moves to formalize crypto mining Russia legalized crypto mining in 2023 as part of its ongoing effort to tax and regulate the industry. In 2024, the country imposed a 15% tax on cryptocurrency mining profits, based on market value when received. However, it also lifted some taxes, including VAT on crypto purchases. For Russian citizens and businesses, Bitcoin (BTC) mining remains a profitable way to leverage the country’s cheap energy prices. At the same time, low living standards and ongoing sanctions make it a competitive way for both individuals and companies to earn income.

2025-06-19T15:16:09,"Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Continues! Here is the Latest Data","Institutional interest in U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues. Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong investor interest, recording net inflows of $2.4 billion for the eighth day in a row. Wednesday alone saw inflows of $389.5 million. $2.4 Billion Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 8 Days: Signals of a Slowdown in Ethereum ETFs BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead BlackRock’s IBIT fund led the way with net inflows of $278.9 million on Wednesday alone, while Fidelity’s FBTC fund raised $104.4 million on the same day. Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s BTC Mini, and Hashdex’s DEFI funds saw inflows of $11.3 million, $10.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s high-fee GBTC fund stood out with a single net outflow of $16.4 million. In the 8-day period, 96% of total inflows were made to the IBIT fund, which attracted $2.3 billion in investments during this time. The ETF Store President Nate Geraci emphasized institutional interest by saying, “There has been $11.5 billion inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs so far in 2025. This is the second year. Still no demand?” in a statement on social media platform X. There have been a total of $46.9 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their January 2024 debut, and these funds currently manage approximately $125 billion in assets. On the Ethereum side, there is a calmer picture. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $19.1 million on Wednesday. $15.1 million of this inflow was made to BlackRock’s ETHA fund. The slowdown in flows is notable after the 19-day record inflow streak of $1.4 billion for Ethereum ETFs that ended last week. Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of more than $3.8 billion in the same 19-day period. Total net inflows for Ethereum ETFs currently sit at $3.9 billion. BRN Research Analyst Valentin Fournier commented on the slowdown in institutional interest in Ethereum: “Data suggests institutions maintain a bullish medium-term perspective on crypto, but the catch-up phase in Ethereum appears to be over.” Macro Uncertainties Pressure Market Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,810, down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and 2.5% in the last week, while Ethereum is down 8.3% to $2,527 in the same period. The FOMC was expected to keep interest rates unchanged, but the statement took a more hawkish tone. “Bitcoin is holding above $100,000 but has failed to break resistance levels. A retest of $102,000 support looks likely,” Fournier said. The Long-Term Investment Story is Getting Stronger 21Shares Crypto Investments Expert David Hernandez drew a more optimistic picture: “As confidence in soft landings wanes and global financial imbalances rise, Bitcoin’s scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality make it an increasingly attractive asset for investors grappling with uncertainty.” “Bitcoin has established a permanent foothold above the $100,000 level. Its resilience to geopolitical shocks further solidifies its place in the investment world.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T15:05:18,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Nears Inflection Point, What’s Next?","XRP continues to trade within a tight consolidation range while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate recent market headlines. Despite lacking strong bullish momentum, XRP’s price action shows resilience, holding key support zones across both USDT and BTC pairs. However, both charts suggest that the asset is nearing critical inflection points, where a breakdown or breakout could define the next major move. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRP/USDT remains compressed within a long-term descending channel pattern, bounded by a descending trendline from the yearly highs and a horizontal support near $1.95, with tons of sell-side liquidity resting under it. The pair is currently trading around $2.15, just under both the 100 and 200 moving averages. The RSI is also hovering near 44, indicating the lack of momentum and confirming the range-bound behavior. The asset is currently coiling just above the highlighted liquidity level, suggesting that if sellers manage to breach $1.95, the next logical demand zone lies around $1.6. Meanwhile, upside resistance remains at the upper bound of the channel near $2.60, which has rejected multiple attempts in recent weeks. A clean break and daily close above that trendline would potentially confirm a bullish rally, with the target being around $3. Until then, this is still a neutral structure favoring range traders rather than trend-followers. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP has shown persistent weakness since March, consistently printing lower highs and lower lows. The chart highlights a large descending wedge formation, with price now moving toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Both the 100 and 200 moving averages are angled downward after a bearish crossover, and the RSI is still depressed near 42, reflecting ongoing relative underperformance. That said, the pair is approaching the imbalance zone (FVG) left from the explosive rally in late 2024. This pocket, located just below 1900 SAT, could act as a magnet for price while also offering potential for a relief bounce. If the buyers step in, the first challenge lies near the higher trendline of the wedge around 2200 SAT, which coincides with a horizontal resistance level. A decisive move above that level could shift short-term momentum, but unless that happens, the pair remains locked in a clear bearish structure.

While some major altcoins show mixed performance, the overall pattern points to a potential major rally ahead. After a massive, four-year consolidation period, the altcoin market may be entering a “final shakeout” phase before a significant and sustained breakout, according to a growing number of technical analysts.

2025-06-19T15:00:00,"Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Tax Preparation","In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Bryan Courchesne from DAIM provides information on tax planning for crypto trades. Although we are half a year away from tax season, there are many considerations to track in order to be tax-ready. Then, Saim Akif from Akif CPA breaks down the differences in tax treatment between crypto and equities/bonds in Ask an Expert. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Taxes Are Complicated, Don’t Let Them Derail Your Portfolio As advisors focused on crypto, we’re familiar with the unique tax situations this asset class presents. For example, crypto is not subject to wash-sale rules, which allows for more efficient tax-loss harvesting. It also enables direct asset swaps, such as converting bitcoin (BTC) to ether (ETH) or ETH to Solana (SOL), without first selling into cash. These are just a couple of features that set crypto apart from traditional investments. However, perhaps the most important thing for investors to consider is the sheer number of platforms they may use and how challenging it can be to track everything at tax time. Tracking your crypto taxes isn’t just a year-end chore; it’s a year-round challenge, especially if you’re active on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Every trade, swap, airdrop, staking reward, or bridging event can be a taxable event. Centralized Exchange Trading When using CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you may receive year-end tax summaries, but those are often incomplete or inconsistent across platforms. One major challenge is tracking your cost basis across exchanges. For example, if you buy Amazon stock in a Fidelity account and transfer it to Schwab, your cost basis transfers seamlessly and updates with each new trade. At tax time, Schwab can generate an accurate 1099 showing your gains and losses. But in crypto, if you transfer assets from Kraken to Coinbase, your cost basis doesn’t automatically transfer with them. If you’re moving assets across multiple platforms, you’ll need to manually track every transaction, or you’ll face a major headache when filing taxes. Decentralized Exchange Trading Things get even more complicated when using DEXs. Apps like Coinbase Wallet (not to be confused with the Coinbase exchange) or Phantom connect you to decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter. These DEXs don’t issue tax forms or track your cost basis, so it’s entirely up to you to log and reconcile every transaction. Miss a single token swap or forget to record the fair market value of a liquidity pool withdrawal, and your tax report could be inaccurate. That could trigger IRS scrutiny or lead to missed deductions. While some apps can calculate gains and losses from a single wallet address, they often struggle when assets are transferred between addresses, making them less useful for active users. And here’s the kicker: if you’re actively trading on DEXs, chances are you’re not even making money. But even losses must be reported correctly to qualify for a deduction. If not, you risk losing the write-off or, worse, facing an audit. Unless you’re a full-time crypto trader, the time and effort required to track every transaction isn’t just stressful, it can cost you real money. What steps can I take to make sure I'm tax ready? There are, however, several ways to prepare properly for crypto taxes: Use crypto tax software from the beginning. Even then, you’ll want to double-check that the reported activity makes sense and adjust as needed. Hire a crypto tax specialist or work with a crypto-focused advisor who understands the landscape. Download all transaction logs and see if your CPA or advisor can help build a cost basis and determine your realized gains and losses. As adoption increases, tax reporting will undoubtedly evolve — in the meantime keeping track of your trade activity is important to be ready for tax season. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. Why are advisors watching crypto closely? A. Institutional crypto inflows have surged to $35 billion . While crypto is more volatile than traditional assets, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have historically outperformed other traditional asset classes since 2012. Q. How is crypto being treated differently from equities/bonds from a tax side? A. Crypto differs fundamentally from equities and bonds. Advisors must track each wallet separately for cost basis (starting Jan 2025). Unlike traditional 1099s, clients often get little to no reporting support from exchanges, especially for self-custodied assets. Q. Do you have any special insights for CPAs and tax advisors? A. Compliance isn’t optional anymore. Starting with 2025 returns: Wallet-level cost basis reporting is mandatory. IRS Form 1099-DA will begin showing up in 2026. Exchanges often don’t support reporting for self-custodied assets.

2025-06-19T14:55:26,"Elon Musk’s X targets stock and crypto trading features in major expansion","Elon Musk’s app X (formerly Twitter) will soon let people trade crypto and stocks straight from their accounts, without ever leaving the platform. That’s the latest update from Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, who said the company is building out full financial tools for users to control everything from payments to investing. The comments came during an interview with the Financial Times at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, where she explained how this new plan fits into Elon’s larger plan to turn X into an “everything app.” “You’ll be able to come to X and be able to transact your whole financial life on the platform,” Linda said, speaking directly about the new investment features. “And that’s whether I can pay you for the pizza that we shared last night or make an investment or a trade. So that’s the future.” This expansion will allow people to pay for goods, tip creators, and make trades on the same platform they already use for content. X plans US rollout of X Money and financial tools X is rolling out its financial services in stages. First up is X Money, a new digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment system that will launch in the United States before expanding to other countries. Linda said X Money will support functions like tipping, saving, and buying things directly in the app. X is also partnering with Visa to back the payment system and plans to add an X-branded credit or debit card as early as this year. Elon bought the company, then called Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. Since then, he’s tried to turn it into a catch-all platform modeled after WeChat, the Chinese app that blends messaging, social media, shopping, and finance. Linda said this new expansion isn’t just about payments. She said: “A whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem is going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today.” But adding financial tools means X has to face regulatory challenges. Services like stock trading, crypto transfers, and payments come with licensing issues, money laundering laws, and compliance requirements that are far stricter than anything the company has dealt with before. That hasn’t stopped Elon from pushing forward. At the same time, X is still trying to fix its ad revenue problem. After Elon’s takeover, most of the platform’s advertisers pulled out, saying they didn’t want their brands next to toxic content or political chaos. Revenue dropped from $4.1 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion last year, but research firm Emarketer projects it might climb to $2.3 billion in 2025. X battles with advertisers while pushing AI tie-in X has also been accused of pressuring brands to come back. The Wall Street Journal reported that companies like Verizon and Ralph Lauren agreed to buy ads after allegedly being threatened with legal action. Linda denied that and said, “It’s unnamed sources, random third-party commenters.” She called the claims “hearsay” and said X never forced anyone to spend money. To make matters worse, some advertisers at Cannes said they’re still not confident in the platform. One person claimed they were told they had to hit a spending threshold or face a lawsuit. Another said Elon’s close ties with President Donald Trump made them uneasy about saying no to ad deals. X is already suing the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, a group of brands and ad agencies, for organizing what it says was an illegal boycott under the pretense of “online safety.” That lawsuit, filed last summer, accuses them of breaking competition laws. Since then, the company has removed and added brands from the complaint. It dropped Unilever after the company started buying ads again in October. Still, Linda told advertisers that 96% of pre-acquisition clients are now back. She claimed X is close to recovering its full ad business from 2022. But the people on the ground aren’t fully convinced. Some said they still think the platform is too unpredictable. Others think the content’s still too toxic.

The self-described gold bug argued that poor people focus on the price while the rich focus on the quantity of the asset they continue to hold. Although he noted that prices are important, Kiyosaki stressed investors need to prioritize the quantity of Bitcoin, gold, or silver that they own. “While price is important….the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin…The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices,” he said. Kiyosaki further revealed that he acquired his first Bitcoin when the crypto was valued at $6,000 and has not looked back since then. While he did not divulge more information on the amount he currently holds, the famed author wished he had more “fake money” to buy more of the premier crypto. Kiyosaki has long contended that safe haven assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin are essential hedges against inflation and important for long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. Analysts Eye $1 Million BTC By 2030 Kiyosaki is not the only industry figure foreseeing a seven-figure Bitcoin price tag by 2030. In May 2024, Twitter (now X) co-founder Jack Dorsey said a single BTC would be worth $1 million by 2030 and could appreciate more. While delivering a speech in December at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million owing to its scarcity.

2025-06-19T14:45:36,"Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why","The post Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Australia is known for its crypto-friendly environment , but recent legal developments may completely change how Bitcoin is taxed in the country. Bitcoin Reclassification: Major Legal Update In May 2025 , a significant ruling by Victorian Magistrate Michael O’Connell in a Bitcoin theft case suggested that Bitcoin could be recognized as Australian currency , not property. This landmark statement has sparked intense debate across the crypto community and tax authorities. Adrian Carter, a co-defendant in the case, said: “It was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences.” If Bitcoin is officially reclassified as currency, this could eliminate capital gains tax (CGT) on BTC transactions and result in the government owing nearly AUS$1 billion (approx. US$640 million) in past tax collections. Is Bitcoin Really Tax-Free Now? Not yet. The ruling is under appeal and has not been officially regulated . While the decision received attention, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has not updated its guidance . Until higher courts confirm Bitcoin as legal tender, the existing tax framework remains in place. Current Crypto Tax Regime in Australia (2025) Cryptos including BTC, ETH, NFTs, stablecoins, and DeFi are classified as CGT assets . Subject to Capital Gains Tax between 0% and 40% , based on individual income brackets. A 50% CGT discount applies if assets are held for over 12 months before being sold. The ATO tracks all crypto activity, and non-compliance can lead to legal penalties . Any Tax Loopholes for Crypto Investors? Despite rumors, there are no loopholes in the current regime. Even if investors hope for CGT exemptions, the law remains unchanged until Bitcoin is officially recognized as currency by a higher court and accepted by the ATO. Final Thoughts Unless Bitcoin is formally reclassified, Australian investors and businesses must follow the existing crypto tax rules . The ATO continues to treat digital assets as property, not money, and capital gains tax still applies to all crypto-related transactions.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-in-australia-may-end-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

The more the Bitcoin price traverses sideways, the further upwards the price is likely to climb once a breakout takes place. $BTC ranging for a month Source: TradingView The $BTC price has been ranging sideways for a good month now. Since breaking back above $102,000, the price has been up to make the all-time high, has meandered back down to make a low at $100,400, and is currently moving inside a wedge pattern that could break one way or the other. In favour of the bulls, the Stochastic RSIs for the short to medium term time frames have their indicators at the bottom. As can be seen in the chart above, the 4-hour indicators are just making their way up, so perhaps price may start rising. $BTC bouncing from 0.618 Fibonacci Source: TradingView Moving into the daily time frame it can be seen that a series of lower highs is starting to converge with a series of higher lows. It can also be noted that the 0.618 Fibonacci level is playing an important role. Since the big dip down to just above $100,000, the price has been respecting the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $104,300. If the price can now bounce from here, a breakout of the top trendline could be the result. In addition, if the price breaks down, things wouldn’t necessarily be that bad for the bulls, as more sideways price action could take place. Weekly chart shows potential bounce from good support structure Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the potential lift-off point for Bitcoin. The support lines are drawn across from the last time weekly candle bodies made their tops at $102,000 and $104,000. If the price can stay above the $104,400 level at this coming weekly close, there is a good chance of a bounce, and at the very least more sideways price action that would act to build more price structure above this level and make it very strong support.

2025-06-19T14:44:02,"Ohio’s House of Representatives Passes Crypto Bill to Allow $200 Tax Free Threshold for Crypto Transactions","Ohio’s House of Representatives has passed a bill that incentivises crypto use, such as mining and staking activities, and exempts crypto transactions from capital gains tax. If passed by the Senate, the new laws would exempt crypto transactions that fall below a $200 threshold from requiring capital gains tax. The threshold exemption would encourage using Bitcoin as a form of money. If passed by the Senate, the new laws in Ohio may provide some headway in allowing consumers to use cryptocurrencies as currencies for everyday purchases. The new legislation, House Bill 116, passed with a vote of 70-26. Lawmakers titled the bill the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. House Bill 116 now has to pass the Senate and then, if passed, has to be signed off by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. The bill has been promoted mainly by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, who argues that it will make it easier for consumers to use crypto and protect the crypto mining industry from excessive government overreach. Steve Demetriou, House Representative, sponsored the bill in February, allowing the bill to pass the House Technology and Innovation Committee with a vote of 13-0. The bill has now passed the House of Representatives and has a chance to be signed into law. The bill was passed just a day after the Genius Act passed the Senate at the federal level. The Genius Act provides provisions for the stablecoin market to dispel uncertainty for token issuers and provide consumer protections. Demetriou said the new bill allowed Ohio to show the world that it is ready to embrace the new economy and use digital assets. Demetriou further stated that the legislation will enable the growth of blockchain innovations in Ohio. The Republican Representative said he aimed to sponsor common-sense legislation for a technologically advanced innovation. Ohio plans to attract crypto entrepreneurs to the state, enticing them with incentives to bring their assets and capital with them, enriching the state with a wealth of resources that other states have rejected. Time will tell whether such an incentive-based approach to regulation and tax will benefit the local economy. Other states may follow suit if the regulatory incentives prove to be successful. House Bill 116 is quite a unique piece of legislation because it proposes a $200 threshold for tax-free use of cryptocurrencies. The bill is a simple but targeted approach to legislation. This is most likely what Demetriou meant when he said he wanted to sponsor a common-sense bill. The tax incentives aim to lower the burden on consumers so they can feel free to spend their crypto without worrying about reporting every transaction. Crypto mining operations were also featured in the bill. Crypto miners will be allowed to operate mining rigs in residential areas if they adhere to noise restrictions and respect their neighbours. Industrial areas will also be allowed to host mining operations. The bill made specific provisions that protect crypto miners from land rezoning. The bill will ban rezoning projects that affect crypto mining businesses. Crypto miners will be subject to laws that affect similar companies in the state. Miners will be able to dispute any grievances that they face. The bill aims to treat crypto mining like a regular business without creating unnecessary laws for the crypto industry. House Bill 116 comes as other crypto bills are introduced in Ohio. Both the state and federal levels of the American government are debating rules that apply to the crypto industry. Ohio has also proposed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill allowing the state to invest public funds into Bitcoin. New Hampshire and Arizona have already set a precedent in passing Bitcoin Treasury laws. At the federal level, an ongoing effort is still to pass President Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law. The new rules would allow the US government to redirect seized Bitcoin from criminal proceedings to create a fund for future use. The states of Texas, Florida, and Montana are still seeking laws for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve of their own. Other states may reassess the viability of a reserve treasury if other states successfully implement their own strategies. As a federal politician, Tim Burchett has been essential to implementing President Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve into law. An alignment of state and federal legislation would give blockchain companies a large boost to focus on their businesses and worry less about legislation. Consumers will also benefit from such an alignment because they will have more options to spend and save their cryptocurrencies without feeling the burden of draconian tax requirements.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ohios-house-of-representatives-passes-crypto-bill-to-allow-200-tax-free-threshold-for-crypto-transactions/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T14:40:09,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings In the ever-evolving landscape of corporate finance and investment, a notable trend continues to gain momentum: the strategic acquisition of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. This isn’t just about speculative trading; for many companies, it’s becoming a core component of their long-term treasury and growth strategies. The latest example comes from London-listed technology firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC) , which recently announced a significant boost to its Bitcoin reserves. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? SWC’s move isn’t happening in a vacuum. A growing number of publicly traded and private companies are allocating portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. But why? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its capped supply compared to fiat currencies. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, similar to gold, but with greater portability and divisibility. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify corporate treasuries away from traditional assets like cash and bonds. Alignment with Future Trends: Investing in Bitcoin signals a forward-thinking approach and alignment with the burgeoning digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential. This strategic shift reflects a growing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. The Smarter Web Company ‘s Latest Move: A Closer Look The Smarter Web Company took to the social media platform X to share news of its recent Bitcoin acquisition. The company added an additional 104.28 BTC to its holdings. This isn’t a one-off purchase but part of a clearly defined, multi-year initiative known as “The 10 Year Plan.” This plan underscores SWC’s commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy over the long term. The acquisition of 104.28 BTC represents a substantial addition to their existing reserves. This specific amount was likely chosen based on market conditions, available capital, and the parameters set within their strategic plan. Growing Their Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this latest purchase, The Smarter Web Company ‘s total corporate Bitcoin holdings have increased significantly. The company now holds a cumulative total of 346.63 BTC. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the change: Holding Metric Previous Total Acquisition Amount New Total Total BTC Held Approx. 242.35 BTC 104.28 BTC 346.63 BTC This increase of over 40% in their Bitcoin reserves highlights the company’s increasing conviction in the role of digital assets within its financial framework. While 346.63 BTC might seem modest compared to some of the largest corporate holders like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it represents a significant commitment for a London-listed technology firm and positions them among a growing list of public companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. Understanding SWC’s Digital Asset Strategy : The 10 Year Plan The mention of “The 10 Year Plan” is crucial. This indicates that SWC’s foray into Bitcoin is not a short-term speculative play but a foundational element of their long-term financial and strategic vision. A digital asset strategy of this duration suggests several potential objectives: Long-Term Value Accumulation: Believing in Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly over a decade. Balance Sheet Resilience: Using Bitcoin to strengthen the balance sheet against economic uncertainties. Pioneering in the Tech Sector: Positioning SWC as an innovator and early adopter within the technology industry regarding digital finance. Potential Future Use Cases: Exploring how digital assets might integrate into their business operations or service offerings over time. Such a long-term outlook suggests a careful analysis of Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market cycles, and its potential role in the global economy. It moves beyond simple treasury management into a more strategic alignment with the future of finance and technology. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for SWC and the Market? SWC’s decision to increase its corporate Bitcoin holdings sends several signals: Confidence in Bitcoin: It demonstrates continued confidence in Bitcoin’s viability and potential despite market volatility. Execution of Strategy: It shows the company is actively executing its stated “The 10 Year Plan” regarding digital assets. Potential Influence: While not a market-moving amount on its own, it contributes to the broader trend of institutional adoption, which collectively impacts market sentiment and liquidity. Shareholder Signal: It signals to investors that SWC views digital assets as a valuable component of its future growth and stability. For the broader market, every public company announcing a Bitcoin purchase adds another data point to the narrative of institutional acceptance. This cumulative effect can bolster confidence among other potential corporate investors and retail participants alike. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are clear to companies like SWC, holding Bitcoin isn’t without its challenges. These include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Protecting large sums of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols and expertise. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may still be skeptical about digital assets. Companies pursuing a digital asset strategy must carefully navigate these challenges, implementing strong risk management frameworks and transparent communication with stakeholders. Examples of Other Companies with Significant Corporate Bitcoin Holdings SWC joins a growing list. The most prominent examples include: MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, viewing it as their primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla: Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Marathon Digital Holdings & Riot Platforms: These Bitcoin mining companies hold substantial amounts of BTC mined from their operations. Coinbase: As a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s natural for them to hold Bitcoin as part of their operations and investments. These examples, spanning different sectors, illustrate the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. SWC’s move reinforces this trend within the technology sector. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Watchers What can we learn from SWC’s recent Bitcoin acquisition ? Track Corporate Adoption: Pay attention to announcements from public companies regarding digital asset holdings. This trend is a significant indicator of market maturity. Understand the Strategy: Look beyond the headline number. Is it part of a stated long-term strategy like SWC’s “The 10 Year Plan”? This suggests a more fundamental belief in the asset. Assess Company Fundamentals: Evaluate the company’s core business alongside its digital asset strategy. The Bitcoin holdings are part of the larger financial picture. Consider the Sector: Technology companies are often at the forefront of adopting new financial technologies. SWC’s move aligns with this pattern. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset adoption is dynamic. Follow news and analysis from reputable sources. SWC’s action provides valuable insight into how companies are increasingly viewing and utilizing digital assets as part of their strategic financial planning. Conclusion: SWC Doubles Down on its Digital Asset Strategy The Smarter Web Company’s acquisition of an additional 104.28 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of their long-term commitment to digital assets as outlined in “The 10 Year Plan.” By increasing their corporate Bitcoin holdings to 346.63 BTC, SWC joins a growing cohort of companies that see strategic value in having Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This Bitcoin acquisition highlights the ongoing trend of institutional adoption and signals a forward-looking approach to finance and technology within The Smarter Web Company .

The current pattern is similar to Bitcoin’s price action following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2023, both of which triggered short-term sell-offs before price stabilization. Grayscale Lags Behind as Rivals Attract Capital While most of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed growing investor interest, Grayscale’s products continued to see capital outflows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) lost $16.4 million, and its recently introduced low-fee product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, saw $10.1 million in outflows. Despite early-year sluggishness, total inflows across all 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have surged to $11.2 billion since April 17. Altogether, the funds have attracted over $46.3 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity leading at $50.6 billion and $11.5 billion in total assets under management. Notably, this figure includes more than $23.2 billion in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC. Ether ETFs Regain Momentum Amid Regulatory Clarity Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. also showed signs of strength, posting three consecutive days of net inflows from June 16 to 18 after a brief pause. On Wednesday alone, the products saw over $19.1 million in new capital. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to lead among Ether funds, maintaining an inflow streak on every trading day except two since May 20. Industry analysts say renewed confidence in Ether ETFs stems from the SEC’s recent clarification that protocol-level staking does not constitute a securities transaction.

2025-06-19T14:30:21,"Institutional Investors Dump $50,780,000,000 in Stocks in Just One Month Amid US Bond Rating Downgrade and Trump Trade War: S&P Global","Institutional investors dumped a net $50.78 billion worth of stocks in May, according to market intelligence from S&P Global. That number surpassed the net $30.93 billion worth of stocks that were unloaded by institutions in April and is above the net monthly average in the past year of $42.73 billion. S&P Global notes that institutions dumped equities in May due to trade concerns and Moody’s decision to downgrade the United States’ credit rating from AAA to AA1. Explains Thomas McNamara, an S&P Global director of market intelligence, “Institutions still don’t feel that we are out of the woods in relation to tariffs, recession and overall global uncertainty.” Source: S&P Global/X Conversely, index and exchange-traded fund investors gobbled up a net $11.07 billion in stocks last month and $14.46 billion in April. Both of those numbers are significantly less than the 12-month average of $29.44 billion, however. McNamara says it is “never zero-sum” in terms of stock sales. “There are a lot of factors that go into this on a general basis, but this month, a main driver was share buybacks. This may also be a reason why the market rebounded like it did without any long-only conviction.” The S&P 500 is up 0.25% in the past month, and the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 1.6%, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by nearly 1.4%.
