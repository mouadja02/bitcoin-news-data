2025-06-19T14:48:43,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Calls For $1 Million BTC By 2030","Financial educator, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and investor Robert Kiyosaki recently predicted a $1 million Bitcoin price by 2030. “In 2030, the probability is Bitcoin will be $1 million a coin,” Kiyosaki said in a June 18 post on X. The self-described gold bug argued that poor people focus on the price while the rich focus on the quantity of the asset they continue to hold. Although he noted that prices are important, Kiyosaki stressed investors need to prioritize the quantity of Bitcoin, gold, or silver that they own. “While price is important….the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin…The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices,” he said. Kiyosaki further revealed that he acquired his first Bitcoin when the crypto was valued at $6,000 and has not looked back since then. While he did not divulge more information on the amount he currently holds, the famed author wished he had more “fake money” to buy more of the premier crypto. Kiyosaki has long contended that safe haven assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin are essential hedges against inflation and important for long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. Analysts Eye $1 Million BTC By 2030 Kiyosaki is not the only industry figure foreseeing a seven-figure Bitcoin price tag by 2030. In May 2024, Twitter (now X) co-founder Jack Dorsey said a single BTC would be worth $1 million by 2030 and could appreciate more. While delivering a speech in December at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million owing to its scarcity. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is even more optimistic on Bitcoin’s price prospects. In an April report, the investment manager increased its bull-case Bitcoin price target to as high as $2.4 million by the end of this decade.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-calls-for-1-million-btc-by-2030/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTG","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T14:45:36,"Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why","The post Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Australia is known for its crypto-friendly environment , but recent legal developments may completely change how Bitcoin is taxed in the country. Bitcoin Reclassification: Major Legal Update In May 2025 , a significant ruling by Victorian Magistrate Michael O’Connell in a Bitcoin theft case suggested that Bitcoin could be recognized as Australian currency , not property. This landmark statement has sparked intense debate across the crypto community and tax authorities. Adrian Carter, a co-defendant in the case, said: “It was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences.” If Bitcoin is officially reclassified as currency, this could eliminate capital gains tax (CGT) on BTC transactions and result in the government owing nearly AUS$1 billion (approx. US$640 million) in past tax collections. Is Bitcoin Really Tax-Free Now? Not yet. The ruling is under appeal and has not been officially regulated . While the decision received attention, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has not updated its guidance . Until higher courts confirm Bitcoin as legal tender, the existing tax framework remains in place. Current Crypto Tax Regime in Australia (2025) Cryptos including BTC, ETH, NFTs, stablecoins, and DeFi are classified as CGT assets . Subject to Capital Gains Tax between 0% and 40% , based on individual income brackets. A 50% CGT discount applies if assets are held for over 12 months before being sold. The ATO tracks all crypto activity, and non-compliance can lead to legal penalties . Any Tax Loopholes for Crypto Investors? Despite rumors, there are no loopholes in the current regime. Even if investors hope for CGT exemptions, the law remains unchanged until Bitcoin is officially recognized as currency by a higher court and accepted by the ATO. Final Thoughts Unless Bitcoin is formally reclassified, Australian investors and businesses must follow the existing crypto tax rules . The ATO continues to treat digital assets as property, not money, and capital gains tax still applies to all crypto-related transactions.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-in-australia-may-end-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T14:44:56,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge Awaits: Why Lift-Off Is Imminent","After hitting the all-time high of $112,000 a few weeks of sideways price action was not only likely to happen, it is also a good sign of a healthy bull market. The more the Bitcoin price traverses sideways, the further upwards the price is likely to climb once a breakout takes place. $BTC ranging for a month Source: TradingView The $BTC price has been ranging sideways for a good month now. Since breaking back above $102,000, the price has been up to make the all-time high, has meandered back down to make a low at $100,400, and is currently moving inside a wedge pattern that could break one way or the other. In favour of the bulls, the Stochastic RSIs for the short to medium term time frames have their indicators at the bottom. As can be seen in the chart above, the 4-hour indicators are just making their way up, so perhaps price may start rising. $BTC bouncing from 0.618 Fibonacci Source: TradingView Moving into the daily time frame it can be seen that a series of lower highs is starting to converge with a series of higher lows. It can also be noted that the 0.618 Fibonacci level is playing an important role. Since the big dip down to just above $100,000, the price has been respecting the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $104,300. If the price can now bounce from here, a breakout of the top trendline could be the result. In addition, if the price breaks down, things wouldn’t necessarily be that bad for the bulls, as more sideways price action could take place. Weekly chart shows potential bounce from good support structure Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the potential lift-off point for Bitcoin. The support lines are drawn across from the last time weekly candle bodies made their tops at $102,000 and $104,000. If the price can stay above the $104,400 level at this coming weekly close, there is a good chance of a bounce, and at the very least more sideways price action that would act to build more price structure above this level and make it very strong support.

2025-06-19T14:44:02,"Ohio’s House of Representatives Passes Crypto Bill to Allow $200 Tax Free Threshold for Crypto Transactions","Ohio’s House of Representatives has passed a bill that incentivises crypto use, such as mining and staking activities, and exempts crypto transactions from capital gains tax. If passed by the Senate, the new laws would exempt crypto transactions that fall below a $200 threshold from requiring capital gains tax. The threshold exemption would encourage using Bitcoin as a form of money. If passed by the Senate, the new laws in Ohio may provide some headway in allowing consumers to use cryptocurrencies as currencies for everyday purchases. The new legislation, House Bill 116, passed with a vote of 70-26. Lawmakers titled the bill the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. House Bill 116 now has to pass the Senate and then, if passed, has to be signed off by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. The bill has been promoted mainly by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, who argues that it will make it easier for consumers to use crypto and protect the crypto mining industry from excessive government overreach. Steve Demetriou, House Representative, sponsored the bill in February, allowing the bill to pass the House Technology and Innovation Committee with a vote of 13-0. The bill has now passed the House of Representatives and has a chance to be signed into law. The bill was passed just a day after the Genius Act passed the Senate at the federal level. The Genius Act provides provisions for the stablecoin market to dispel uncertainty for token issuers and provide consumer protections. Demetriou said the new bill allowed Ohio to show the world that it is ready to embrace the new economy and use digital assets. Demetriou further stated that the legislation will enable the growth of blockchain innovations in Ohio. The Republican Representative said he aimed to sponsor common-sense legislation for a technologically advanced innovation. Ohio plans to attract crypto entrepreneurs to the state, enticing them with incentives to bring their assets and capital with them, enriching the state with a wealth of resources that other states have rejected. Time will tell whether such an incentive-based approach to regulation and tax will benefit the local economy. Other states may follow suit if the regulatory incentives prove to be successful. House Bill 116 is quite a unique piece of legislation because it proposes a $200 threshold for tax-free use of cryptocurrencies. The bill is a simple but targeted approach to legislation. This is most likely what Demetriou meant when he said he wanted to sponsor a common-sense bill. The tax incentives aim to lower the burden on consumers so they can feel free to spend their crypto without worrying about reporting every transaction. Crypto mining operations were also featured in the bill. Crypto miners will be allowed to operate mining rigs in residential areas if they adhere to noise restrictions and respect their neighbours. Industrial areas will also be allowed to host mining operations. The bill made specific provisions that protect crypto miners from land rezoning. The bill will ban rezoning projects that affect crypto mining businesses. Crypto miners will be subject to laws that affect similar companies in the state. Miners will be able to dispute any grievances that they face. The bill aims to treat crypto mining like a regular business without creating unnecessary laws for the crypto industry. House Bill 116 comes as other crypto bills are introduced in Ohio. Both the state and federal levels of the American government are debating rules that apply to the crypto industry. Ohio has also proposed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill allowing the state to invest public funds into Bitcoin. New Hampshire and Arizona have already set a precedent in passing Bitcoin Treasury laws. At the federal level, an ongoing effort is still to pass President Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law. The new rules would allow the US government to redirect seized Bitcoin from criminal proceedings to create a fund for future use. The states of Texas, Florida, and Montana are still seeking laws for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve of their own. Other states may reassess the viability of a reserve treasury if other states successfully implement their own strategies. As a federal politician, Tim Burchett has been essential to implementing President Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve into law. An alignment of state and federal legislation would give blockchain companies a large boost to focus on their businesses and worry less about legislation. Consumers will also benefit from such an alignment because they will have more options to spend and save their cryptocurrencies without feeling the burden of draconian tax requirements.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ohios-house-of-representatives-passes-crypto-bill-to-allow-200-tax-free-threshold-for-crypto-transactions/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T14:40:09,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings In the ever-evolving landscape of corporate finance and investment, a notable trend continues to gain momentum: the strategic acquisition of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. This isn’t just about speculative trading; for many companies, it’s becoming a core component of their long-term treasury and growth strategies. The latest example comes from London-listed technology firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC) , which recently announced a significant boost to its Bitcoin reserves. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? SWC’s move isn’t happening in a vacuum. A growing number of publicly traded and private companies are allocating portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. But why? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its capped supply compared to fiat currencies. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, similar to gold, but with greater portability and divisibility. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify corporate treasuries away from traditional assets like cash and bonds. Alignment with Future Trends: Investing in Bitcoin signals a forward-thinking approach and alignment with the burgeoning digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential. This strategic shift reflects a growing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. The Smarter Web Company ‘s Latest Move: A Closer Look The Smarter Web Company took to the social media platform X to share news of its recent Bitcoin acquisition. The company added an additional 104.28 BTC to its holdings. This isn’t a one-off purchase but part of a clearly defined, multi-year initiative known as “The 10 Year Plan.” This plan underscores SWC’s commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy over the long term. The acquisition of 104.28 BTC represents a substantial addition to their existing reserves. This specific amount was likely chosen based on market conditions, available capital, and the parameters set within their strategic plan. Growing Their Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this latest purchase, The Smarter Web Company ‘s total corporate Bitcoin holdings have increased significantly. The company now holds a cumulative total of 346.63 BTC. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the change: Holding Metric Previous Total Acquisition Amount New Total Total BTC Held Approx. 242.35 BTC 104.28 BTC 346.63 BTC This increase of over 40% in their Bitcoin reserves highlights the company’s increasing conviction in the role of digital assets within its financial framework. While 346.63 BTC might seem modest compared to some of the largest corporate holders like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it represents a significant commitment for a London-listed technology firm and positions them among a growing list of public companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. Understanding SWC’s Digital Asset Strategy : The 10 Year Plan The mention of “The 10 Year Plan” is crucial. This indicates that SWC’s foray into Bitcoin is not a short-term speculative play but a foundational element of their long-term financial and strategic vision. A digital asset strategy of this duration suggests several potential objectives: Long-Term Value Accumulation: Believing in Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly over a decade. Balance Sheet Resilience: Using Bitcoin to strengthen the balance sheet against economic uncertainties. Pioneering in the Tech Sector: Positioning SWC as an innovator and early adopter within the technology industry regarding digital finance. Potential Future Use Cases: Exploring how digital assets might integrate into their business operations or service offerings over time. Such a long-term outlook suggests a careful analysis of Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market cycles, and its potential role in the global economy. It moves beyond simple treasury management into a more strategic alignment with the future of finance and technology. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for SWC and the Market? SWC’s decision to increase its corporate Bitcoin holdings sends several signals: Confidence in Bitcoin: It demonstrates continued confidence in Bitcoin’s viability and potential despite market volatility. Execution of Strategy: It shows the company is actively executing its stated “The 10 Year Plan” regarding digital assets. Potential Influence: While not a market-moving amount on its own, it contributes to the broader trend of institutional adoption, which collectively impacts market sentiment and liquidity. Shareholder Signal: It signals to investors that SWC views digital assets as a valuable component of its future growth and stability. For the broader market, every public company announcing a Bitcoin purchase adds another data point to the narrative of institutional acceptance. This cumulative effect can bolster confidence among other potential corporate investors and retail participants alike. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are clear to companies like SWC, holding Bitcoin isn’t without its challenges. These include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Protecting large sums of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols and expertise. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may still be skeptical about digital assets. Companies pursuing a digital asset strategy must carefully navigate these challenges, implementing strong risk management frameworks and transparent communication with stakeholders. Examples of Other Companies with Significant Corporate Bitcoin Holdings SWC joins a growing list. The most prominent examples include: MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, viewing it as their primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla: Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Marathon Digital Holdings & Riot Platforms: These Bitcoin mining companies hold substantial amounts of BTC mined from their operations. Coinbase: As a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s natural for them to hold Bitcoin as part of their operations and investments. These examples, spanning different sectors, illustrate the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. SWC’s move reinforces this trend within the technology sector. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Watchers What can we learn from SWC’s recent Bitcoin acquisition ? Track Corporate Adoption: Pay attention to announcements from public companies regarding digital asset holdings. This trend is a significant indicator of market maturity. Understand the Strategy: Look beyond the headline number. Is it part of a stated long-term strategy like SWC’s “The 10 Year Plan”? This suggests a more fundamental belief in the asset. Assess Company Fundamentals: Evaluate the company’s core business alongside its digital asset strategy. The Bitcoin holdings are part of the larger financial picture. Consider the Sector: Technology companies are often at the forefront of adopting new financial technologies. SWC’s move aligns with this pattern. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset adoption is dynamic. Follow news and analysis from reputable sources. SWC’s action provides valuable insight into how companies are increasingly viewing and utilizing digital assets as part of their strategic financial planning. Conclusion: SWC Doubles Down on its Digital Asset Strategy The Smarter Web Company’s acquisition of an additional 104.28 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of their long-term commitment to digital assets as outlined in “The 10 Year Plan.” By increasing their corporate Bitcoin holdings to 346.63 BTC, SWC joins a growing cohort of companies that see strategic value in having Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This Bitcoin acquisition highlights the ongoing trend of institutional adoption and signals a forward-looking approach to finance and technology within The Smarter Web Company .

2025-06-19T14:35:52,"Bitcoin ETFs Log $388M in Daily Inflows Despite Geopolitical Tensions","U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $388.3 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking eight consecutive days of investor confidence despite market jitters stemming from renewed tensions between Israel and Iran . The surge in capital underscores the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as it continues to stabilize in the face of global uncertainty. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the charge, attracting $278.9 million and $104.4 million, respectively, according to data from Farside Investors. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) also contributed $11.3 million in inflows, while other prominent funds, including those by ARK Invest, Invesco, and VanEck, recorded no new capital on the day. Crypto analytics platform Santiment noted that Bitcoin’s resilience amid geopolitical uncertainty mirrors its behavior during past global conflicts. The current pattern is similar to Bitcoin’s price action following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2023, both of which triggered short-term sell-offs before price stabilization. Grayscale Lags Behind as Rivals Attract Capital While most of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed growing investor interest, Grayscale’s products continued to see capital outflows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) lost $16.4 million, and its recently introduced low-fee product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, saw $10.1 million in outflows. Despite early-year sluggishness, total inflows across all 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have surged to $11.2 billion since April 17. Altogether, the funds have attracted over $46.3 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity leading at $50.6 billion and $11.5 billion in total assets under management. Notably, this figure includes more than $23.2 billion in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC. Ether ETFs Regain Momentum Amid Regulatory Clarity Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. also showed signs of strength, posting three consecutive days of net inflows from June 16 to 18 after a brief pause. On Wednesday alone, the products saw over $19.1 million in new capital. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to lead among Ether funds, maintaining an inflow streak on every trading day except two since May 20. Industry analysts say renewed confidence in Ether ETFs stems from the SEC’s recent clarification that protocol-level staking does not constitute a securities transaction.

That number surpassed the net $30.93 billion worth of stocks that were unloaded by institutions in April and is above the net monthly average in the past year of $42.73 billion. S&P Global notes that institutions dumped equities in May due to trade concerns and Moody’s decision to downgrade the United States’ credit rating from AAA to AA1. Explains Thomas McNamara, an S&P Global director of market intelligence, “Institutions still don’t feel that we are out of the woods in relation to tariffs, recession and overall global uncertainty.” Source: S&P Global/X Conversely, index and exchange-traded fund investors gobbled up a net $11.07 billion in stocks last month and $14.46 billion in April. Both of those numbers are significantly less than the 12-month average of $29.44 billion, however. McNamara says it is “never zero-sum” in terms of stock sales. “There are a lot of factors that go into this on a general basis, but this month, a main driver was share buybacks. This may also be a reason why the market rebounded like it did without any long-only conviction.” The S&P 500 is up 0.25% in the past month, and the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 1.6%, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by nearly 1.4%.

Here Are Analysts' Views!","The US Federal Reserve (FED) kept its policy rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, in line with expectations. This decision, which coincided with analyst estimates and CME FedWatch data, caused markets to turn their eyes to September. Bitcoin Sideways: Fed Rate Cut Hopes Shift to September, Seasonal Pressures Continue FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his post-meeting press conference that there was a “downward trend” in inflation. But he noted there was still room to keep rates high because of strong employment and consumer spending. “The Fed has no immediate plans to cut interest rates. The 'wait-and-see' approach continues and it has become clear that the first cut will not occur before September,” said Valentin Fournier, chief analyst at BRN. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut at the FOMC meeting on September 17 is priced in at 62%. Following the Fed’s decision, there was no significant movement in the US stock and futures markets. Similarly, limited price movements were seen in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was trading sideways at $105,000, while Ethereum and XRP also failed to find a significant direction. Could Demand for Bitcoin Increase? David Hernandez, Crypto Investment Expert at 21Shares, stated that the Fed’s policy stance could create a positive backdrop for Bitcoin. “The slowdown in economic growth and persistently high unemployment are increasing stagflation pressure. In such an environment, demand for decentralized, limited-supply assets like Bitcoin could increase,” he said. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates eight times since June 2024 and the Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates to zero, reinforcing the possibility that global liquidity will turn to crypto markets. According to Hernandez, “Bitcoin’s borderless nature makes it flexible to different central bank policies.” Warning of Weak Volume in Summer On the other hand, seasonal risks are on the agenda for the crypto market in the short term. QCP Capital said that investors are acting cautiously, stating that historically trading volumes have decreased in the summer months and the put-call premium rate has increased in the Bitcoin options market. In addition, month-end portfolio rebalancing and reduction of leveraged transactions stand out as additional pressure factors. Summary The Fed has kept interest rates steady, eyes on September for the first cut. Bitcoin is trading sideways at $105,000. Institutional analysts predict that demand for BTC may increase in a stagflation environment. European and Swiss rate cuts increase the likelihood of liquidity flowing into crypto. The summer period may be marked by seasonal stagnation and cautious trading strategies. In an environment of increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as an alternative safe haven for institutional investors. *This is not investment advice.

As he claimed in a post on X, when Kiyosaki started trading, Bitcoin went for $6,000 per coin. Today, the price is almost 18 times as high. Looking five years ahead, the forecast by the author implies no less than an 895% increase from Bitcoin’s current price of around $104,786 at press time on June 19. Indeed, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. While the numbers might seem incredible, Kiyosaki believes such growth is plausible as ownership volume matters more than the current price. In his own words: “While price is important …. the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin. How many ounces of gold and silver and Bitcoin do you own? The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices.” PRICE vs QUANTITY Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity.

While I watch the price of Bitcoin I focus on how many… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 18, 2025 Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin stance Kiyosaki’s emphasis on how much of each asset one owns implies that he sees Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and fiat currency devaluation. Indeed, a known critic of fiat, the financial educator urged his followers in the same post to put their trust in hard assets instead of “fake money.” The admonition retireates Kiyosaki’s June 2 statement about the unfolding global crisis presenting as a potential opportunity for proactive investors. Do not say I didn’t warn anyone. As predicted in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy (2013) the biggest crash in history is coming. I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer.

According to a press release shared with crypto.news on June 19, XBTO has partnered with Arab Bank Switzerland to roll out a new Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield product, marking one of the first instances of a traditional Swiss private bank offering such a service directly to clients. The product, designed for high-net-worth individuals seeking yield on idle Bitcoin, combines the bank’s established digital asset infrastructure with XBTO’s proprietary “Diamond Hands” strategy, an options-based approach aimed at generating yield while accumulating Bitcoin during market dips. You might also like: Bubblemaps V2 goes live on Open Network Romain Braud, Head of Digital Assets at Arab Bank Switzerland, said the offering is fully integrated into the bank’s wealth management services, ensuring institutional oversight and regulatory compliance. “We have seen growing demand from our wealth management clients for ways to generate yield on their Bitcoin holdings within a properly managed risk framework. This collaboration will position Arab Bank Switzerland as the first traditional Swiss private bank to offer an integrated, bank-branded Bitcoin yield product, while maintaining the personal relationship and fiduciary care clients expect from private banking,” Braud noted. The partnership represents a significant step in crypto’s slow but steady penetration into the private banking mainstream. While institutions have dipped their toes into custody and token exposure, few have ventured into active yield strategies under a regulated, client-facing structure. For Arab Bank Switzerland, the development builds on its Bitcoin custody services, which it has offered through a partnership with Taurus since 2019. The move could pressure competitors to follow suit, accelerating crypto’s assimilation into private banking’s inner sanctum. At the same time, XBTO has further cemented its role as a bridge between institutional crypto strategies and traditional wealth management.

2025-06-19T14:10:45,"Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Astonishing Growth Reveals Unshakeable HODL Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Astonishing Growth Reveals Unshakeable HODL Conviction Have you ever wondered what happens to Bitcoin that just sits untouched for years? In the fast-paced world of crypto, it’s easy to focus on daily price swings and trading volumes. But a fascinating trend is quietly unfolding that speaks volumes about the conviction of early adopters and long-term investors: the significant growth in the Bitcoin dormant supply . What Exactly is the Bitcoin Dormant Supply? When we talk about the Bitcoin dormant supply , we’re referring to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from its wallet address for a significant period. The most compelling category, and the focus of recent analysis, is Bitcoin that has remained untouched for over 10 years . Think of these coins as digital artifacts, relics from Bitcoin’s earliest days, held by individuals who acquired them long before Bitcoin became a household name. This category is particularly interesting because coins held for such an extended time are less likely to be part of active trading strategies. They represent a deep, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s future value, often associated with what the crypto community affectionately calls “ Bitcoin long-term holders ” or simply “HODLers” (Hold On for Dear Life). The Astonishing Growth: More Dormant Than Newly Mined? Recent data from a Fidelity Digital Assets report, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a truly striking trend. Since April 2024, an average of approximately 566 Bitcoin that has remained unmoved for over a decade has been added to this “ancient supply” category every single day . To put this into perspective, consider the current rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Following the latest BTC halving event in April 2024, the reward for miners was cut in half. Miners now collectively earn around 450 Bitcoin per day (block reward of 3.125 BTC every ~10 minutes). The fact that the volume of Bitcoin becoming dormant for over 10 years surpasses the current daily issuance by miners is a powerful indicator of accumulation and holding behaviour. Here’s a simple comparison: Metric Approximate Daily BTC Amount (Since April 2024) New BTC Issued by Miners ~450 BTC BTC Becoming 10+ Years Dormant ~566 BTC This dynamic suggests that more Bitcoin is moving into the category of long-term, likely inaccessible or deeply held supply, than is being created each day. This has significant implications for overall Bitcoin supply dynamics . The Ever-Growing Treasure Trove of Ancient Bitcoin According to the Fidelity report, this ancient supply now represents a substantial portion of the total BTC supply that has ever been mined. It accounts for more than 17% of all mined Bitcoin , which is roughly 3.4 million BTC. Valuing this ancient hoard is difficult given Bitcoin’s price volatility. The report cited a value of approximately $360 billion based on a price of $107,000 per coin at the time of their analysis. While the price fluctuates, the sheer volume of 3.4 million BTC sitting unmoved for a decade highlights the immense value locked away by these conviction-driven holders. Why Are So Many Bitcoins Becoming Dormant? The Power of Bitcoin HODL The primary driver behind the growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply is the strong conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders . These individuals aren’t looking for quick profits. They likely acquired their Bitcoin when the price was significantly lower and have weathered multiple market cycles, corrections, and periods of intense volatility. Their decision not to move or sell their Bitcoin for over a decade indicates several possibilities: Unshakeable Belief: They hold a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as digital gold or a global reserve asset. Early Acquisition: Many of these coins were mined or purchased in Bitcoin’s infancy, potentially at very low costs, reducing the pressure to sell for profit. Lost or Inaccessible Keys: Sadly, some portion of this dormant supply may represent coins whose private keys have been lost or forgotten over the years. Estate Planning/Inheritance: Some may be held within long-term estate plans, intended for future generations. Strategic Holding: Sophisticated investors or entities might be intentionally holding large amounts off-exchange as a long-term strategic allocation. Regardless of the exact reason, the sheer volume of Bitcoin remaining dormant for so long is a powerful testament to the Bitcoin HODL philosophy and reduces the potentially available supply on exchanges. Future Projections and the Impact of the BTC Halving The Fidelity report makes compelling projections about the future growth of this ancient supply, largely influenced by the predictable nature of the BTC halving schedule. As time passes, more and more existing Bitcoin will cross the 10-year threshold, automatically adding to the dormant count, while the rate of new Bitcoin creation continues to decrease every four years due to the halving. Fidelity projects that the ancient supply’s share of the total mined BTC supply could rise to: 20% by 2028: The year of the next anticipated BTC halving . 25% by 2034: Further increasing its dominance over the newly issued supply. This interaction between the fixed issuance schedule dictated by the BTC halving and the behaviour of Bitcoin long-term holders profoundly impacts Bitcoin supply dynamics . As the rate of new supply shrinks and the amount of old, unmoved supply grows, the effectively available supply for trading and new investment becomes increasingly scarce. Implications for Bitcoin Supply Dynamics and the Market The consistent growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply has several key implications for the market: Reduced Selling Pressure: Coins held for over 10 years are statistically far less likely to be sold in response to market fluctuations compared to newer coins or those held by short-term traders. This removes a significant potential source of selling pressure from the market. Increased Scarcity: While Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million, the circulating and *actively traded* supply is what truly matters for price discovery. As the dormant supply grows, the effectively available supply becomes scarcer, which can be a bullish factor assuming demand remains constant or increases. Indicator of Conviction: The trend serves as a strong signal of confidence from some of the earliest and most resilient Bitcoin holders. Their unwillingness to sell, even after immense price appreciation, speaks to a belief in even greater future value. Understanding these Bitcoin supply dynamics is crucial for anyone trying to grasp Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. It’s not just about how much Bitcoin exists, but how much is actually in active circulation. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Dormant Supply? While the growth in Bitcoin dormant supply is often seen as a positive indicator of strong holding conviction, it’s not without potential considerations: Lost Access: As mentioned, some portion is likely lost forever due to lost keys. This permanently removes those coins from circulation. Future Movement: While unlikely for the majority, a sudden need or decision by a large, ancient holder to move or sell a significant amount of Bitcoin could potentially impact the market, although the logistics of selling such a large amount without impacting the price are challenging. Concentration Risk: A large amount of supply is concentrated in the hands of early holders. While they have demonstrated resilience, this concentration is a factor in the overall supply distribution. However, the consistent growth of this category suggests that for every holder who might lose access or eventually sell, there are many more who remain steadfast in their Bitcoin HODL strategy. Conclusion: The Silent Strength of Bitcoin’s Ancient Supply The recent data showing Bitcoin dormant supply growing faster than new coins are mined is a powerful narrative. It underscores the unwavering conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders and highlights the unique Bitcoin supply dynamics at play, particularly in the wake of the latest BTC halving . As Fidelity projects this ancient supply to constitute an even larger percentage of the total BTC supply in the coming years, the scarcity factor becomes increasingly pronounced. The trend of deep-seated Bitcoin HODL isn’t just a meme; it’s a quantifiable force shaping the future availability and potential value of Bitcoin. This growth in dormant supply, exceeding the rate of new issuance, is a silent but strong indicator of the market’s long-term perspective on Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that beneath the daily noise, a significant portion of the network’s value is held by those who believe in its transformative potential over decades, not just days or months. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-06-19T14:09:22,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Price Action Remains Flat As Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady","Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below $105,000 since Tuesday as growing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating geopolitical tensions seem to have taken the wind out of the flagship cryptocurrency’s sails. BTC has struggled to gain momentum since dropping below $110,000 on Wednesday (June 11). It plunged to a low of $102,854 before recovering and moving to current levels, marginally down over the past 24 hours as it struggles to reclaim $105,000. Trump Furious At Fed Rate Cut Stance US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates. The Fed left interest rates unchanged again, prompting Trump to take to Truth Social and criticize Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump posted, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy who’s costing America $Billions!” He also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site. The article quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator, who called for Powell to step down if he kept interest rates steady. The decision left Bitcoin at a standstill. BTC has hovered around $104,000-$105,000 since the Fed voted to maintain its current monetary policy in June. Analysts believe the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s price action, much to the dismay of traders. Fed Chair Jerome Powell justified keeping interest rates steady, adding that “policymakers are well-positioned to wait” before moving further on interest rates. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be. I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects.” Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, between 4.25% and 4.50%, expecting elevated inflation and slowed economic growth. However, the Fed expects to make two rate cuts later this year. However, it removed one reduction for 2026 and 2027, putting the expected future rate cuts at four or one percentage point. The Reserve's “dot plot” indicated continued uncertainty about future rate cuts. Each dot represents an official’s expectations for rates. Seven of the nineteen participants indicated they did not want any cuts this year. However, the Committee unanimously approved the policy statement. The FOMC stated, “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated there was time to wait for more clarity, stating, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their inflow streak, recording their eighth day of inflows despite Middle East tensions. The ETFs recorded $388.3 million in inflows on Wednesday, as institutional interest shows no sign of waning. According to data from Farside, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), led with $278.9 million and $104.4 million in inflows. The strong inflows reiterate the fact that institutional interest and confidence in BTC remains strong. Crypto analytics platform Santiment stated, “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104K-$105K range, aided by consistent ETF inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum as resistance around $105,000-$106,000 blocks a move past $110,000. Rising macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating Middle East tensions have pushed investors into a “wait-and-watch” approach, thanks to market uncertainty. As a result, BTC’s bull run has hit pause, with the $112,000 level proving to be a stubborn barrier. Rising geopolitical tensions, including the Israel-Iran conflict, have created a risk-off sentiment among investors. As a result, they have pivoted to traditional safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys, with gold nearing all-time highs this week. BTC and other risk assets have faced reduced demand in recent sessions, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping nearly 4% since Israel’s first attack on Iran. The Nobitex hack added to the pressure, further weighing down the price. The Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged has also dampened momentum. The Fed’s cautious approach is due to persistent inflation and concerns about tariff-induced pressures under the Trump administration. These concerns have also reduced expectations of a Fed rate cut in 2025. The Fed’s restrictive monetary policy strengthens the US Dollar and pressures risk assets like BTC . Market watchers believe the circumstances in which the Fed is fighting inflation are exceptional. QCP Capital stated in a note, “This is no ordinary inflation fight. Our base case is that the Fed may adopt a more cautious tone in its September, potentially indicating a single rate cut for 2025, in contrast to market pricing. Such a revision would likely pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin and broader digital assets, as liquidity expectations are pared back.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to surge past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday and fell 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC dropped nearly 1% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as markets turned bearish. As a result, the price fell over 2%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,519. BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering a marginal increase and moving to $104,884. The current session sees BTC down 0.50%, trading around $104,358. If BTC slips below $103,000, it could drop to $100,000 or lower. On the other hand, if buyers regain momentum and push above $106,000, BTC could move to $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This all began with a Bitcoin scandal. After two days of discussions in the Czech lower house of Parliament, 94 officials from the opposition party voted in favor of forcing out the government, the AP reported . However, for that to happen, the opposition needed 101 out of the 200 seats. Source: Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Twitter Notably, this is not the first such motion over the past four years. It’s the fourth since this four-party coalition government took leadership. Moreover, the next parliamentary election is set for early October, with the opposition likely to win. Earlier this year, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek accepted a large donation in BTC, which he sold for about $45.8 million in March. In May, the opposition raised concerns over the source of the donation, and by the end of the month, Blažek resigned. The main opposition centrist ANO (YES) movement, with billionaire Andrej Babiš at the helm, requested a vote of no-confidence, looking to oust the current government. Subsequently, Eva Decroix, deputy chair of the Civic Democratic Party, has been appointed as the country’s new Minister of Justice.

On Friday, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned, with the opposition set to demand the resignation of the coalition government this week as well.The situation caught on fire at the end of last week after Blažek, a conservative politician, accepted a large donation in BTC and sold it for about $45.8 million in March, the AP reported. The opposition has raised concerns over the source of the donation.Blažek received the coins... So, How is BTC Involved? In March 2025, a lawyer representing Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal, reportedly approached Blažek, saying that the client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Before his arrest, Jirikovsky had operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Police confiscated his wallet containing BTC but returned it after his release in 2021. The opposition party raised concerns over the origin of this donated BTC , since Blažek did not do any checks. But Blažek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. “I have no way to investigate the matter, and I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” he said. Blažek also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus, a dark web marketplace that reportedly shut its doors the day after Jirikovsky’s arrest. Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC, dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Blažek claimed he hadn’t made any promises in return for the donation.

2025-06-19T14:00:18,"Coinbase Introduces Circle’s USDC Stablecoin As Collateral In US Futures","US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has announced a partnership with Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) Nodal Clear to integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin as collateral for futures trading. USDC Set To Become Regulated Collateral According to the official announcement released on Wednesday, Coinbase Derivatives, LLC, which operates as a designated contract market regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will work alongside Nodal Clear under a multi-year renewal agreement, aimed to make USDC eligible as collateral for futures trading starting next year. Boris Ilyevsky, CEO of Coinbase Derivatives, highlighted that this initiative represents a meaningful step in establishing USDC as a viable cash equivalent, enhancing efficiency in financial transactions through near-instant money movement and secure custody solutions. Ilyevsky stated, “Our commitment to integrate USDC as collateral reflects our dedication to enhance trading capabilities for US market participants.” This integration is expected to not only improve operational efficiency but also ensure secure custody through Coinbase Custody Trust, which is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Circle And Coinbase Stocks Rise Paul Cusenza, Chairman and CEO of Nodal Clear, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “We are excited to continue our relationship with Coinbase Derivatives and provide innovation to the industry.” He noted that the plans to integrate USDC as collateral are part of their ongoing commitment to respond to market needs, aiming for a forward-thinking approach in the trading ecosystem . As the financial landscape evolves, stablecoins like USDC are increasingly recognized for their potential to create a more flexible and modern financial system. US regulators are making strides to support this innovation, with Congress moving towards passing legislation that would affirm the cash equivalence of USDC. The CFTC has also been actively promoting the recognition of stablecoins, evidenced by recommendations from its Global Markets Advisory Committee to broaden the use of non-cash collateral through distributed ledger technology. This momentum has positively impacted the market, with shares of both Circle and Coinbase experiencing significant gains following the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Act. Circle’s stock surged by 33% after the bill was passed, continuing a remarkable rally since its stock market debut. Meanwhile, Coinbase, which co-founded USDC and shares its revenue with Circle, saw its shares rise by over 16%. As stablecoins become a more prominent source of revenue for Coinbase, with stablecoin-related income jumping 50% year-over-year in the first quarter, the integration of USDC into futures trading is poised to play a crucial role in revolutionizing the global financial system.

2025-06-19T13:57:00,"Bitcoin Price Trapped Between Key EMAs As Volume And RSI Reflect Market Indecision (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin consolidates as short-term EMAs compress the price into a narrow range. Volume weakens on Binance, aligning with neutral RSI to confirm indecision. Key breakout zones identified as the market awaits trigger for directional move. By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin price ( BTC-USD ) has been locked in a tight range over the past week, trading between the well-defined resistance at $108,900 and support at $103,000. As of the European session today, June 19, Bitcoin is hovering around $104,700, barely moving from its earlier levels in the Asian session. This consolidation reflects growing market indecision, particularly as price trades below short-term resistance and above firm support zones. The 20-day EMA currently stands at $105,790, just overhead from Bitcoin’s present level, while the 50-day EMA sits closer to the lower boundary at $103,000. This configuration is compressing price into a narrow band, forming a technical squeeze. The 50-day EMA reinforces the recent support level, increasing the likelihood that $103,000 holds firm in the near term unless significant momentum shifts. BTC price dynamics (May - June 2025). Source: TradingView Volume data adds another layer to the picture. Binance’s spot volume on Bitcoin declined yesterday compared to the last three trading days. This weakening in participation indicates a lack of conviction from both bulls and bears. It also aligns with the Relative Strength Index on the daily timeframe, which is parked near neutral territory. The RSI reading reflects a market that is yet to favour either direction, further validating the range-bound structure. Bitcoin technical squeeze continues amid rising Middle-East tensions On the 4-hour chart, a stack of EMA layers sits above current price levels. This implies any bullish breakout will face multiple layers of technical resistance, which could slow upward moves unless volume expands meaningfully. However, a successful breakout through this EMA cluster will likely test $108,900 and, if that level is cleared, extend to $110,500. A move toward the all-time high at $112,000 may follow if the broader market turns risk-on. On the downside, if Bitcoin fails to defend the 50-day EMA and drops below $103,000, immediate attention will shift to $101,000. This level serves as the next key support before the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold, which could trigger wider selling if breached. Until then, the price action suggests Bitcoin is in consolidation, caught between opposing technical forces and a muted sentiment environment as traders observe the conflict in the Middle-East. A decisive move outside this EMA boundary will set the tone for the next directional trend. Bitcoin stalled near $103,000 as compressed EMA blocked further upside .

The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged also impacted the market, with prices retreating. Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around $105,000 as neither buyers nor sellers could decisively take control. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $103,695 before recovering and moving to its current levels. However, it is struggling to reclaim $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) remained in the red as well, with the world’s second-largest down nearly 9% over the past week. ETH is currently trading around $2,519 after recovering from a low of $2,469. Ripple (XRP) has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 2%, trading around $145. Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to stay above $0.170, with the price marginally down, while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 3%, trading around $0.598. Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. However, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the bearish trend, with the price marginally up, trading around $13.10. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, between 4.25% and 4.50%, expecting elevated inflation and slowed economic growth. However, the Fed expects to make two rate cuts later this year. However, it removed one reduction for 2026 and 2027, putting the expected future rate cuts at four or one percentage point. The Reserve's “dot plot” indicated continued uncertainty about future rate cuts. Each dot represents an official’s expectations for rates. Seven of the nineteen participants indicated they did not want any cuts this year. However, the Committee unanimously approved the policy statement. Economic projections also indicated growing stagflationary pressures, with officials indicating that gross domestic product (GDP) was advancing at 1.4% in 2025 while inflation was hitting 3%. The revised forecasts show a decrease of 0.3 percentage points for GDP and a similar increase for the personal consumption expenditures price index. Core PCE, which eliminates food and energy prices, was projected at 3.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher. Unemployment was up to 4.5%, 0.1 percentage point higher than March and 0.3 percentage point higher than the current level. The FOMC stated, “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated there was time to wait for more clarity, stating, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.” Iran’s Nobitex Exchange Hacked By Pro-Israel Group Pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande has claimed to have destroyed over $90 million stolen from Nobitex’s wallets. The group issued an update stating it had burned the funds across multiple blockchains using “vanity addresses” containing no recoverable private keys. This renders the funds permanently inaccessible. The news comes after the high-profile exploit of Iran’s largest exchange, which saw over $90 million in BTC, ETH, DOGE, and other tokens drained from its hot wallets. The hackers justified the breach as a response to the exchange’s alleged role in helping the Iranian regime circumvent sanctions. The group tied the hack to the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, which have intensified following airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites. Blockchain security firm Chainalysis confirmed the stolen assets had not been transferred to crypto mixers or exchanges and were sent to irretrievable addresses with inflammatory labels. Meanwhile, Nobitex acknowledged the burn and assured users their funds were safe in cold storage. The exchange also clarified that its staff had emptied its hot wallets and that no customer funds would be lost thanks to its reserve fund and insurance pool. Circle Stock Soars As GENIUS Act Passes Circle’s stock surged over 34% on June 18, briefly touching an all-time high of $200.90 before closing at $199.59. The increase is a 6.5-fold increase from Circle’s initial public offering price of $31. The rally came after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act to establish a comprehensive federal framework to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins like Circle’s USDC. The legislation cleared the Senate with a 68-30 vote and now heads to the US House of Representatives. House Financial Services Committee staff confirmed that scheduling discussions will begin next week. However, a floor vote date is yet to be decided. Coinbase’s stock also rose 14%, while Robinhood rose 4.5% to reach a new all-time high of $78.35. The market’s reaction to the passage of the GENIUS Act indicates growing confidence that federal oversight could accelerate mainstream adoption and de-risk the regulatory landscape for US-based stablecoin issuers. President Trump Urges House To Pass The GENIUS Act United States President Donald Trump has urged the House to pass the GENIUS Act as soon as possible so he can officially sign it into law. Trump took to Truth Social to urge the House to “Get it on my desk ASAP.” “The Senate just passed an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets. Get it to my desk ASAP — NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS.” Trump’s message came after the Senate passed the bill 68-30. Supporters of the bill believe it will play a crucial role in maintaining the dollar’s dominance in global finance. Senator Bill Hagerty, also the bill’s sponsor, stated that it would allow businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country to settle payments instantaneously instead of waiting for days or even weeks. The bill faced early setbacks, failing a closure vote in the Senate in May after Democrats voiced concerns about Trump’s connections with the crypto industry. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill's fiercest critics, stated that Trump and his family would make millions from the USD1 stablecoin if the GENIUS Act passed. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal increase on Tuesday despite volatility and selling pressure. However, it is struggling to build momentum and reclaim $105,000, with buyers unable to push prices higher. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week positively, racing to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday. Despite this, it failed to maintain momentum and settled at $106,806. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions escalated. As a result, BTC plunged below $105,000, falling to a low of $103,400 before settling at $104,518. BTC is trading within a narrow band, ranging from $103,000 to $107,500. The price has stabilized around the $105,000 mark, with analysts stating the price must hold above $103,000 to retain chances of a potential breakout. While BTC risks further downside, if it maintains its position above $103,000, it would suggest markets are absorbing the selling pressure effectively. However, the market situation also presents investors with a high-stakes yet potentially rewarding opportunity for investors. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland stated on X, “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise’s ETP platform ETC Group, believes that BTC’s price can suffer following an outbreak of hostilities between two or more countries. While volatility in BTC is seen as reducing, it is still viewed as a risky asset and is likely to be sold quickly if geopolitical tensions escalate. Mthink Thakore, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin Layer2 liquidity protocol Velar, stated, “Over the longer term, geopolitical conflicts raise the prospects of higher inflation rates globally due to factors like increased fiscal spending, looser monetary policy, supply-chain disruptions, and commodity price spikes, which should all benefit Bitcoin.” BTC has shown remarkable resilience during geopolitical tensions. However, a lack of price movement does not necessarily make BTC a hedge during geopolitical uncertainty. BTC ended the previous weekend positively, registering a marginal increase to reclaim $105,000 on Sunday and settle at $105,791. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,325 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. Sentiment turned bearish on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.43%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,686. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3%, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106.

2025-06-19T13:50:40,"Bitcoin scarcity expected to grow as ancient whales' hoarded stockpile peaks","Wallets aged over 10 years are driving the scarcity of BTC. Each day, coins marked as long-term storage grow larger compared to newly mined Bitcoins. For the first time, BTC held in long-term supply is growing faster than the supply of newly mined coins. More and more wallets are crossing the 10-year mark with no coins moved, adding to the increasing scarcity of available Bitcoin. The share of ancient supply as a percentage of total BTC supply is near a record, as older holders are unwilling to sell. | Source: Fidelity Digital Assets Satoshi Nakamoto is the original ancient whales While initially intended as electronic cash for daily payments, Bitcoin has turned into a reserve asset. In the past decade, BTC also developed its strong ‘hodl’ ethic, leading to the creation of multiple whale wallets with no intention to sell or move coins. This idle supply was added to the coins held in early miner wallets, including those of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is the first big holder of wallets older than a decade. Soon after that, the supply of early miners also joined that cohort, reaching new peaks in 2025. Currently, over 566 BTC on average move into the ancient supply category, surpassing the newly mined 450 BTC per day. Over time, a peak 17% or roughly 3.5M coins of Bitcoin supply is now in the long-term holdings of ancient whales, which may not enter circulation again. Over time, the coins locked in ancient stockpiles will only increase. Some of the ancient wallets are relatively small. Currently, there are only 93 wallets with over 10K Bitcoins, as even whales are trying to secure their assets on multiple addresses. More than 2M wallets have over 1,000 BTC . Ancient BTC whales show long-term conviction The ancient supply of BTC contains coins that are considered lost, forgotten, or unmovable for some reason. On very rare occasions, an old wallet will awaken and move or sell some of the coins. However, selling Bitcoins is seen as abandoning the long-term potential of the coin, especially at a time when corporate buyers are scrambling for a dwindling supply of BTC to be locked in treasuries. Bitcoin treasuries are newer, but also hold over 3.39M BTC, catching up with the ancient supply. Scarcity is also driven by other long-term cohorts, including wallets aged 7-10 years and those over five years old. Most of the flux of BTC holdings comes from the earliest wallet cohorts, created under three months ago, as well as from buyers realizing profits from the recent bull market. Some of the whale wallets are specifically engaging in trading, but the overall trend is for even more Bitcoin to become unavailable. Bitcoin daily transactions are at around 440K, near a 12-month low. Currently, on-chain activity is extremely subdued, while traders use the derivative markets to trade “paper BTC.” The expected supply crunch may start affecting the market, as new sources of Bitcoin and willing sellers are getting depleted. Even retail holders have already sold their coins, with significant outflows at much lower prices in the past year. Exchanges and OTC desks are also decreasing their available supply. Unmoved Bitcoin may continue to expand in the coming years, as even 500 BTC would be enough to set up a treasury company. Holders may never sell, instead tapping the value of their Bitcoin through various forms of staking, reserves, or lending. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-19T13:44:19,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Ancient Wallets Hoard More BTC Than Miners Can Replace – Supply Shock Coming?","Bitcoin supply dynamics are tightening in a way we’ve never seen before. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, 550 BTC per day are now being classified as “ancient,” meaning coins untouched for over 10 years, surpassing the daily mining rate of 450 BTC. This marks a historic inversion in Bitcoin’s supply mechanics. Over 17% of the total BTC supply is now illiquid, and that figure could surge to 30% by 2026. BULLISH: Bitcoin Supply Squeeze COMING! ""Ancient"" bitcoin supply is growing faster than newly mined coins. Addresses that have held coins for 10 years or longer are now outstripping new supply. pic.twitter.com/D9Mk12gPB2 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 19, 2025 Ancient BTC holders rarely sell: net outflows occurred less than 3% of the time. After the 2024 election, even long-term wallets showed brief activity. Illiquid supply growth signals firm conviction despite price volatility. This imbalance between shrinking liquid supply and ongoing demand is laying the groundwork for what analysts call a structural supply shock. Institutions Gear Up to Absorb Millions of Bitcoins The demand side of the equation is equally compelling. Asset manager Bitwise estimates that inflows into Bitcoin will reach $120 billion by 2025, growing to $300 billion in a base case and $426 billion in a bullish scenario. That could absorb over 4 million BTC, nearly 19% of the total capped supply. What’s fueling this? Public companies and pension funds are slowly increasing their BTC exposure US states and cities are exploring treasury allocations Advisors on major platforms now offer 1–3% BTC model portfolios Despite $35 billion in sidelined interest due to compliance hesitations at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the institutional tide is shifting. With these players collectively managing over $60 trillion, even small allocations have significant implications. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Coils Near Critical Trendline On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is consolidating at $104,600. Price action is tightening along a rising trendline from the June 5 low. The 50-period EMA is sloping down at $105,381 and has been rejecting upside moves. The MACD lines are flat below zero, indicating a potential breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Levels to Watch: Support: $104,000 and $103,431 Resistance: $105,600-$105,800; above opens up $106,658 and $107,748 Bitcoin Trade Idea Longs look to confirm a breakout above $105,600 to $106,658 and $107,748 with a stop under $104,000—shorts below $103,400 to $102,200 and $100,449. Institutional flows are rising, and old supply is locking up BTC. Now, it’s time to see if price follows fundamentals or if volatility will shake out before the next leg up. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

2025-06-19T13:30:09,"Jerome Powell Attacked: Trump Launches Furious Blast at Federal Reserve Chair","BitcoinWorld Jerome Powell Attacked: Trump Launches Furious Blast at Federal Reserve Chair In the often-unpredictable world where politics collides with economic policy, recent comments from Donald Trump regarding Jerome Powell , the current Chair of the Federal Reserve , have certainly grabbed headlines. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these high-level economic and political tensions is crucial, as they can ripple through the broader US economy and influence market sentiment, including digital assets. Why is Donald Trump Attacking Jerome Powell? Former President Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to unleash sharp criticism directed at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . The language used was notably harsh, labeling Powell as “Too Late—Powell,” “the WORST,” and even “a real dummy.” Trump asserted that Powell’s actions were costing the United States billions of dollars. This isn’t the first time Trump has publicly criticized Powell. During his presidency, Trump frequently attacked the Fed Chair, particularly over decisions related to interest rates . Trump consistently advocated for lower rates, often clashing with the Fed’s mandate for independent monetary policy focused on stable prices and maximum employment. The recent attack also included Trump sharing an article that specifically called for Powell’s resignation. The article reportedly originated from sources associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, key players in the country’s mortgage lending sector. The Federal Reserve’s Latest Move on Interest Rates Adding another layer to this story, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the principal monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve , recently concluded its meeting with a significant announcement: interest rates would remain unchanged. This decision comes at a time when the US economy is grappling with various factors, including inflation concerns, employment data, and global economic uncertainties. The Fed’s strategy has been to use interest rates as a tool to manage economic growth and inflation. Keeping rates steady signals the Fed’s current assessment of the economic landscape, which appears to be at odds with Trump’s critical view. Key points from the Fed’s position: Maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate. Monitoring incoming economic data to guide future decisions. Aiming for maximum employment and inflation at the 2 percent longer-run goal. Acknowledging that economic outlook remains uncertain. Understanding the Impact on the US Economy Attacks on the Federal Reserve Chair and calls for resignation introduce political uncertainty into economic policy discussions. While the Fed operates independently, political pressure can still influence public perception and potentially market reactions. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates directly affect borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, influencing everything from mortgage rates to corporate investments. Lower rates can stimulate borrowing and spending, potentially boosting the US economy but risking higher inflation. Higher rates can curb inflation but may slow down economic growth. Challenges and Considerations: Balancing inflation control with economic growth. Navigating global economic headwinds. Managing market expectations regarding future rate changes. Maintaining the perceived independence of the Federal Reserve from political influence. How Does This Affect Crypto Investors? While seemingly a political squabble about traditional finance, tensions surrounding Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve ‘s policies have indirect but important implications for cryptocurrency markets: Macroeconomic Sentiment: Uncertainty in the traditional US economy can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, viewing them as potential hedges against inflation or economic instability. Interest Rate Environment: The Fed’s stance on interest rates impacts the liquidity in the financial system. Lower rates generally make riskier assets (like crypto) more attractive compared to lower-yield traditional investments. Higher rates can pull capital away from risk assets. Dollar Strength: Fed policy influences the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international buyers. Regulatory Landscape: Political pressure on economic institutions can sometimes spill over into discussions about regulating emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insight: Stay informed about the Federal Reserve ‘s announcements and general macroeconomic trends. While crypto markets have unique drivers, they are not entirely insulated from the broader financial system and political climate surrounding figures like Jerome Powell and Donald Trump . Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty The recent, fierce criticism from Donald Trump towards Jerome Powell highlights ongoing political tensions surrounding the leadership and policies of the Federal Reserve . Despite these attacks, the Fed’s FOMC has maintained its course, keeping interest rates unchanged in response to its assessment of the US economy . This dynamic interplay between political rhetoric and independent monetary policy creates a layer of uncertainty. For those involved in cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic signals and the potential impacts of political pressure on institutions like the Federal Reserve is vital for making informed decisions in an interconnected global market.

2025-06-19T13:30:05,"Introducing Bitcoin staking: New opportunities for clients to earn yield on their BTC holdings","We’re excited to announce the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) staking through a new integration with Babylon , a Bitcoin -native staking protocol. This integration enables clients to earn passive rewards on their BTC without bridging , wrapping or lending it out . Beginning today, clients can choose to stake their BTC directly from Kraken. Their BTC is delegated, via Babylon, to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks . Staked Bitcoin rewards are paid in $BABY , Babylon’s native token. Clients retain full ownership of their BTC, which never leaves the Bitcoin blockchain . The staking mechanism is governed by a smart contract, so users and third parties can verify how rewards are handled. The BTC staking protocol also includes cryptographic safeguards to deter and penalize malicious behaviors. Clients can unstake at any time, with a 7-day unbonding period before funds are returned. This launch marks a significant expansion of our growing staking suite and further reinforces our leadership in product innovation. We were one of the first crypto exchanges to introduce custodial staking in 2019, enabling millions of users to earn rewards through our Earn platform. Kraken Global Head of Consumer Mark Greenberg: “A substantial amount of bitcoin currently sits idle on our exchange, representing a significant opportunity cost for clients and a missed opportunity for the broader ecosystem. With this launch, clients can now earn a return on their BTC while also enabling emerging PoS blockchains to benefit from the economic weight of Bitcoin in order to validate transactions and bolster the security of their networks.” The BTC staking product is available starting today across all our platform interfaces, including Kraken and Kraken Pro . Explore Bitcoin staking Geographic restrictions apply. Projected annual rate is an estimate based on the average staking rewards accrued over the past period, before commission, and is subject to change. Staking involves risks including no guarantee of rewards, potential loss from slashing or hacks, and depreciation in the value of assets while staked.

2025-06-19T13:30:00,"Iran Imposes Crypto Exchange Curfew After $100M Nobitex Hack","Iran’s central bank has imposed strict operating hours on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges following a devastating $100 million exploit on Nobitex, the country’s largest digital asset platform. The attack, reportedly carried out by a pro-Israel hacker group, has prompted a swift government response aimed at reducing the risk of further cyber intrusions. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the new curfew limits exchanges to functioning only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. local time. Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, recently stated that the move likely aims to contain the potential damage of future incidents. “Incidents are easier to triage if they’re not happening in the middle of the night,” he noted. The Nobitex hack occurred early Wednesday morning , during off-peak hours. Chainalysis also suggested that the Iranian government may be using the curfew to tighten control over citizen transactions, especially in a time of high geopolitical tension and the risk of capital flight. This is not the first time Iran has restricted crypto activity—last December, authorities shut down all exchanges temporarily to stabilize the rial. Pro-Israel Hackers Burned the Stolen Crypto The hacking group Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for infiltrating Nobitex’s systems and draining its hot wallets of major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana. Chainalysis reported that the stolen funds were sent to burner wallets—addresses with no private key access—effectively removing the assets from circulation. “This attack stands out not just for its size but for its motive,” Fierman said. “Unlike typical hacks motivated by profit, this one appears politically driven, intended to deprive the Iranian regime of access to funds.” Nobitex, which facilitates more than $11 billion in inflows—far surpassing any other Iranian exchange—has acknowledged the breach. In a statement on X, the platform said it has severed all external access to its servers and moved remaining funds from hot wallets to secure cold storage. Nobitex Struggles to Restore Access Although Nobitex claims the situation is under control, user access remains suspended. The exchange confirmed that its Reserve Fund will cover all losses incurred in the breach. However, it warned that ongoing internet disruptions and additional security protocols may delay the restoration of full services. As a key player in Iran’s crypto space, Nobitex’s compromise could have ripple effects throughout the region. Chainalysis highlighted its role in facilitating global crypto access for Iranian users—many of whom are otherwise cut off from international financial systems.

2025-06-19T13:20:06,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot ETH ETFs Record $19.1M on June 18","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot ETH ETFs Record $19.1M on June 18 Are you watching the crypto market, especially the developments around US spot ETH ETFs ? There’s exciting news from June 18, as these newly launched investment products experienced their third consecutive day of net inflows, bringing in a combined $19.1 million. This trend signals growing investor interest and provides valuable insights into the market’s sentiment towards Ethereum. Understanding the Significance of US Spot ETH ETFs Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch on why US spot ETH ETFs are such a big deal. These exchange-traded funds hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, offering traditional investors exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without needing to directly buy, store, or manage ETH themselves. This simplifies investment and opens the door for broader participation from both retail and institutional investors. The approval and subsequent launch of these funds in the U.S. are considered a major milestone for the crypto industry, similar to the impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. They provide a regulated and accessible pathway into the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially increasing liquidity and market maturity. Breaking Down the Latest ETF Inflows According to data compiled by Farside Investors, June 18 saw a solid performance for ETF inflows into the U.S. spot Ethereum funds. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: Total Net Inflow: $19.1 million Leading Fund (BlackRock’s ETHA): $15.1 million net inflow Second Leading Fund (Grayscale’s mini ETH): $4 million net inflow Other Funds: Reported no change in holdings for the day. This data highlights BlackRock’s ETHA as a dominant player early on, capturing the lion’s share of the day’s inflows. Grayscale’s mini ETH, which is a spin-off from its larger Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), also saw positive movement. Why Does a Third Consecutive Day of Inflows Matter for the ETH Price? Observing a trend is often more insightful than looking at a single day’s data. The fact that June 18 marks the third straight day of net inflows for Ethereum ETF products is significant. It suggests that the initial outflows from Grayscale’s primary ETHE fund, which often occur as investors arbitrage or switch to lower-fee options, might be stabilizing or being offset by fresh capital entering the ecosystem via these new ETFs. Consistent inflows can be interpreted as a positive signal for the market. It indicates sustained buying pressure through these investment vehicles, which could potentially have a positive impact on the underlying ETH price over time, assuming the trend continues and scales up. While $19.1 million might seem modest compared to some Bitcoin ETF figures, a steady stream of inflows builds confidence and liquidity. Comparing ETH ETF Inflows to the Crypto ETF Landscape How do these early Crypto ETF inflows for Ethereum stack up against the experience with spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows shortly after their launch in January, quickly accumulating billions of dollars in assets under management. Ethereum ETFs are still in their nascent stages, having received regulatory approval more recently and with actual trading expected to commence later. The current inflows, while positive, are smaller than the initial frenzy seen with Bitcoin ETFs. However, this could be due to various factors, including market conditions, the specific timing of their trading launch, and differing investor appetites for ETH versus Bitcoin exposure. The key takeaway is that capital is indeed flowing into the Ethereum ETF space, adding a new dimension to the overall ETF inflows narrative in the crypto market. What Potential Benefits and Challenges Do These Inflows Present? The emergence of significant US spot ETH ETFs inflows brings both opportunities and potential hurdles: Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Makes investing in Ethereum easier for traditional investors and institutions. Potential Price Support: Sustained buying through ETFs can add upward pressure on the ETH price . Market Legitimacy: The approval and adoption of these products by major financial institutions like BlackRock lend further credibility to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading volume and assets under management in ETFs can improve market liquidity. Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows can support prices, the crypto market remains inherently volatile, and ETFs are not immune to price swings. Competition: The ETF market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can still evolve. Grayscale Dynamics: Managing outflows from the existing Grayscale ETHE fund remains a factor influencing net flows across the ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum ETFs? The trend of positive ETF inflows is certainly encouraging for Ethereum proponents. As these funds become more established and potentially begin trading, we could see increased interest and larger capital allocations. The performance of BlackRock’s ETHA and other funds will be closely watched as indicators of institutional and retail demand. Continued inflows could provide a tailwind for the ETH price , but market-wide factors, regulatory developments, and overall economic conditions will also play significant roles. Investors interested in this space should monitor the inflow data, track the performance of individual ETFs, and stay informed about the evolving market dynamics. Compelling Summary The $19.1 million net inflow into US spot ETH ETFs on June 18, marking the third consecutive day of positive flows, is a clear indicator that investor interest in Ethereum through regulated investment products is growing. Led by BlackRock and Grayscale’s mini ETH, these inflows suggest increasing accessibility and potential support for the ETH price . While early compared to Bitcoin ETF performance, the trend is positive and adds a new layer of institutional and retail participation to the Ethereum ecosystem. As the market matures, tracking these ETF inflows will be crucial for understanding capital movement and sentiment in the crypto space.

2025-06-19T13:15:27,"Pro-Israel hackers deliver on threat to release Nobitex's source code","A pro-Israel hacking collective has followed through on its promise to release the full source code of Nobitex, Iran’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, just a day after orchestrating a high-profile blockchain exploit involving more than $100 million in digital assets. The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, also referred to as Predatory Sparrow , published a post on social media platform X on Thursday confirming the release of Nobitex’s internal data. “ Time’s up, full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN ,” the post read. Hacker releases blockchain script post $100 million exploit The leak, posted on an X thread, included components of the platform’s infrastructure such as blockchain scripts , internal privacy configurations, and a list of servers. Cybersecurity analysts say the disclosure effectively cripples the back-end security of Nobitex, leaving any remaining assets on the exchange vulnerable to further attacks. Time's up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN. بازمانده دارایی های شما در نوبیتکس هم اکنون در معرض دید و خطر هستند But before that, lets meet Nobitex from the inside: Exchange Deployment (1/8) pic.twitter.com/jiMfBpNXwd — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 19, 2025 The source code release follows through on threats issued a day earlier, when the group claimed responsibility for a coordinated attack across multiple blockchain networks. According to the statement, the group’s motivation stemmed from Nobitex’s alleged role in assisting the Iranian government in bypassing international sanctions . They labeled the exchange as “the regime’s favorite sanctions violation tool.” Predatory Sparrow has taken credit for other cyberattacks in recent days, including one targeting Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah. $100M in crypto burned, not stolen On Wednesday, blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis and Elliptic confirmed that approximately $100 million worth of crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, Tron, and Toncoin, were impacted in the heist. According to Chainalysis’s head of national security intelligence, Andrew Fierman, the stolen assets were sent to burner wallets, cryptographic addresses that the attackers cannot access. Analysts believe the funds were not stolen for profit but were instead destroyed to send a political message. “ The motive for stealing the $90+ million in funds is for something other than financial gain ,” Fierman stated, calling the act symbolic and destructive. Elliptic’s analysis also supports this interpretation, noting the use of provocatively named vanity wallets such as “1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX” and “DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t.” These addresses appear to have been created with brute-force generators and lack recoverable private keys, likely a deliberate effort to make the funds irretrievable. Yehor Rudytsia, a security researcher at blockchain firm Hacken, said the choice of wallet addresses used in the attack was more “political” than a typical financial theft. “ The wallet names and behavior suggest a political statement rather than a financially motivated theft ,” Rudytsia said. He added that most of the assets, over 20 different tokens on EVM-compatible chains, were sent to clean burner addresses. “ The only potential for partial recovery lies with Tether, which could reissue the $55 million in stolen USDT ,” he explained. Nobitex responded to the developments on Thursday, saying that no additional losses occurred following the data leak. The exchange announced plans to restore services within five days, although ongoing internet disruptions inside Iran may slow recovery efforts. Exchange linked to Iranian military and militant groups The hacker has claimed Nobitex is connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a military organization designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canada. Research by Elliptic has previously linked Nobitex to ransomware operatives sanctioned for ties to the IRGC, and individuals with close affiliations to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Blockchain data also shows transactional activity between Nobitex wallets and accounts connected to groups including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Yemen’s Houthi movement.
