2025-06-19T12:52:53,"BitVault to launch BTC-backed stablecoin on Katana chain","Bitcoin and stablecoins are stealing the spotlight, and one company hopes to tap into both of them. Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin narratives converge in the latest funding round. On Thursday, June 18, BitVault secured a $2 million investment to build a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin. The bvUSD stablecoin will launch on Katana, a new chain incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR. GSR is also a strategic investor in the venture, along with Gemini, Auros, and Keyrock. The funding round came amid rising interest in stablecoins, especially after the Genius Act passed the U.S. Senate. With the regulatory clarity introduced by the Genius Act, major banks and tech firms are now considering launching their own stablecoins. However, unlike fiat-backed assets such as USDC, bvUSD will be backed by Bitcoin reserves.

Specifically, the protocol will enable yield generation with staked bvUSD, supported by crypto arbitrage strategies. “Bitcoin was built for moments of fracture. BitVault was built to make it usable,” said Michael Kisselgof, Core Contributor of BitVault and VaultCraft. “We specifically onboarded GSR, Auros, and Keyrock as strategic investors that can also execute high yielding, non-directional strategies to create demand and deep liquidity for BTC-backed money.” According to GSR, an investor in BitVault, the stablecoin venture holds significant potential for the Katana ecosystem. “We’re seeing growing interest in BTC-backed stablecoins, especially those designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems,” said Alain Kunz, Director of GSR. “BitVault adds to Katana’s evolving ecosystem by introducing a new layer of stablecoin utility, enabling BTC to take on a more productive role within Katana’s high-yield DeFi stack.” BitVault is a fork of Liquity V2, launched for institutional use in agreement with Liquity AG. The protocol features a permissioned borrowing layer, combined with core DeFi features.

On June 19, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission announced plans to conduct a fact-finding investigation into transaction fees charged by domestic crypto exchanges, as initially reported the Herald Economy. In a policy briefing to the Presidential Transition Committee, the FSC stated it would examine the current fee structures, methods of fee collection, and revenue from transaction fees at major exchanges such as Bithumb, Upbit, and Coinone. The goal is to evaluate whether current fees pose an excessive burden on consumers and consider appropriate regulatory measures. While the FSC has not set a specific target rate, it will consider global benchmarks and user impact studies in shaping its policy. The investigation will also review whether exchanges transparently disclose their fee structures.

His ETF proposal received rare bipartisan support, with both his opponent Moon-soo and the People Power Party backing the move. Both parties have committed to legalizing spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs within the year . Additionally, Lee proposed allowing the nation’s $884 billion pension fund to invest in cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-19T12:50:43,"Bold Move: BD Multimedia Boosts Bitcoin Treasury with $1.14M Convertible Bonds","BitcoinWorld Bold Move: BD Multimedia Boosts Bitcoin Treasury with $1.14M Convertible Bonds In a significant move signaling the continued convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, French payment solutions provider BD Multimedia has announced a strategic maneuver aimed squarely at strengthening its Bitcoin Treasury . The company revealed via an announcement on X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully issued €1 million, equivalent to approximately $1.14 million, in convertible bonds. But this isn’t just any standard financial transaction; the entire proceeds from this issuance are earmarked for one specific purpose: the direct purchase of Bitcoin (BTC). What Are Convertible Bonds and Why Use Them for a Bitcoin Treasury ? Let’s break down the financial instrument at play here. Convertible bonds are a type of debt security that the holder can convert into a specified number of common stock shares or other equity of the issuing company during a specified period. In simpler terms, it’s like a loan to the company, but instead of just getting their money back with interest, the lender has the option to swap their debt holding for company shares if they believe the stock price will increase. They offer investors potential upside (if the stock rises) while providing the safety of a bond (fixed payments and principal return if not converted). So, why would a company like BD Multimedia use this mechanism specifically to fund a Bitcoin Treasury ? There are several potential reasons: Accessing Capital: Convertible bonds can sometimes be issued at lower interest rates than traditional bonds because the conversion option is valuable to investors. This makes it a potentially cheaper way to raise funds compared to taking out a standard loan or issuing regular bonds. Flexibility: It allows the company to raise funds without immediately diluting existing shareholders (as would happen with a direct stock offering). Dilution only occurs if and when the bonds are converted into shares. Strategic Asset Acquisition: By specifically tying the bond proceeds to BTC purchase, BD Multimedia clearly signals its commitment to Bitcoin as a strategic asset, potentially attracting investors interested in both the company’s core business and its exposure to cryptocurrency. Using this financial tool provides a structured way for the company to acquire a significant amount of BTC for its balance sheet, building out its corporate Bitcoin Treasury without solely relying on existing cash reserves or more dilutive equity financing. Who is BD Multimedia and Why Are They Buying Bitcoin? Based in France, BD Multimedia is known primarily as a provider of payment solutions and internet services. Their core business involves facilitating online transactions and offering various digital services. While perhaps not a household name on the same scale as a tech giant, their decision to allocate corporate funds to Bitcoin is noteworthy, especially coming from a traditional financial services adjacent sector within Europe. The ‘why’ behind companies buying Bitcoin for their treasury is a trend that gained significant traction in recent years, largely popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. The rationale often cited includes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin serves as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets due to its decentralized nature and finite supply. Potential Appreciation: Anticipating significant future price appreciation for Bitcoin, which could boost the company’s balance sheet value. Strategic Alignment: Signalling innovation and forward-thinking to investors and customers, particularly relevant for tech or payment-focused companies. For BD Multimedia , a company operating in the digital payment space, integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy could also align with potential future business opportunities involving cryptocurrency payments or services. Their decision to use convertible bonds specifically for this purpose underscores a deliberate and structured approach to building their crypto reserves. The Growing Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Institutional Bitcoin Adoption refers to the increasing embrace of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by large financial institutions, corporations, and traditional investment funds. BD Multimedia’s move, while perhaps smaller in scale than some of the headline-grabbing purchases by major corporations, is another data point in this significant trend. This adoption isn’t just about buying and holding BTC on a balance sheet. It encompasses a range of activities: Treasury Management: Companies holding BTC as part of their corporate reserves (like BD Multimedia). Investment Products: Launching Bitcoin ETFs, futures, or other structured products. Service Integration: Payment processors integrating crypto options, banks offering crypto custody. Venture Capital: Investing in blockchain and crypto startups. The decision by BD Multimedia to issue convertible bonds for this specific purpose highlights a creative financing method being employed to facilitate Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . It shows that companies are finding tailored financial solutions to enter the crypto space, moving beyond simple direct cash purchases. Crafting a Corporate Crypto Strategy : What Does it Involve? BD Multimedia’s action provides a real-world example of a company executing a Corporate Crypto Strategy . Building such a strategy involves much more than just deciding to buy Bitcoin. Key considerations typically include: Defining Objectives: Why is the company acquiring crypto? Is it for treasury management, potential appreciation, future business integration, or a combination? Asset Selection: Which cryptocurrencies to acquire? While Bitcoin is the most common for treasuries due to its size and recognition, some might consider others. Acquisition Method: How will the crypto be acquired? Direct market purchases, over-the-counter (OTC) deals, using specific financing tools like convertible bonds , or accepting crypto payments? Custody and Security: How will the acquired crypto be securely stored? This is a critical operational challenge requiring robust security protocols and potentially third-party custodians. Accounting and Reporting: How will the crypto holdings be accounted for on the balance sheet? This involves navigating complex and evolving accounting standards. Regulatory Compliance: Understanding and adhering to relevant regulations regarding crypto holdings and transactions in their operating jurisdictions. Risk Management: Developing strategies to manage the inherent volatility and other risks associated with cryptocurrency. For BD Multimedia , their strategy clearly involved using a specific financing tool ( convertible bonds ) to fund their acquisition of BTC, indicating a carefully considered approach to both financing and asset acquisition within their broader Corporate Crypto Strategy . Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury strategy, funded potentially through mechanisms like convertible bonds , comes with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages for a company like BD Multimedia: Potential Benefits: Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, the company’s balance sheet strengthens significantly without requiring profit generation from core business operations. Inflation Hedge: May protect the purchasing power of corporate reserves against inflation over the long term. Diversification: Adds a non-correlated asset (historically, though this can change) to the corporate balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation Signal: Positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in the digital age. Attracting Talent/Investors: May appeal to employees and investors interested in the crypto space. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can be extremely volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of the corporate treasury and potential impairment losses on financial statements. Accounting Complexity: Current accounting rules often treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, requiring mark-to-market adjustments only downwards (impairment losses), which can impact reported earnings negatively during price downturns. Gains are typically only recognized upon sale. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires sophisticated security measures to prevent theft or loss of private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view holding volatile assets like Bitcoin as risky or speculative, potentially impacting investor confidence. BD Multimedia’s use of convertible bonds adds another layer of complexity, requiring careful management of the bondholders’ potential conversion rights alongside the management of the volatile BTC asset. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Going Forward? The action taken by BD Multimedia , leveraging convertible bonds to fund their Bitcoin Treasury , serves as a practical illustration of how companies are finding innovative ways to participate in the crypto market. It suggests that the trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is not limited to the largest corporations or the most obvious tech companies. Smaller to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies from diverse sectors, including traditional financial services adjacent areas like payment processing, are exploring and implementing strategies to incorporate Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. The use of specific financial instruments like convertible bonds demonstrates a growing sophistication in how these companies are approaching their Corporate Crypto Strategy . While $1.14 million may not seem massive compared to multi-billion dollar corporate treasuries, every such move adds to the cumulative weight of institutional interest and capital flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class being considered by corporate finance departments, not just speculative retail investors. Actionable Insights from BD Multimedia’s Move For investors and other companies watching this space, BD Multimedia’s strategy offers a few key takeaways: Look Beyond the Headlines: Significant institutional adoption is happening at various scales and across different sectors, not just the biggest names. Understand the ‘How’: Companies are using diverse and sometimes complex financial tools (like convertible bonds ) to fund their crypto strategies. Understanding these methods provides deeper insight into their commitment and approach. Corporate Treasuries as a Growth Driver: The trend of companies building a Bitcoin Treasury remains a potential long-term driver of demand for BTC. Due Diligence is Key: For investors interested in companies holding crypto, it’s crucial to understand their specific Corporate Crypto Strategy , including their acquisition methods, custody solutions, and risk management practices. BD Multimedia’s decision provides a tangible example of how a company is actively managing its balance sheet to gain exposure to Bitcoin, highlighting the practical implementation of a Corporate Crypto Strategy in the current market environment. Conclusion: Another Piece in the Puzzle of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption BD Multimedia’s issuance of $1.14 million in convertible bonds with the explicit goal of boosting its Bitcoin Treasury is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a clear signal of intent. It underscores the ongoing trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and showcases how companies are leveraging specific financial instruments to execute their Corporate Crypto Strategy . While the amount may be modest compared to some other corporate holdings, this move by a French payment solutions provider highlights the broadening appeal of Bitcoin as a treasury asset across different industries and geographies. It reinforces the narrative that companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate component of a modern corporate balance sheet strategy, potentially offering benefits like inflation hedging and long-term value appreciation, despite the inherent volatility and challenges.

The attack, which occurred on June 18, 2025, saw malicious actors exploit a16z’s 850,000-follower account to falsely announce the launch of an official “$a16z” token, complete with contract addresses and claims that the move represented “ a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto . ” Source: X Post The fraudulent token experienced a brief pump before crashing nearly 90% in a classic pump-and-dump pattern. A16z quickly dismissed the incident with characteristic wit, apologizing for “ any confusion caused by the clowns who temporarily took over our account .” Earlier today, our X account was briefly compromised. During that time, the account promoted a token and other fake content — none of which originated from a16z. Apologies for any confusion caused by the clowns who temporarily took over our account. — a16z (@a16z) June 18, 2025 The a16z breach represents just the latest incident in an escalating wave of cryptocurrency-focused social media attacks that have targeted everyone from venture capital firms to government officials throughout 2025. a16z X Account Hackers: The Anatomy of a Modern Crypto Hack Campaign The a16z attack follows a sophisticated playbook that has become increasingly common among crypto-focused cybercriminals. It involves creating fake tokens paired with authoritative announcements from compromised high-profile accounts. After taking over the account, the hackers crafted messages that mimicked legitimate corporate communications while including technical details like contract addresses to enhance credibility. The choice to target a16z is strategic, as the venture capital firm’s endorsement of any crypto project would carry significant weight given their reputation as kingmakers in the space. The broader pattern of attacks reveals coordinated efforts targeting various segments of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, from government officials to media outlets to development teams. Paraguay says @SantiPenap ’s account was hacked to falsely announce Bitcoin Legal Tender and solicit BTC. @PresidenciaPy has confirmed the post is fake and investigators are working with X security. #Bitcoin #Paraguay #Cybersecurity https://t.co/yduO5vGW9k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 Most recently, Paraguay President Santiago Peña’s account was compromised . It falsely announced Bitcoin adoption and included requests for users to send Bitcoin to determine the “national rollout scale.” Similarly, the ZKsync breach combined fake regulatory warnings with phishing attempts , as the hackers layered multiple attack vectors to maximize market manipulation and direct theft opportunities. The technical execution of these attacks often involves compromised delegated accounts or sophisticated phishing operations that bypass two-factor authentication, as evidenced by Watcher.Guru’s breach despite their “extreme measures” to prevent such incidents. The cross-platform nature of modern social media operations means that a single account compromise can automatically propagate fraudulent content across multiple channels. This interconnected vulnerability explains why even brief compromises can generate substantial trading volumes and market movements before being detected and reversed. Escalating Security Crisis Across Crypto Social Media The frequency and sophistication of cryptocurrency-focused social media attacks have reached crisis levels. In February 2025 alone, crypto ecosystem losses increased by 20x month-over-month to over $1.5 billion across just nine major incidents. Over $180M was stolen in March, $92M in April , and $302M in May . In Q1 alone, over $1.64 billion was recorded in the first three months of 2025 , although most resulted from only two hacks of two centralized exchanges, Bybit’s $1.46 billion hack and Phemex’s $69.1 million hack . A recent report also shows that Ethereum remains the most targeted chain, with over $1.5B recorded in Q1. Source: MartyParty on X The attacks have evolved from simple phishing attempts to complex market manipulation schemes that combine fake regulatory announcements, fraudulent airdrops, and pump-and-dump token launches. The targeting of prominent figures extends beyond cryptocurrency-specific accounts to include luxury brands like Dior, whose Instagram account was used to promote fake Solana tokens, and news outlets like the New York Post . The pattern suggests organized groups with sophisticated technical capabilities and detailed knowledge of the cryptocurrency market’s information dependencies. These groups consistently target accounts whose endorsements would carry maximum credibility and market impact.

2025-06-19T12:37:22,"Bitcoin Price Eyes Bullish Breakout as Fed Holds Rates Steady, Says CryptoQuant","Bitcoin could be preparing for a bullish breakout following the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, according to a new report from onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin is showing bullish signs as the Fed holds interest rates steady, historically a positive macro signal. CryptoQuant highlights a divergence between stable BTC price and falling open interest, suggesting a healthy market reset. Growing ask liquidity near $106K raises the potential for a short squeeze if momentum builds. In a June 19 post , CryptoQuant pointed to emerging tailwinds for BTC after the Fed’s June 18 policy meeting, where officials unanimously voted to pause further hikes. Historically, such pauses have benefited Bitcoin, and analysts believe 2025 may offer favorable conditions for risk assets. CryptoQuant Flags Divergence Between Bitcoin Price and Open Interest on Binance CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha highlighted trading data from Binance showing diverging trends between BTC price and open interest (OI). “BTC has formed consistent equal lows slightly above $104,000. This level has acted as a strong demand zone, repeatedly absorbing sell pressure,” Taha wrote. At the same time, open interest on Binance has been making lower lows, suggesting a steady round of deleveraging in the derivatives market. This type of shakeout, price holding while OI declines, is often seen as a signal that weaker positions are being cleared, potentially paving the way for more stable upward movement. “The timing of this cleanup coincides with the Fed’s decision to pause rate hikes — a macroeconomic signal that often acts as a tailwind for risk-on assets like Bitcoin,” the firm noted. Speaking after the Fed kept interest rate unchanged, Powell kept it cool and cautious: no hawkish or dovish tilt. Just a “wait and see” vibe amid rising uncertainty. Markets took it calmly. But as open interest is dropping while $BTC holds above demand, bears might be running… pic.twitter.com/5gsK5QTwPY — COIN360 (@COIN360com) June 19, 2025 In past cycles, Bitcoin has shown bullish behavior following rate stabilization , especially when open interest fades and liquidation activity slows. That backdrop, paired with strong price support, gives analysts reason to watch closely for upside movement. Data from CoinGlass adds to the bullish narrative. The platform reports growing ask liquidity near the $106,000 level, which could trigger a short squeeze if buying accelerates. While BTC continues to trade in a narrow range, the combination of macro stability and onchain cleanup suggests a potential shift in momentum may be approaching. Bitcoin is in the Consolidation Phase Bitcoin is consolidating just below the $105,000 mark , trading around $104,900 at the time of writing. The price action suggests a neutral-to-slightly bullish setup, supported by tight Bollinger Bands and steady RSI values. On the 2-hour chart, BTC has maintained higher lows near $104,000, forming a consistent demand zone. RSI is hovering near 48, indicating balanced momentum with no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. MACD, while still negative, shows signs of flattening, hinting at a possible shift in short-term trend. The 30-minute chart reinforces this view, with RSI near 51 and MACD showing a modest positive crossover. Bollinger Bands remain relatively tight, suggesting price is coiling ahead of a potential move. In the 1-minute chart, short-term momentum remains weak. RSI at 38.26 and a flat MACD reflect lackluster intraday interest. Price is compressing between $104,864 and $104,999, with minimal volatility during the observed period. Overall, BTC appears to be in a consolidation phase with a bullish bias. A decisive break above $105,500 could signal momentum toward $107K, while holding $104K remains key for bullish continuation. Short squeeze potential may increase if spot volume rises near resistance levels.

2025-06-19T12:31:03,"ChatGPT Bullish on $XRP and $SHIB – But Snorter Token Emerges as the Next Big Trading Bot","ChatGPT has predicted the end-of-year prices of three major cryptocurrencies: XRP, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoin Cash. The AI chatbot believes that $XRP can hit a high of $15, almost 600% up from its current price of $2.15. This could be thanks to increasing $XRP adoption and possible ETF approvals. Recently, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved the launch of a spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Also, the SEC is expected to approve an $XRP ETF in the US as well. Plus, around 2,700 wallets now hold more than 1M $XRP , which is the highest level of adoption seen to date. This shows increasing global corporate interest in the Ripple-based payment crypto. Keep reading to find out GPT’s predictions for the other two tokens, our take on its predictive abilities, and why, despite being a good option for research, it doesn’t stack up to trading tools like Snorter Token , arguably the most powerful sniping bot on the market. ChatGPT on Shiba Inu & Bitcoin Cash ChatGPT believes Shiba may hit $0.00008–$0.00012 by the end of the year. The asset is currently trading at $0.00001160 , which means it would see a 10x rise according to GPT’s prediction. While it may seem steep, increasing adoption of Shiba’s Layer 2 solution, Shibarium, alongside token burn events may propel the coin to new highs. On the other hand, GPT has made a more modest prediction for Bitcoin Cash ($BCH), expecting it to reach around $1,200-$1,500 by the end of 2025, a 3x increase from the current price of $464 . $BCH has already moved more than 30% in the last 2 months, showing good bullish momentum. So, it’s absolutely possible for the asset to close the year somewhere near to ChatGPT’s predictions. While the predicted numbers may seem outrageous to some, they aren’t exactly unfathomable. Crypto markets are known for their crazy directional moves, and with several bullish legislative and institutional signals flaring up, ChatGPT’s predictions may prove to be pretty accurate. Here’s the kicker: while ChatGPT can provide pretty educated price analysis based on current market trends and sentiment, it can’t execute trades on your behalf, let alone keep you safe from any dangers that come with trading meme coins. That’s where Snorter Bot, powered by the Snorter Token , becomes a sight to behold. What is Snorter Token? Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the crypto behind Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-based trading bot that aims to provide retail meme coin degens a level playing field alongside whales and institutions. Snorter’s biggest selling point stands in its advanced trading tools and its ability to snipe the best meme coins as soon as they’re listed on exchanges. This is a game-changing feature because early snipes are usually the ones that capture massive gains before the broader market tags along. Another huge benefit of using Snorter Bot is low trading fees. Unlike the competition, such as Banana Gun and Bonk Bot, which charge a minimum of 1%, Snorter Bot clamps it down to just 0.85%. Thanks to this, you’ll retain more of your profits when trading. How Snorter Bot Keeps You Safe from Scams and Attacks Snorter Bot’s security is top of the ladder, too. For starters, your swaps are routed through a private Solana RPC infrastructure, which ensures priority execution and front-running protection. Additionally, the bot will protect you against honeypots and scams by checking every token before allowing trades. It will automatically block those that exhibit signs of malicious activity. Snorter Bot also uses MEV-resistant relays, which will safeguard you against sandwich attacks. For those unaware, sandwich attacks are incredibly dangerous and used by malicious actors to exploit price slippage, which ends up costing you more per transaction. Is $SNORT the Best Crypto to Buy Now? According to our $SNORT price prediction , the Snorter Token could be the next crypto to explode , seeing as it’s expected to surge 3,290% and reach $3.25 by 2030. Much of this growth is down to Snorter’s trading features and tight security, which will keep the $SNORT token in high demand. However, we must also consider the potential of the overall crypto trading bot market. It was valued at a whopping $1.2B in 2023 . More importantly for our analysis, it’s expected to reach $4.5B by 2030, with a CAGR of 15.6%. Another reason for Snorter’s exponential growth would be its Telegram roots. After all, it’s an insanely popular platform among traders, who make up a fair chunk to its 950M active monthly users . So, in addition to giving you access to one of the best trading bots going around, buying $SNORT could also prove to be a good crypto flip once the token presale ends. Because the Snorter Token is currently in presale, prices are still low. One token sells for just $0.0957, and the project has so far raised over $1.1M in early investor funding. To learn more about the project, check out its whitepaper . You can also join its X and Instagram channels for regular updates and communication.

2025-06-19T12:30:09,"The Pacific island nation of Nauru passes crypto legislation","The Republic of Nauru, a remote island nation in the western Pacific Ocean, has passed a law that could transform the country into a regional hub for crypto, digital banking, and Web3 innovation. On Tuesday, Nauru’s Parliament approved a bill establishing the Command Ridge Virtual Asset Authority (CRVAA), a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing virtual asset services and enforcing the country’s licensing framework. The bill is Nauru’s most significant move yet toward institutionalizing digital finance. CRVAA to oversee digital asset services Named after the island’s highest elevation, the Command Ridge Virtual Asset Authority will become the primary regulatory authority for all digital asset-related activities in the country. According to the government statement issued on July 17, the CRVAA will license and supervise virtual asset service providers (VASPs), digital banking operations, and Web3 services. The new law covers both centralized and decentralized digital finance ecosystems. Activities subject to CRVAA authorization include the operation of exchanges, custodial and non-custodial wallet services, token issuance through ICOs and STOs, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lending and staking protocols, DeFi platforms, and stablecoin issuance. It also extends to digital banking operations, cross-border payments, and the issuance and management of electronic money. With the legislation in place, companies licensed under CRVAA will be allowed to operate globally while using Nauru as their jurisdictional base. Minister Eoe: Nauru is competitive in the digital economy Commerce and Foreign Investment Minister Maverick Eoe presented the bill to lawmakers and framed it as a calculated bid to compete globally. He said the law introduces a framework that puts Nauru in the list of “forward-thinking countries” already generating revenue through virtual assets and digital innovation. “ More countries are recognizing the potential of virtual assets from blockchain technologies to decentralized finance ,” Eoe reckoned. “ This bill proposes to introduce a framework that will put Nauru on par with other countries leading in the development of their digital economies .” He added that the licensing system could attract international businesses, encourage investment, and stimulate local job creation through digital sectors. “ By regulating VASPs, token issuance, and secure digital transactions, we can position Nauru as a hub for these types of innovation and development within this part of the world ,” the minister surmised. The legislation, he continued, goes beyond compliance or legal frameworks. “ It is a commitment to the future prosperity of the country and a statement that Nauru does not fear the digital transformation, but embraces it and leads within the Pacific region ,” he concluded. Legal clarity for crypto in one of the world’s smallest nations Before the bill’s passage, crypto trading in Nauru was legal but lacked formal regulation or oversight. The new legislation now defines digital assets as commodities rather than securities. Payment tokens are explicitly excluded from investment contract status, giving legal certainty to blockchain applications. The small island country, measuring just 21 square kilometers with a population of approximately 12,500, is the third-smallest country in the world by area and the world’s smallest island nation . Nauru’s government is using its legislative flexibility to become a significant player in the global digital economy. President David Adeang described the law as a “leap toward economic modernization” and resilience. In his address following the bill’s approval, Adeang said, “ The law harnesses the potential of virtual assets to diversify revenue streams and fortify economic resilience. ” The president also mentioned that Nauru is among the Pacific’s most vulnerable nations, owing to its designation under the United Nations Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI), which tracks susceptibility to economic and environmental shocks.

2025-06-19T12:30:02,"Bitcoin Mood Hits April Low as Santiment Hints at Contrarian Rally","Crypto traders have been gripped by fresh pessimism as Bitcoin’s market sentiment plunges to its most bearish reading since early April. However, according to market intelligence platform Santiment, this very gloom could set the stage for an unexpected rally, echoing a familiar pattern where deep fear turns into the fuel for Bitcoin’s next push up the price ladder. Sentiment Mirrors April Lows Fresh data from Santiment shows that for the first time in over two months, bearish comments on social media slightly outnumber bullish ones, with a ratio of 1.03 negative takes for every positive one. “This is typically a bullish sign,” stated the on-chain analytics firm. The last time such a scenario played out, fears over new punitive tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration on numerous U.S. trade partners dragged BTC below $75,000. But while sentiment flipped sharply negative, the king cryptocurrency quickly rebounded once anxiety peaked. Pointing to that April low as a textbook example of contrarian signals, Santiment declared , “markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” This latest mood dip comes at a time when macro tensions are unsettling traders. Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. reported that European equity markets had opened lower amid mounting geopolitical risks, including possible U.S. military action against Iran. Furthermore, while the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, as had been largely expected, the news was delivered alongside a cautious outlook. The Fed upgraded its inflation forecast to 3%, cut its 2025 GDP projection to 1.4%, and is facing ongoing public criticism from President Trump, adding layers of uncertainty. Price Holding Steady Bitcoin’s price, hovering around $104,800 at this writing, reflects this stagnation, showing minimal reaction to the Fed remarks. The asset lost just 0.3% of its value in the last 24 hours, with the only sign of wear coming from a 2.8% drop over the past seven days, slightly worse than the broader crypto market’s 2% loss in that period. Adler expressed more pessimism, pointing out that Bitcoin, which is currently considered a risk asset, could face accelerated selling pressure if Middle East tensions worsen and trigger a flight to safer havens. Technical voices such as Ed_NL also warned that the asset could still revisit key lower levels, with a possible double correction pattern echoing the chop from the summer of 2024. Looking at the bigger picture, however, fundamentals remain supportive. On June 18, Fidelity reported that the ancient, long-unmoved Bitcoin supply continues to grow faster than new issuance, highlighting strong holder conviction despite near-term jitters. Meanwhile, institutional appetite is also showing few signs of cooling, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1.4 billion in fresh inflows over the past week.

2025-06-19T12:20:27,"Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet: What Low BTC Fees Mean for Miners","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet: What Low BTC Fees Mean for Miners Have you sent a Bitcoin transaction lately? If so, you might have noticed something different: the cost was likely very low. Indeed, Bitcoin transaction fees have recently dropped to levels not seen since 2022. This significant decline has caught the attention of market observers and, more importantly, has a direct impact on the economics of the Bitcoin network, particularly for those who secure it. Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Fees and Miner Revenue Before diving into the specifics of the current low fee environment, it’s crucial to understand how BTC fees work and their role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. When you send Bitcoin, you include a small fee with the transaction. This fee is paid to the Bitcoin miners who include your transaction in a block they successfully add to the blockchain. Miners prioritize transactions based on the fee offered – higher fees usually mean faster confirmation times, especially when the network is busy. Miner revenue comes from two primary sources: Block Subsidy: This is the reward of newly minted Bitcoin included in each block. This subsidy halves approximately every four years (the halving event). Transaction Fees: The sum of all fees from transactions included in a block. Historically, the block subsidy has been the dominant source of income for miners. However, with each halving event reducing the subsidy, transaction fees are expected to play an increasingly important role in incentivizing miners to secure the network in the long term. Why Are Bitcoin Transaction Fees So Low Right Now? According to data cited by Decrypt from Luxor’s Hashrate Index, Bitcoin transaction fees have fallen to their lowest point since 2022. The data indicates that fees have accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward so far this June. This is a stark contrast to periods of high network congestion or intense activity. Several factors contribute to this decline: Reduced Network Congestion: The primary driver of high fees is demand for limited block space. When many people are trying to send transactions simultaneously, they bid up fees to get their transactions included in the next block. Currently, demand for block space is relatively low compared to peak periods. Decreased Activity from Fee-Intensive Use Cases: Periods like the surge in Ordinals or BRC-20 token minting significantly increased network activity and competition for block space, driving fees sky-high. The current pace of such activity is more subdued. Improved Network Efficiency: Ongoing adoption of solutions like SegWit and the Lightning Network, while still growing, can help reduce the average transaction size or move transactions off the main chain, easing congestion pressure over time. The current situation reflects a period of lower intensity on the network compared to the speculative frenzy seen during certain past cycles. The Impact on Bitcoin Miner Revenue This drop in BTC fees has a direct and significant impact on Bitcoin miner revenue . While the block subsidy remains the largest component of their earnings, the contribution from fees can provide a crucial boost to profitability, especially for less efficient operations or during times of high operational costs (like electricity). Consider the revenue structure: Total Miner Revenue = Block Subsidy + Total Transaction Fees in Block When transaction fees represent less than 1% of the total block reward, it means miners are relying almost entirely on the block subsidy (currently 3.125 BTC per block after the latest halving). This makes their profitability highly sensitive to the price of Bitcoin and their operational expenses. For miners, this presents a challenge: Lower Profit Margins: With fees contributing minimally, the margin between the cost of mining (electricity, hardware, cooling, facility) and the revenue earned shrinks. Increased Pressure on Efficiency: Less profitable periods force miners to upgrade to more efficient hardware (ASICs) and seek out the lowest possible electricity costs to remain competitive. Potential for Consolidation: Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to stay afloat, potentially leading to consolidation within the industry. This isn’t the first time fees have been low, and it highlights the dynamic nature of Bitcoin mining economics. Miners are accustomed to fluctuating revenue streams, but extended periods of low fees add considerable pressure. Comparing Current Crypto Transaction Costs From a user perspective, the low crypto transaction costs on the Bitcoin network are a positive development. Sending BTC is currently cheaper and faster than it might be during peak congestion times. This makes smaller transactions more viable and improves the overall user experience for transferring value on the base layer. How do current Bitcoin fees compare to other cryptocurrencies? While direct comparisons can be complex due to different network designs and fee mechanisms, Bitcoin’s base layer fees can still become very high during peak demand. However, in the current low-congestion environment, Bitcoin transaction costs are competitive, often cheaper than sending assets on some other popular blockchains that might be experiencing higher activity or have different fee structures. It’s a reminder that the “cost” of using a blockchain isn’t static; it’s a market price determined by supply (block space) and demand (transactions waiting to be confirmed). Challenges and Actionable Insights The primary challenge highlighted by low Bitcoin transaction fees is the pressure on miner profitability. As the block subsidy continues to decrease over future halvings, the network’s security will rely more heavily on fees to incentivize mining. A prolonged period of extremely low fees in the distant future could theoretically raise questions about long-term security funding, although the network has mechanisms and market dynamics to address this over time (e.g., increased transaction volume, new fee-generating use cases, or simply a higher Bitcoin price making the reduced subsidy still valuable). For those involved: For Users: Enjoy the lower fees! It’s a good time to consolidate UTXOs or make transactions you might have deferred due to high costs. For Miners: Focus on operational efficiency, secure low-cost power sources, and explore hedging strategies. Diversification into hosting services or proprietary trading operations can also help stabilize Bitcoin miner revenue . The market is cyclical, and fee revenue is one of the more volatile components of the mining business. What Could Change the Fee Landscape? Several factors could lead to an increase in BTC fees : Increased Bitcoin Price: A significant rally could attract more users and transaction volume. Resurgence of Fee-Intensive Activity: A new wave of interest in Ordinals, BRC-20s, or other similar protocols could quickly congest the network again. General Market Bull Run: Increased speculative activity across the crypto market often leads to more on-chain movements on all major networks, including Bitcoin. Major Network Events: While the halving primarily impacts the subsidy, it often correlates with increased attention and potential transaction volume. Predicting transaction fees is difficult, as they are a function of organic demand and speculative use cases. However, the current low levels are likely a reflection of the broader market sentiment and reduced speculative fervor compared to previous peaks. Conclusion: A Mixed Bag for the Network The drop in Bitcoin transaction fees to their lowest point since 2022 is a notable development. On one hand, it’s a positive for users, leading to lower crypto transaction costs and making the base layer more accessible for smaller transfers. On the other hand, it presents a challenge for Bitcoin mining operations, significantly reducing their fee-based income and putting pressure on Bitcoin miner revenue . This situation underscores the dynamic and market-driven nature of the Bitcoin network. While low fees benefit users in the short term, the long-term health and security of the network rely on miners remaining profitable enough to continue dedicating computational power. The balance between block subsidy and fees is constantly evolving, and the current low fee environment is a temporary snapshot in Bitcoin’s journey.

Here's All You Need to Know…","The Fed is expected to resume the interest rate cuts it paused in order to ignite a new rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. However, despite the positive economic data, the FED has kept interest rates constant since January due to the uncertainty created by the tariffs. While the Fed is determined to keep interest rates steady until it provides more clarity, US President Donald Trump frequently pressures the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Trump even wants Powell to resign from his position as FED chairman. At this point, Trump called on the FED to cut interest rates even before the June FED decision announced yesterday. However, the FED again ignored Trump and left interest rates unchanged. Trump, who was very angry about this situation, posted on his Truth Scoial account, harshly criticizing Powell for yesterday's decision and calling for her resignation. Donald Trump criticized Jerome Powell on Truth Social, saying: “Too Late. Powell is the worst. And a true idiot who is costing the US billions of dollars.” He also shared an article calling for Powell to resign from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest mortgage lenders. Trump argues that interest rates should be cut now that economic data is good, and has repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Related News: BREAKING! Surprise New Move from Donald Trump!

The opposition, which sought to topple the government a few months ahead of the parliamentary elections this fall, continues to push for more resignations. Fiala’s government gathers enough votes to stay in power The ruling center-right coalition in the Czech Republic rejected an attempt in parliament to bring down the cabinet of Petr Fiala, who has been trying hard to counter the political fallout from a controversial cryptocurrency donation. The scandal already led to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek earlier in June, who took responsibility for his department’s decision to accept 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in Bitcoin from a convicted drug dealer. The no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czech parliament, was initiated by the main opposition ANO party. The right-wingers were supported by the far-right SPD and the Pirates but fell short of the 101 votes needed. All parties forming the Fiala government – his conservative ODS, the centrist STAN, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL), and the liberal-conservative TOP 09, largely backed the cabinet, with only a few absences and abstentions, Euractiv noted in a report. Of the 192 members of parliament present during the session on Wednesday, 94 opposition deputies backed the motion while 98 representatives of the ruling majority opposed it, the national radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas broke down the numbers . “We have just had another vote of no-confidence in the government. It went as expected and the government survived the vote,” Petr Fiala commented on X. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala updates that his administration survived a no-confidence vote over a $45 million BTC donation. Source: Petr Fiala Prime Minister’s party damaged by crypto donation scandal Pavel Blažek stepped down in May after reports emerged that the Ministry of Justice took a donation of 480 BTC from Tomáš Jiřikovský, the operator of a darknet market who had been convicted of drug trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal arms possession. Jiřikovský had served four years in prison. Both Blažek and the Czech prime minister admitted that accepting the Bitcoin without proper verification of its source was a “mistake” and “ethically problematic.” Blazek apologized for his role in the case but rejected accusations of corruption. The scandal has impacted Fiala’s Civic Democrats while the other parties in the coalition have been distancing themselves from the affair, which, according to the opposition, undermined public trust in state institutions and stained the country’s reputation abroad. Coalition partner Mayors and Independents (STAN), who criticized the way Petr Fiala handled the matter, eventually backed his administration, after warning about political instability if the government falls before the upcoming elections in October. Earlier, they had demanded that the new Justice Minister Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s ODS party, provide a detailed description of how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the ministry and identify all responsible persons. She promised an independent audit as part of a full investigation. Opposition ANO party insists on finance minister’s resignation The right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Czech Prime Minister and businessman Andrej Babiš, has made it clear it will continue to push for the resignation of Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, despite the government surviving the vote of no-confidence. ANO claims that Stanjura is a key figure in the Bitcoin scandal, as he should have notified the Czech Republic’s Financial Analytical Office and called for a meeting of the National Security Council as soon as he learned about the suspicious crypto donation. Zbyněk Stanjura has already refused to quit his seat. About two weeks ago, he insisted he had not violated the law, maintaining that the Ministry of Justice was solely responsible for the embarrassing affair. While stressing his department was not involved in the decision to accept the cryptocurrency, the finance minister admitted he had been aware of Blažek’s intentions to accept the digital coin donation and even tried to talk him out of it.

An ascending trendline from December 2024 has also been capping gains for weeks. These levels are proving tough to clear. If Bitcoin can’t break through soon, sellers may step in. Faibik points out that hitting these walls and seeing RSI divergence at the same time often marks the high point before a drop. This Activity Points To Caution The derivatives market adds another layer to the story. Trading volume in Bitcoin futures and options rose by 1.60%, taking total activity to around $100 billion. Open interest, meanwhile, slid down 1.30% to nearly $70 billion. This suggests some players are closing their bets rather than piling on new ones. In the past 24 hours, liquidations have wiped out $71 million in long positions. That kind of pain can trigger more sell‑offs if people rush to protect their profits.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 320,800 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ) appears to have completed an ABC correction on the eight-hour chart, suggesting that the coin has printed a durable bottom. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset is primed to ignite rallies after completing an ABC correction. “Perfect SPX pullback here after testing prior all-time high for the first time, the next test blasts through in my opinion, still one of the best charts [with a] less than $1billy (billion) market cap in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests SPX increase to $2.10. SPX is trading for $1.47 at time of writing, up 17.5% in the last 24 hours. The analyst is also bullish on the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project ai16z ( AI16Z ). According to Bluntz, the altcoin appears to be entering an uptrend after a retest of the Fibonacci retracement level at $0.16. Traders use the Fibonacci retracement tool to spot potential entry and exit points based on the Fibonacci ratio. “Long ai16z again here was one leg too early the other week, but looking like a strong reaction from the 0.78 fib here and still looks like a clear five up and subsequent abc correction.

2025-06-19T11:40:37,"Bank of Korea warns that local stablecoins will increase dollar dependence","The Governor of South Korea’s central bank, Rhee Chang-yong, said he is concerned about the country’s early-stage explorations of Korean won-pegged stablecoins, saying they could induce more demand for the U.S. dollar. He noted that this could pose challenges for the central bank in overseeing foreign exchange. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Rhee said issuing won stablecoins may not reduce the use of dollar stablecoins, but rather facilitate the exchange between dollar stablecoins and won stablecoins, which may increase the demand for dollar stablecoins. However, his warning clashed with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung’s agenda to promote won-pegged stablecoins, mainly to prevent capital flight. The ruling Democratic Party proposed earlier this month that the Digital Asset Basic Act, designed to set up regulatory infrastructure, needs to allow local companies to issue won-denominated stablecoins. President Lee appointed Kim Yong-beom, a former crypto firm chief, as his chief policy officer in his first week in office, further boosting speculation that the government would allow issuance of stablecoins backed by the Korean won. Rhee says he is not against the issuance of a won-backed stablecoin Rhee pointed out that he is not opposed to the issuance of a Korean won-pegged stablecoin and, in fact, saw a need for it. However, he added that the impact of such a stablecoin on the monetary system would depend on the form of issuance and the type of assets backing it. Governor Rhee also pointed out that allowing non-banking institutions to issue won-based stablecoins freely could seriously weaken monetary policy. An official from a local commercial lender also said stablecoins are not yet lucrative for banks. But if the won-based stablecoin materialized, banks would, of course, want to play a central role. The proposed stablecoin seeks to reduce reliance on dollar-backed stablecoins, which the Bank of Korea said reached $41.6 billion (56.95 trillion won) on Korea’s five major cryptocurrency exchanges– Upbit , Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone, and Gopax–in Q1 2025, marking a threefold increase from 17.06 trillion won in the third quarter of 2024. An official from the BOK also said the issuance of stablecoins could increase the money supply and potentially affect the status of the won. The official reportedly said it was necessary to approach the matter cautiously, adding that another potential loophole lay in cross-border transactions, possibly threatening the country’s financial stability. South Korea pushes stablecoin bill under new president South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung, is moving fast on campaign pledges as the ruling Democratic Party proposed the Digital Asset Basic Act, which was announced on Tuesday to issue local stablecoins. The bill aims to improve transparency and boost competition within the crypto sector. The move also came as stablecoin trading in South Korea surged, reaching 57 trillion won in Q1 alone. Under the proposed law, South Korean firms could issue stablecoins if they held at least 500 million won in equity capital. These issuers must maintain sufficient reserves and gain approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, Governor Rhee voiced opposition, warning that private stablecoins could undermine the central bank’s control over monetary policy. President Lee’s push for broader crypto integration also included proposals for the national pension fund to invest in Bitcoin and permitting Bitcoin ETFs. Governor Rhee said the central bank would work with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Financial Services Commission to establish appropriate measures as soon as possible. “We would need to consider the broader implications for bank profitability and structural changes if payment and settlement functions — traditionally handled by banks — are expanded to the non-banking sector.” – Rhee Chang-yong , Governor of the Bank of Korea (BoK) The central bank argued that it should lead in regulating a local currency stablecoin. Additionally, establishing a committee to guide crypto policy will ensure the regulatory framework is comprehensive and practical. It will promote the use of digital assets while protecting consumers and ensuring the financial system’s stability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-19T11:34:18,"Monster $1.5 billion Solana short squeeze alert","Solana ( SOL ) is trading at $145.50, but under the surface, tension is building across derivatives markets. The latest 30-day Solana Exchange Liquidation Map from Coinglass shows an escalating wave of short-side leverage clustered just above current price, setting the stage for a potential $1.5 billion short squeeze if bulls push the token beyond its immediate resistance zone. At first glance, the setup looks eerily similar to what we’ve seen with Bitcoin and XRP in recent weeks: a rising cumulative short liquidation curve (green), bar clusters thick with high-leverage shorts, and a flatlining long liquidation zone (red), suggesting asymmetrical risk. But Solana’s chart takes it up a notch. A closer look at Solana’s Liquidation Map The liquidation map reveals that short positions start building heavily from around $146, just a dollar above the current price. From there, the green curve steepens dramatically through $150, $155, and all the way to $170, indicating a parabolic rise in short liquidation leverage. Solana Exchange Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass This buildup tells us one thing: traders across Binance , OKX, and especially Bybit have aggressively shorted Solana between $146 and $170, expecting a local top or pullback. But if price begins to climb through that zone, those short positions begin to auto-liquidate, triggering forced buybacks and sending the price higher in a feedback loop. The largest liquidation clusters appear between $150 and $163, with some single levels showing more than $60–75 million in exposure, mostly on Bybit. That suggests retail and aggressive leverage traders have entered positions with tight stops and high risk profiles. Why this setup matters With low spot volume and thinning resistance levels, it doesn’t take much to push SOL into a zone where shorts get flushed out rapidly. If Solana can break and hold above $146–$148, a chain reaction becomes likely. The liquidation map shows no significant resistance zones above that level until the mid-$160s. That gives SOL at least $15–20 of clean air before encountering serious sell pressure, plenty of room for liquidation-fueled price expansion. On the flip side, failure to break above $146 could embolden bears. But with short exposure this elevated, a downside rejection becomes less sustainable because it would mean millions of dollars in still-open shorts remain vulnerable to even minor bullish spikes.

Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is fueled by steady gains and growing institutional interest. With blue-chip cryptos setting the pace, attention is shifting toward top tokens only where explosive returns are possible, enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral DeFi token and poised for a 44x rally before summer ends. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. The Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,200 investors. More than $10.8 million has been raised. For traders asking what crypto to buy in 2025 or what to buy before June ends, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer stability, but the real FOMO is building around that under‑the‑radar altcoin that’s ready to skyrocket. Ethereum Consolidates Near $2,625 Amid Bullish Setup Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,625, having seen a 0.04% uptick from the previous session. Price action shows ETH in a tight range between $2,550–$2,700 as the market digests the impact of the May Pectra upgrade and fluctuating ETF inflows, which have notably bolstered Ethereum’s appeal in the institutional market. Technical indicators suggest a moderate bullish outlook, with key support at $2,553 and resistance near $2,589; a decisive breakout above could pave the way toward the $2,800–$2,900 zone this month. Meanwhile, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remain on the radar for traders seeking diversified upside. Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $10.8M with Over 12,200 Early Backers Mutuum Finance is making waves across the DeFi market, raising more than $10.8 million and attracting over 12,200 investors in its ongoing presale. This rapid momentum reflects growing confidence in the project’s long-term vision and disruptive potential. Currently in its fifth presale phase, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03, but that won’t last long. The upcoming sixth round will raise the token price to $0.035. For early participants, the current price offers a potential 100% return when the token launches at $0.006. Redefining DeFi: Mutuum’s Two-Tier Lending Approach Mutuum Finance isn’t just another DeFi project, it’s building a smarter, more flexible lending ecosystem through its dual-lending model, combining ease of use with investor control: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): On P2C, users deposit USDT into smart contracts which earn them stable and passive revenue, and are suited to anyone who wants to earn money without playing a role. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): A more sophisticated user can lend directly according to the individual terms, ideal due to its high volatility of the assets and self-made lending agreements. This hybrid method offers the users both a good return and complete control, and all in a decentralized, safe framework. Security First: Transparent, Built To Last, and Audited Mutuum Finance is a crypto project that is unique in an environment full of dubious investments and ambiguity in governance. The platform has undergone a complete security check by Certik, one of the most defined seal of quality in blockchain security. Its infrastructure is completely transparent and uses open-source smart contracts, bringing about the reassurance that DeFi in the modern times requires. Further strengthening its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged, fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. Designed to offer lasting value and resistance to the volatility that has plagued algorithmic stablecoins, it’s a major step toward long-term stability and institutional adoption. Bitcoin eyes $110K, Ethereum trends upward, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. With $10.8M raised from over 12,200 investors, MUTM is priced at $0.03 and launching at $0.06, offering 100% gains.

While expectations for a new ATH in BTC continue, CryptoQuant analyst stated that there is a strong potential growth signal for Bitcoin for the rest of 2025. Accordingly, CryptoQuant analyst said that the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend points to new rallies and ATH for BTC. Citing historical data, the analyst said that when looking at Bitcoin's performance since 2011, BTC has followed a certain predictable trend. Bitcoin Experiences Three Years of Boom, One Year of Consolidation! The analyst noted that, according to this historical trend, every three years of growth in Bitcoin is followed by a year of consolidation. At this point, Bitcoin is in the third year of a three-year growth trend. Given historical data, the analyst argued that if Bitcoin reflects its typical third-year momentum, it could surge as much as 120% and potentially reach $205,000 by the end of the year. “Bitcoin Annual Percentage Trend provides insight into Bitcoin's movements. This reveals a repeating cycle of three years of growth followed by a consolidation cycle, which matches Bitcoin’s four-year halving rhythm. The significance of this growth cycle is that based on this metric, if Bitcoin maintains its typical third-year pace in the cycle, it could grow by around 120% through 2025. Starting at $93,226, this will take the price to $205,097, potentially marking the top of the cycle for this year. If this trend holds true once again, 2025 is likely to close as the third consecutive year of increases, thus completing another positive cycle.” *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Dominance Holds Back the Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The sentiment around Altcoin season odds has thinned more than ever, as markets are pulling back as geopolitical stress ramps up, and market participants on this are clearly uneasy. Several disastrous headlines sparked sharp reactions, especially across the altcoin sector. While the top cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum are seeing increased sell pressure in the short-term, as capital looks for safety elsewhere. As people panicking, most recently, an expert, Mister Crypto, addressed a relief statement on X that altseason has not been cancelled yet, but in fact, it has been delayed. He optimistically said that once it starts, people holding potential altcoins will get rich for sure. People have agreed with the experts’ post and added that the longer it coils, the more violent the breakout will be. Bitcoin Is The Reason Altcoin season Could Be Delayed Mister crypto said that global liquidity is exploding, and Bitcoin price seems to be following it. Meanwhile, BTC continues to enjoy institutional interest and publicly traded companies having Bitcoin on their balance sheet has jumped 2.3x from 2024. As per the Blockware chart , the number has jumped more than 150. Alongside this the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail interest, keeps capital concentrated in BTC, preventing it from broadly rotating into altcoins. As a reason why, the “Altcoin Season Index” has been low, indicating a “Bitcoin Season.” Also, FOMC’s steady stance as it kept rates unchanged limits the flow to much riskier altcoins, contributing to this delay. Similarly, MAX crypto, seeing the M2 money supply chart rising, predicted that $150K could come under improved geopolitical conditions, which would definitely raise its dominance further. Bitcoin is going to $150,000 pic.twitter.com/zqJNfTR4UL — Max (@MaxCryptoxx) June 19, 2025 Likewise, the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin act from the Senate is indeed broadly bullish for the entire crypto market, but favours BTC more. As this act is increasing confidence and going to facilitate newer institutional entry by legitimizing stablecoins. This makes institutional capital and confidence flow first into Bitcoin because it is the most established and liquid crypto asset. Moreover, this concentration of new money in BTC, aligned with the several other factors mentioned, can contribute to Bitcoin’s continued dominance , thus delaying the broad capital rotation needed to fuel a widespread altcoin season.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-delayed-bitcoin-dominance-holds-back-the-rally/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Altcoins|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Demand from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is high, but on-chain data shows significant selling pressure from both long-term holders and intraday traders, keeping the market trapped in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000 . According to the blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, wallets holding BTC for under one year are at the forefront of recent profit-taking. On Monday, this group was responsible for 83% of the total realized profit, with holders in the six-to-twelve-month range alone offloading $904 million worth of bitcoin. The figure is the second-highest realized profit by this age group in 2025. Last week, we highlighted how $BTC wallets that held >12m were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. Yesterday: 🔹 🔹 6–12m holders alone realized $904M – second-highest daily profit YTD pic.twitter.com/gBD8tLCjVG — glassnode (@glassnode) June 17, 2025 The chart also shows a decline in realized profits from holders of over ten years, where the oldest addresses have exited or are choosing to remain dormant. Meanwhile, short-term holder activity, particularly in the 1w–1m and 1m–3m ranges, is still on high levels, contributing to repeated price ceilings. Short-term holders’ trading activity was at its highest earlier in the year. Yet, long-term holders, defined as those who held BTC for over one year, realized a peak of $1.2 billion in profits just last week. Profit takers cap market volatility According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, this tug-of-war between buyer demand and selling on highs is compressing volatility. “Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check,” Thielen said in a Thursday note to clients. “This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable.” CryptoQuant’s 30-day rolling chart shows net ETF inflows surged by 128,000 BTC in June, the strongest accumulation period since early 2024. The uptick precedes a more modest 36,000 BTC inflow seen in prior weeks. Binance BTC whale to exchange flow. Source: CryptoQuant However, even as ETFs absorbed vast amounts of supply, whale activity on centralized exchanges went up as well. Binance exchange reserves saw large BTC inflows from $2.3 billion to $4.59 billion in just 24 hours, coinciding with the ETF accumulation window. The simultaneous movement suggests that high-net-worth individuals, funds, or advanced trading desks were not exiting positions, but rather repositioning assets for liquidity access. Some analysts argue these inflows do not necessarily reflect bearish intent. Instead, they could be linked to market makers preparing to arbitrage between ETF pricing and spot markets. On the mining side, data from IntoTheBlock shows that the combined balance in miner wallets declined by approximately 30,000 BTC in just 20 days, dropping from 1.94 million at the end of May to 1.91 million in mid-June. According to analysts, the miners’ share of total spot volume is currently at its lowest point since 2022, which has diminished their influence on price direction. Bitcoin market conflict over purpose Alexander Blume, managing partner at SEC-registered adviser Two Prime, believes Bitcoin investors are in two minds on whether the coin is a speculative asset or a longer-term investment . “Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,” Blume said in a recent interview. “It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups.” Accumulation patterns that defined Bitcoin’s rally from $75,000 to six figures in early April have weakened. Benjamin Lilly, co-founder of Jarvis Labs, attributes this to a preference for capital-efficient strategies.

He claimed this move could help eliminate the national debt, boost the strength of the U.S. dollar, and give America a leading role in the digital financial system. His vision combined big economic goals with a powerful sense of urgency. Bitcoin Is the Future of Property Saylor explained that Bitcoin is more than just a currency – it’s a new kind of asset. Unlike land or oil, no government, company, or person can control it. He called Bitcoin “unstoppable” and said it has reached “escape velocity,” pointing to the more than $2 trillion already invested in the network. He compared the opportunity to America’s purchase of Alaska for $6 million, suggesting the U.S. could see economic benefits of $50 trillion to $80 trillion by securing a significant share of Bitcoin. U.S. Has 12 Months to Make a Move According to Saylor, the U.S. has a 12-month window to start acquiring Bitcoin reserves. But success depends on building political agreement between the White House, Congress, and other key leaders. He said that adding Bitcoin to America’s list of national assets, alongside gold, oil, and other resources, could provide powerful long-term economic protection. But the clock is ticking. China and Russia Are Already in the Race Saylor warned that if the U.S. waits too long, countries like China or Russia could step in and take control of a large portion of the Bitcoin network. That could weaken America’s position on the global stage. However, if the U.S. acts first, it could lead the way for its allies and expand its influence in the digital world. Saylor made it clear – this is not just about finance, but about national power and leadership. Bitcoin as Financial Armor for the People Saylor also spoke about Bitcoin’s value for everyday citizens, calling it “economic armor” that can offer financial freedom and protection from government overreach. His message wasn’t just for America. He recently met with top finance officials from Pakistan and expressed interest in helping other countries develop Bitcoin strategies.

2025-06-19T11:00:23,"Are Altseason Expectations Wishful Thinking? This Metric Hints So","Over the past few months, analysts have made several predictions about when the altcoin season for this cycle will begin. Most of these predictions are based on the price performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). However clear the coast may appear to be, analysts at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant think that the expectations of an altseason in this cycle may be wishful thinking. Will The Altseason Come According to a report by analyst Burak Kesmeci, altcoins are still behaving as if it were the winter season. Their poor performance has persisted regardless of bitcoin rallies and periodic price spikes. Even when BTC is enjoying a bull run, the bears have been in charge of altcoins. For this narrative to change, Kesmeci said the 1-Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins (excluding ETH) needs to shift to a positive value. The metric flipped positive in December 2024, indicating a local top for altcoins while BTC rallied. However, it has been on a negative trend since then. Currently, the 1-Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins (excluding ETH) stands at -$36 billion. The CryptoQuant analyst stated that the metric heading downhill indicates altcoin investors are missing in action – they are not trading their assets and have refrained from making any significant investments in altcoins. The metric highlighted by Kesmeci confirms that while BTC consolidates around $104,000, altcoins are still falling short of expectations. Before altcoins can experience a sustained rally, this metric needs to return to the zero range and turn positive. Unless this happens, expecting a full-blown altseason or a fear of missing out (FOMO) among altcoin investors may be just wishful thinking. Analysts Hold Onto Hope While the crypto market awaits the rise of the 1-Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins metric, experts insist that there is still hope for altcoins. Some say Ether’s next breakout could trigger an altseason, while others argue that several altseason indicators are aligning. Additionally, some analysts believe that all hope is not yet lost, as BTC still has another leg up (altcoin rallies have corresponded with BTC surges in this cycle). Meanwhile, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju thinks that only a select few will rally if an altseason happens in this cycle. This is because the dynamic of this bull season is different from past cycles. The post Are Altseason Expectations Wishful Thinking?

2025-06-19T10:55:46,"Business Leader: Stablecoins Will Make XRP Become a Neutral Bridge Asset","Jake Claver, a prominent business leader and financial strategist, has asserted that the growing prominence of stablecoins does not reduce the need for XRP. In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Claver addressed the misconception that the rise of fiat-backed and algorithmic stablecoins would diminish XRP’s utility in cross-border finance . According to Claver, that view is incorrect. He stated that the current $27 trillion locked in Nostro/Vostro accounts globally could expand to over $50 trillion, citing distrust among banks regarding the use of competing stablecoins as the primary driver for that potential increase. Claver emphasized that XRP, functioning as a neutral bridge asset , maintains its relevance because it is not issued by any specific institution or nation-state, making it a uniquely suited tool for settlement between parties that do not trust each other. People think stablecoins reduce XRP's need. Wrong. $27T in Nostro/Vostro accounts could grow to $50T+ because banks won't trust competitors' coins. XRP becomes the neutral bridge. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) June 17, 2025 Community Response Highlights Diverging Views Claver’s post attracted commentary from X users who expanded on or challenged his assertion. One user, who goes by the name Trenton valley boy, echoed Claver’s point about trust in financial counterparties. He noted that the core issue in the present financial system is the lack of trust between institutions, especially when dealing with manipulated or overinflated currencies. According to him, XRP addresses that issue through the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature, which eliminates counterparty risk by allowing for trustless liquidity provision on-chain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The user then compared Bitcoin to XRP, stating that even Bitcoin represents a form of counterparty risk due to its volatile price action and longer settlement times. He argued that the volatility during transaction finality windows can lead to significant financial impact, especially when values shift by thousands of dollars in minutes. In his view, stablecoins issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) provide a counterparty-risk-free alternative. He acknowledged that XRP itself could remain volatile, but stablecoins moving via XRPL in three to five seconds do not suffer from the same risk. He concluded by stating that the ability to recognize and act on these developments is essential to being prepared for the future of money movement. Criticism Refutes XRP Bridge Currency Narrative However, the post was not without opposition. Another user, STU, firmly disagreed with Claver’s claims. He argued that the vision of banks using XRP as a bridge currency is outdated and no longer aligns with current market dynamics. According to STU, that idea represents a belief from 2017 that never materialized at scale. He stated that no banks are currently using XRP for bridging transactions, and suggested that this was the motivation behind Ripple’s shift toward RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin . STU concluded that Ripple is now focusing on bringing volume to the XRP Ledger through the issuance of a trusted stablecoin, rather than relying on the XRP token itself as the primary utility. The broader relevance of Claver’s argument lies in the evolving architecture of international finance. With increasing regulatory clarity and emerging technologies like AMM and tokenized fiat currencies on-chain, platforms such as the XRPL continue to evolve. While some argue XRP’s original use case is no longer viable, others maintain that the system still needs a trust-minimized, efficient bridge asset.

2025-06-19T10:50:28,"CZ wants crypto platforms to add inheritance tools and minor access","Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urged crypto platforms to introduce a “will feature” that allows users to designate beneficiaries for their digital assets after death. He also called for minors to be allowed to hold accounts to receive inherited crypto funds. CZ posted on X that crypto platforms should help people plan what happens to their assets after they die. “Every platform should have a ‘will function’—so that when someone is no longer around, their assets can be distributed to designated accounts according to specified proportions.” CZ asks crypto platforms to add inheritance tools and allow minors to receive crypto CZ explained that setting up inheritance in cold or private wallets is challenging for the average user. Many people don’t know how to share private keys securely, and without a proper system, families can end up completely locked out of their assets. CZ suggested creating a simple tool where users could name their beneficiaries and define percentages of the assets each would receive to make inheritance easier, safer, and more accessible for everyone. It would also ensure that crypto doesn’t become lost forever just because someone didn’t have a plan. Many people supported the idea on X and said it was long overdue. @Ranofty commented that it was “a great idea ,” adding that planning for family members was not only smart but necessary. Another user, @Tabraiz, said CZ’s suggestion showed real responsibility and vision. They argue that every crypto holder should take estate planning seriously because more value is digitally stored today. However, the proposal also raised some concerns, as some people were uncomfortable with allowing minors to receive digital assets. @diamondhandjs disagreed with the suggestion and argued that minors should not be involved with crypto even as passive beneficiaries . They said exposing young people to them could be harmful and irresponsible because crypto platforms are like gambling environments. @lfp8023 raised doubts about how fraud and abuse could be prevented when he asked, “How does the platform even know you’re dead?” @Predator_fund warned that platforms might keep the funds by default if they don’t design clear and accessible inheritance tools. Meanwhile, a few people said crypto isn’t just about money. One user, @uniswap12, mentioned that his Binance account had social and digital value beyond just crypto holdings. The user suggested that platforms should consider letting users pass on entire accounts, including transaction history, social data, or NFTs. Reports estimate that more than $1 billion in crypto is lost yearly when users die without sharing access credentials or leaving any backup plans, and their families end up frustrated because they don’t even know the crypto exists or how to claim it. Binance introduces emergency contact and inheritance features Binance released a new platform update that included an inheritance feature on June 12, which allows users to choose and assign an emergency contact to be notified if the account remains inactive for a long time and, if necessary, request access to the crypto assets left behind. The system will automatically send alerts via email or SMS to both the user and the emergency contact to confirm they’re okay and simply taking a break if it detects extended inactivity for a certain number of days. The emergency contact can step in and submit an official inheritance request if there’s no response for an extended period. To make a claim, the emergency contact must provide supporting documents, such as a death certificate and a valid government-issued ID. Binance will manually review the request to verify the details and ensure the process is genuine. The system currently supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB).

2025-06-19T10:45:43,"XRP price prediction: analyst eyes another 600% rally, will 7-year pattern repeat?","XRP price is once again in the spotlight after prominent crypto analyst Michael XBT, who accurately forecasted its 600% rally from $0.38 to $3.40 between July 2024 and January 2025, suggested the coin may be setting up for another major breakout. His original prediction was based on a rare technical pattern called a 7-year bull pennant. Now, he’s drawing parallels with Bitcoin’s own multi-year breakout, sparking renewed interest among retail and institutional investors . XRP’s last breakout followed a multi-year formation In July 2024, XRP appeared to be in decline, shedding 25% in Q2 and hitting a yearly low of $0.38 on 5 July. At the time, trading volume was weak and investor interest was dwindling. Michael XBT spotted a long-term bullish setup known as a 7-year bull pennant — a continuation pattern in technical analysis — and publicly predicted that XRP would rally. In a tweet dated 5 July 2024, he suggested a sharp move was imminent. That forecast materialised six months later. XRP soared to $3.40 by 16 January 2025, a gain of 600% from its July lows. The move caught much of the market by surprise and re-established XRP as a key altcoin to watch in the broader crypto landscape. XRP’s current price points to consolidation phase After peaking in January, XRP price has entered a period of consolidation. It posted a 46% gain in January 2025 but followed up with declines in February (-29.3%) and March (-2.52%), a modest recovery in April (+4.98%), and relatively flat moves in May (-0.80%) and early June (-0.74%). As of 10 June 2025, XRP is trading at $2.17, down 7.5% over the past 30 days and 2.8% in the last 24 hours. On 7 April, it touched an interim low of $1.60, but has since bounced back above $2. Michael XBT has described this as a “healthy cooldown” rather than the end of the rally. He has not issued a new price target but noted similarities between XRP’s current structure and Bitcoin’s 8-year trendline breakout, which ultimately led to all-time highs. Long-term projections vary widely Analysts continue to debate XRP’s future , with price forecasts ranging from modest gains to triple-digit speculation. Some industry analysts have suggested XRP price could climb to between $5 and $30 during this market cycle, citing Ripple’s increasing partnerships and demand for cross-border payment solutions. However, more extreme projections — such as a $100 price target — are still considered unrealistic by many in the industry due to current supply dynamics and regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple. Michael XBT’s new analysis adds credibility to the view that XRP may have further room to climb, but without a specific target, investors are interpreting his remarks as directional rather than definitive. Investors focus on Ripple’s fundamentals Ripple’s expansion into institutional finance and global payment infrastructure continues to fuel optimism. The company’s ongoing push into markets across Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America has helped sustain demand for XRP even during pullbacks. At the same time, traders are closely watching XRP’s ability to hold support above $2, with $1.60 viewed as a key level. Technical traders will be looking for volume confirmation and higher highs before calling the next leg of the rally. XRP’s volatility makes it a speculative play, but with previous patterns repeating and technical sentiment leaning bullish, the crypto remains firmly on the radar of trend-following investors.

2025-06-19T10:41:36,"Worries Over Bitcoin Treasuries Grow — Can Solaxy 100x as First-Ever Solana Layer-2?","Corporate treasury strategies are entering a new era as traditional finance and crypto converge. Two standout approaches are now reshaping how institutions manage digital assets. 💡 Approach One: The well-established Bitcoin playbook – buy $BTC and hold. Borrow billions to do so if necessary. 💡 Approach Two: A bold new frontier on Solana – buy $SOL and farm yield natively through chain-on-chain treasury mechanics. Both approaches have gained significant followings in recent months, with the $SOL treasury strategy emerging more recently. And with Solaxy preparing to launch the first true Solana Layer-2, the entire Solana-native treasury model could be about to jump to light speed. Debt-Fueled Bitcoin Strategies Face Growing Scrutiny MicroStrategy, the poster child of the Bitcoin treasury movement, now holds over $62B in BTC. That’s mostly been paid for using debt, including multiple convertible bond issuances. Saylor’s been widely lauded for his approach, and the Bitcoin Strategy is now seen everywhere. But while it’s a bold strategy, serious questions are now being asked. At the DigiAssets Conference held June 17-18, Anthony Scaramucci offered a pointed warning. He remains a long-term Bitcoin bull, but likened the current wave of debt-backed $BTC buying to the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) boom of 2020-2021. The damage would come if the companies ever started to unwind. They might be forced to sell Bitcoin to cover any debts. He isn’t alone in this concern. Swiss bank Sygnum recently echoed similar warnings, noting the risk of cascading liquidations if the price of BTC falls while debt obligations come due. In essence, what looks like bullish conviction may also be quietly sowing seeds of future volatility. The Solana Alternative: On-Chain, Yield-Driven, and Native Canadian DeFi Development Corp takes a radically different approach. Instead of issuing bonds to buy tokens, it’s building a self-sustaining, yield-generating treasury inside the Solana ecosystem. The company launched in April, and already holds a 620K $SOL reserve worth $90M. Their goal is to grow $SOL per share, not just stack tokens. To that end, in May, they purchased a Solana validator set. With the Solana validator, all purchased $SOL could be instantly staked, generating more yield and steadily increasing the all-important $SOL-to-shares ratio. There was a 7-for-1 stock split for the underlying DeFi Development Corp stock ($DFDV) in May to boost liquidity, but so far, the company’s strategy has paid off: $DFDV stock is up a massive 4,408% so far this year. The company’s success may already be inspiring imitators. Another Canadian company, SOL Strategies, just filed with the SEC to list on the NASDAQ. Will the new Solana treasury approach lead to a new class of crypto treasuries that are organic, resilient, and native to the chains they support? And if they do, what could that do to Solana and the upcoming Solana Layer-2, Solaxy? Solaxy ($SOLX) – Last Chance to Buy 100x with First Solana Layer-2 With a new Solana treasury strategy making waves, Solaxy ($SOLX) could have perfect timing. Building treasuries for yield will require leveraging all that a blockchain has to offer. And with Solaxy, Solana now offers all of Ethereum’s infrastructure and scalability in addition to $SOL’s native low costs and speed. That could set Solaxy on course to explode as DeFi projects and meme coins flock to the new Layer 2. The Testnet is already live with the Block Explorer and Bridge. The full launch schedule runs into July and includes expanding the Solana-Ethereum bridge to Solaxy once it goes live. The schedule concludes on July 21, 2025, with the debut of the Solaxy Igniter, a pump.fun-style meme coin launchpad. The $SOLX token is available for $0.001766 for the next four days as part of the last chance to buy between the presale and token launch. Our own price prediction indicates the token could reach $0.025 by the end of the year, delivering 1300% returns to current investors. Don’t delay – this could be the lowest the token will ever go. Learn how to buy Solaxy with our guide. Solaxy + Solana: The Future of Crypto Treasuries? The rise of Bitcoin treasuries brought institutional credibility to crypto, but it may have also introduced dangerous financial engineering. As criticism rises over the debt-based model, a Solana-native alternative is emerging. And Solaxy ($SOLX) is poised to supercharge the Solana ecosystem, indirectly further boosting Solana treasuries.

Price forecasts suggest ETH could climb modestly to around $2,665 by mid-2025. That’s a 2% uptick, which is not bad, but far from thrilling. Meanwhile, another name is making waves for a completely different reason. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just about growth. It’s about empowerment. Through its radical mobile mining model, Bitcoin Solaris is offering something Ethereum never could: a way for anyone, anywhere, to build wealth directly from their phone. And it’s doing so with unmatched speed, transparency, and inclusivity, making BTC-S more than a token. It’s a movement. Ethereum’s Steady Climb… and Its Limits Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto world. It powers thousands of dApps, secures billions in DeFi, and is the standard for smart contracts. But it’s also facing serious friction. Transaction fees, complexity, and staking barriers continue to make ETH more of a developer platform than a retail wealth machine. A 2% forecasted price increase in 2025 isn’t inspiring the next generation of investors. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris is delivering a completely new model. One where you don’t need to buy in big, you just need to start mining from your device.

2025-06-19T10:34:11,"Nobitex's Source Code Released a Day After Hackers Steal Tokens Across Bitcoin, EVM, Ripple Networks","The pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande released the full source code of Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, just a day after orchestrating a $100 million exploit across multiple blockchains as the war between the two countries nears the end of its first week. The move raised fresh concerns for users who have not yet withdrawn their assets from the platform because the code makes it extremely easy for nefarious actors to access and exploit. Israel attacked military and nuclear sites in Iran on Friday saying it had to take action to prevent its enemy, which has vowed to wipe the Jewish state off the map, attaining nuclear weapons. Iran responded with ballistic missile launches targeting the entire country, sending millions into shelters at short notice. In an X post on Thursday, the hacker group, whose name is Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, wrote: “Time’s up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN.” The leak included blockchain scripts, internal privacy settings and a list of servers, effectively dismantling the exchange’s back-end security. The source code dump follows through on threats issued a day earlier, when Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for the hack and promised to release internal data. The group accused Nobitex of aiding Iran in circumventing international sanctions and called the platform the “regime’s favorite sanctions violation tool.” Over $90 million in tokens from Bitcoin, EVM, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana and other networks were deliberately sent to burner addresses, making recovery unlikely. Blockchain data shows that funds were moved to provocatively named wallets, such as “1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX” and “DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t,” suggesting the use of brute-force-generated vanity addresses that the attackers do not hold private keys for. The IRCG, or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , is an powerful and influential branch of the Iranian military. Nobitex responded on Thursday, stating that no additional losses occurred after the leak and that it plans to begin restoring services within five days, although ongoing internet disruptions in Iran may delay the recovery.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/19/nobitexs-source-code-released-a-day-after-hackers-steal-tokens-across-bitcoin-evm-ripple-networks,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Markets|Hacks|Iran|Israel|Crypto Exchanges|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T10:30:09,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Phenomenal 8-Day Streak Sees $388.73M Boost for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Phenomenal 8-Day Streak Sees $388.73M Boost for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Exciting times continue in the world of cryptocurrency investments! The market for US spot Bitcoin ETFs is buzzing, recently demonstrating a significant period of sustained positive activity that’s capturing the attention of investors everywhere. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows On June 18th, the landscape for US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable development: a combined net inflow of a substantial $388.73 million. This figure isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the eighth consecutive trading day where these investment vehicles have attracted more money than they’ve seen withdrawn. This consistent trend, highlighted by data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, signals growing confidence and interest from the market. What exactly are these inflows? Essentially, they represent the total value of new money flowing into the ETFs as investors buy shares, minus the value of shares being sold (outflows). Positive net inflows indicate that there’s more buying pressure than selling pressure within these specific investment products. Which ETFs Are Leading the Charge? While the overall picture is positive, the inflows weren’t evenly distributed among all the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Some funds saw significant investor interest, while others experienced minor outflows or remained neutral. Here’s a breakdown of the key players on June 18th: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund continues to be a powerhouse, leading the pack with an impressive $279.27 million in net inflows. IBIT has consistently attracted large amounts of capital since its launch. Fidelity’s FBTC: Another major player, FBTC, also saw strong performance, bringing in $104.38 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s offering has been a popular choice alongside IBIT. Bitwise’s BITB: Bitwise’s ETF contributed positively to the total, recording $11.32 million in net inflows. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: The recently launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) added $10.12 million. This new fund is seen as a lower-fee alternative to Grayscale’s flagship product. Here’s a quick look at the numbers for the top movers: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (June 18th) IBIT BlackRock $279.27 million FBTC Fidelity $104.38 million BITB Bitwise $11.32 million BTC Grayscale (Mini Trust) $10.12 million Addressing GBTC Outflows In contrast to the positive trend seen in most funds, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a net outflow of $16.36 million on the same day. GBTC, which converted from a trust to an ETF, has seen significant outflows since the spot ETFs were approved. This is often attributed to investors moving to newer ETFs with lower fees or cashing out positions that were previously locked up in the trust structure. Despite this outflow, the combined inflows into other funds significantly outweighed the GBTC withdrawals, resulting in the strong overall positive figure. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S. market reported no significant net changes in inflows or outflows for June 18th, indicating that the activity was primarily concentrated in the funds mentioned above. What Does This Consecutive Inflow Streak Signify? An eight-day streak of net inflows is noteworthy for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs market. It suggests that: Sustained Demand: There is consistent buying interest, potentially from both retail and institutional investors, looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and easily accessible investment products. Growing Confidence: The prolonged positive trend can build confidence among potential investors who may have been hesitant initially. Market Integration: It highlights the increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets through these ETF structures. While daily flows can fluctuate, a streak like this points towards a potentially bullish sentiment developing around Bitcoin accessible via these regulated investment vehicles. Looking Ahead: The Impact of Bitcoin ETF Inflows The continued positive momentum in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a key metric for market observers. It can influence market sentiment and potentially contribute to price stability or upward movement for Bitcoin itself, as the ETF issuers need to buy BTC to back the shares being purchased by investors. The performance of funds like IBIT and FBTC , consistently attracting large sums, underscores their role in this new investment landscape. For investors, these ETFs offer a convenient way to add Bitcoin exposure to a traditional brokerage account without the complexities of buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in Bitcoin ETFs still carries the inherent volatility risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the $388.73 million net inflow on June 18th, extending an impressive eight-day streak, underscores the growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure via the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Led by strong performances from IBIT and FBTC , these inflows signal a potentially significant phase of institutional and retail adoption, despite continued outflows from GBTC .

2025-06-19T10:20:22,"Iran’s Nobitex Exchange Faces Renewed Threat After Hackers Leak Core Code","The fallout from the $100 million Nobitex exchange hack continues to deepen as hackers release the platform’s full source code, exposing users to further risk amid an already fragile security situation. Key Takeaways: Hackers leaked Nobitex’s full source code, putting remaining user assets at risk. The $100M breach was politically motivated, with attackers burning most of the stolen funds. Iran imposed new crypto exchange curfews as Nobitex works to restore services amid internet disruptions. The Iranian crypto exchange, which suffered a major breach on Wednesday, is now facing renewed threats after the pro-Israel hacker group “Gonjeshke Darande” followed through on its warning to leak internal data. On Thursday, the group posted a link on X containing Nobitex’s source code, privacy configurations, cold wallet scripts, and server lists. “Time’s up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN,” the group declared in its post, suggesting that any assets still on the platform are vulnerable. Hackers Share Nobitex Code in Politically Motivated Hack Gonjeshke Darande claims it targeted Nobitex due to its alleged ties to the Iranian government and its role in circumventing international sanctions. In a follow-up post on Wednesday, the group said it had burned $90 million across eight wallets, effectively removing the stolen funds from circulation. 12 hours ago 8 burn addresses burned $90M from the wallets of the regime's favorite sanctions violation tool, Nobitex. 12 hours from now The source-code of Nobitex will be open to the public, and Nobitex’s walled garden will be without walls. Where do you want your assets to be?… — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 18, 2025 The breach took place amid heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel. The hack occurred on the fifth day of open conflict, which included strategic missile strikes exchanged by both countries. It also marks the largest cyber-related damage to Iran’s crypto sector since the beginning of its digital finance expansion. Nobitex, for its part, stated on Thursday that no further losses had occurred and that it was working to restore services within five days. The company cited internet instability inside Iran as a key challenge to its recovery timeline. CEO Amir Rad is expected to issue a video address to update users on the next steps. In response to the hack, Iran’s central bank has introduced a curfew on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges , restricting operational hours to 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., according to data referenced by Chainalysis. Crypto Market Bleeds $200B Amid Iran-Israel Conflict The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran triggered a sharp dip in crypto market confidence, with sentiment dropping over 30% between June 12–15, according to Santiment. This coincided with a 4–6% drop in Bitcoin’s price, erasing more than $200 billion in total crypto market value. The ongoing conflict between Israel & Iran has led to a visible increase in volatility across crypto. Sentiment data showed major bearish sentiment coming in between June 12th to 15th, in particular, coinciding with a 4–6% drop in Bitcoin's price and erasing over $200B from… pic.twitter.com/t1Qe7DlOCf — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 18, 2025 Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has since stabilized around the $104K–$105K range. Analysts attribute this resilience to steady ETF inflows and the lack of further military escalation. A similar pattern was observed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where Bitcoin dipped briefly before recovering. Geopolitical crises continue to influence crypto volatility, with Bitcoin often following a “drop then stabilize” cycle. As tensions persist in the Middle East, markets may see further short-term price swings, though the long-term trajectory remains uncertain.

Following the FOMC meeting, broader sentiment in equity markets is mildly negative, with Nasdaq futures down 0.32%. While this isn’t an outright bearish signal, it does keep traders cautious—yet open to directional setups as the session unfolds.</p><p>tradeCompass Summary – June 19, 2025</p><p>Bullish above: $2,557
Bearish below: $2,504.75
Current price: $2,525
Market sentiment: Slightly bearish but undecided</p><p>ETH remains caught between thresholds, so price action near either edge will define the day's bias. Once confirmed, the tradeCompass methodology provides a clear roadmap for execution and partial profit-taking.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bullish Profit Targets</p><p>If Ethereum futures cross and hold above $2,557, the following targets apply:</p><p>$2,567
Quick initial target at the 3rd upper standard deviation of yesterday’s VWAP. Good for immediate risk reduction.</p><p>$2,589
A high-volume node where previous reactions occurred. Expect potential stall or partial unwind.</p><p>$2,604.5
Just below the value area high (VAH) from two days ago. This is a meaningful structural level in Ethereum technical analysis.</p><p>$2,625
Near the VWAP from June 16, often acting as a magnet or inflection point.</p><p>$2,664
Just under the June 16 VAH, where larger players may rotate out or fade moves.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,850
A longer-term swing target if bullish momentum accelerates. This level aligns with broader trend continuation potential.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bearish Profit Targets</p><p>If price breaks below $2,504.75 and confirms momentum:</p><p>$2,499
First quick drop zone, likely to capture trapped longs.</p><p>$2,488.5
Aligned with yesterday’s value area low, this is a standard partial-profit point.</p><p>$2,474.5
Matches prior lows and the second lower deviation of yesterday’s VWAP—expect bounces or reversals here.</p><p>$2,456.7
Just above the third lower VWAP deviation, a high-risk but high-reward target for aggressive shorts.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,315
Backed by volume profile clusters from May 9. A valid swing target if broader risk sentiment deteriorates.</p><p>Extreme Runner: $2,160
This level, ~14.3% below the current price, would require significant breakdown and would only be reached in an extended bearish cycle.</p><p>Understanding tradeCompass: A Professional Technical Framework</p><p>The tradeCompass method integrates:</p><ul><li><p>Volume Profile (VAH, VAL, POC): Highlights areas of price acceptance and rejection</p></li><li><p>VWAP and Standard Deviations: Frames intraday fair value and volatility-based bands</p></li><li><p>Liquidity Zones & Round Numbers: Identifies where market makers and algorithms operate</p></li><li><p>Partial Profit-Taking Strategy: Reduces risk exposure while maximizing opportunity</p></li></ul><p>By defining clear bullish/bearish thresholds and structured exit levels, it reduces overtrading and guides disciplined execution.</p><p>Ethereum Technical Outlook – Use tradeCompass as a Map</p><p>The $2,557 and $2,504.75 levels act as directional decision points. Wait for price confirmation around these lines to engage. Remember, this isn't just a prediction—it's a map for navigating uncertainty. If price fails to break out, patience is a better trade.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>This Ethereum technical analysis offers a decision-support framework, not financial advice.
