2025-06-19T15:54:09,"Tomorrow is a Critical Day at Deribit, the Crypto Options Exchange! Billions of Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Options Contracts Are Coming to an End! Here Are the De...","Tomorrow, a major expiration event will occur in the crypto derivatives market. Approximately $3.9 billion worth of options contracts will reach expiration on Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange. $3.9 Billion in Crypto Options to Expire on Deribit as Investors Turn Bullish on Ethereum This event is expected to cause significant volatility in both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets. Of the total, $3.3 billion is made up of the notional value of Bitcoin options. The Put/Call ratio is at 1.16, indicating a slight downtrend as traders hold more put options than calls. However, the maximum pain point is set at $106,000, which is the price at which the option will become worthless, suggesting a relatively neutral positioning. Market data suggests that BTC options are clustered around this level, suggesting a balanced outlook from investors ahead of expiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum options total $546 million and the Put/Call ratio is just 0.68, a clear sign of bullish sentiment among traders. The maximum pain price for ETH is $2,600, but option activity is weighted towards call positions, indicating strong expectations for an upward price movement. The concept of maximum pain, where the most options expire worthless, is often cited as a short-term price magnet during expiration events. As such, current levels of $106,000 for BTC and $2,600 for ETH could act as centers of attraction in the hours leading up to expiration. While Bitcoin's market positioning appears cautious, Ethereum's bullish momentum could lead to increased volatility and potential upside moves, especially if the overall market sentiment remains positive. Traders and analysts will be watching closely to see if these expectations come true or if surprise moves disrupt the charts in the final hours before contracts close. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T15:30:49,"Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point","Ethereum is trading within a tight range that has held for several weeks, forming the kind of compression structure that often leads to a significant breakout. Despite heightened volatility in global markets driven by escalating tensions in the Middle East, ETH has remained resilient, holding strong above key demand zones around the $2,500–$2,600 area. The current environment is marked by uncertainty, with geopolitical conflict and macroeconomic risks weighing on investor sentiment. Yet Ethereum’s price structure suggests that bulls are patiently building momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook, pointing out that Ethereum is mirroring the same consolidation pattern that Bitcoin followed during its 2017–2021 cycle. In that historical setup, BTC compressed into a tight range before entering a parabolic rally once the upper boundary was broken. If Ethereum follows a similar path, the next move could be dramatic, especially if it clears major resistance levels like $2,800. As long as ETH holds range support and absorbs both upside and downside wicks, this setup remains intact. A breakout above the current range could ignite a fresh leg up for Ethereum—and possibly spark renewed strength across the altcoin market. Ethereum Builds Momentum As Market Awaits Clarity Ethereum is currently trading in a tight range, consolidating just above the $2,600 level and holding firm despite macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. After rallying nearly 80% from its April lows, ETH appears to be preparing for a decisive move in the coming sessions. However, with escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and uncertainty surrounding possible U.S. involvement, broader markets remain cautious. Until clarity emerges on the geopolitical front, sideways price action may persist. Still, Ethereum’s price structure remains constructive. Strong consolidation above key demand zones reflects ongoing buyer interest and a lack of heavy selling pressure. This behavior often precedes major moves, as investors accumulate ahead of expected volatility. Some market participants remain cautious, warning of a possible retrace below the $2,400 level if demand falters or broader risk sentiment weakens. In contrast, bullish analysts like Ted Pillows suggest a more optimistic outlook. According to Pillows, Ethereum is closely following the path Bitcoin took during its 2017–2021 cycle, where tight consolidation ultimately led to a breakout and parabolic rally. In this view, ETH’s real explosive phase won’t begin until it breaks above $4,000. If this scenario plays out, Ethereum could trigger a broader altcoin surge and shift overall crypto market sentiment bullish once again. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% ETH Technical Analysis: Consolidation Near Key Levels The 3-day Ethereum chart shows a prolonged consolidation phase as ETH trades near the $2,500 mark. Despite geopolitical uncertainty and rising macroeconomic risks, Ethereum has held above the $2,400 support zone, forming a tight range just below the critical resistance at $2,775. This area also coincides with the 200-day SMA (red line), which continues to cap upward momentum. ETH remains above the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) SMAs, suggesting bullish momentum is intact, though lacking follow-through. The recent candle bodies show decreasing volatility, with wicks on both sides being absorbed—a classic sign of compression that often precedes a large move. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching – Will History Repeat? Volume has declined slightly compared to the breakout in early May, indicating a temporary pause in bullish conviction. However, if Ethereum manages a higher close above the $2,775 resistance, it could trigger an impulsive breakout targeting the $3,000 level. On the downside, a break below $2,400 would invalidate the current structure and expose ETH to a deeper correction toward $2,100.

2025-06-19T15:21:57,"Only 30% of Russian crypto miners registered, says finance ministry","Most of the crypto miners in Russia don’t comply with the regulations the country imposed on mining. Russia is taking steps to legalize and regulate crypto mining to bring it out of the informal economy. Still, most crypto miners in the country fall outside relevant regulation, authorities say. On Tuesday, June 19, the Finance Ministry revealed that just 30% of miners are registered with the relevant tax authorities. According to Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov, registering crypto mining entities is still an ongoing process. The authorities aim to bring miners into the regulated economy, where they can be taxed and managed. “Our general approach, when we introduced regulation of mining in this industry, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible. We have not yet completed this process. So far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the Federal Tax Service, and this process is still far from complete. Another 2/3 need to be “cleaned up” and entered into the register. Therefore, we will work to complete this process,” Chebeskov said. Still, taxation is not the only reason for registration. Starting in 2025, Russia has banned crypto mining in certain regions with weaker infrastructure, especially during peak hours. The goal is to reduce the strain on electrical grids. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 Russia moves to formalize crypto mining Russia legalized crypto mining in 2023 as part of its ongoing effort to tax and regulate the industry. In 2024, the country imposed a 15% tax on cryptocurrency mining profits, based on market value when received. However, it also lifted some taxes, including VAT on crypto purchases. For Russian citizens and businesses, Bitcoin (BTC) mining remains a profitable way to leverage the country’s cheap energy prices. At the same time, low living standards and ongoing sanctions make it a competitive way for both individuals and companies to earn income.

2025-06-19T15:16:09,"Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Continues! Here is the Latest Data","Institutional interest in U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues. Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong investor interest, recording net inflows of $2.4 billion for the eighth day in a row. Wednesday alone saw inflows of $389.5 million. $2.4 Billion Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 8 Days: Signals of a Slowdown in Ethereum ETFs BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead BlackRock’s IBIT fund led the way with net inflows of $278.9 million on Wednesday alone, while Fidelity’s FBTC fund raised $104.4 million on the same day. Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s BTC Mini, and Hashdex’s DEFI funds saw inflows of $11.3 million, $10.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s high-fee GBTC fund stood out with a single net outflow of $16.4 million. In the 8-day period, 96% of total inflows were made to the IBIT fund, which attracted $2.3 billion in investments during this time. The ETF Store President Nate Geraci emphasized institutional interest by saying, “There has been $11.5 billion inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs so far in 2025. This is the second year. Still no demand?” in a statement on social media platform X. There have been a total of $46.9 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their January 2024 debut, and these funds currently manage approximately $125 billion in assets. On the Ethereum side, there is a calmer picture. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $19.1 million on Wednesday. $15.1 million of this inflow was made to BlackRock’s ETHA fund. The slowdown in flows is notable after the 19-day record inflow streak of $1.4 billion for Ethereum ETFs that ended last week. Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of more than $3.8 billion in the same 19-day period. Total net inflows for Ethereum ETFs currently sit at $3.9 billion. BRN Research Analyst Valentin Fournier commented on the slowdown in institutional interest in Ethereum: “Data suggests institutions maintain a bullish medium-term perspective on crypto, but the catch-up phase in Ethereum appears to be over.” Macro Uncertainties Pressure Market Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,810, down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and 2.5% in the last week, while Ethereum is down 8.3% to $2,527 in the same period. The FOMC was expected to keep interest rates unchanged, but the statement took a more hawkish tone. “Bitcoin is holding above $100,000 but has failed to break resistance levels. A retest of $102,000 support looks likely,” Fournier said. The Long-Term Investment Story is Getting Stronger 21Shares Crypto Investments Expert David Hernandez drew a more optimistic picture: “As confidence in soft landings wanes and global financial imbalances rise, Bitcoin’s scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality make it an increasingly attractive asset for investors grappling with uncertainty.” “Bitcoin has established a permanent foothold above the $100,000 level. Its resilience to geopolitical shocks further solidifies its place in the investment world.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T15:05:18,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Nears Inflection Point, What’s Next?","XRP continues to trade within a tight consolidation range while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate recent market headlines. Despite lacking strong bullish momentum, XRP’s price action shows resilience, holding key support zones across both USDT and BTC pairs. However, both charts suggest that the asset is nearing critical inflection points, where a breakdown or breakout could define the next major move. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRP/USDT remains compressed within a long-term descending channel pattern, bounded by a descending trendline from the yearly highs and a horizontal support near $1.95, with tons of sell-side liquidity resting under it. The pair is currently trading around $2.15, just under both the 100 and 200 moving averages. The RSI is also hovering near 44, indicating the lack of momentum and confirming the range-bound behavior. The asset is currently coiling just above the highlighted liquidity level, suggesting that if sellers manage to breach $1.95, the next logical demand zone lies around $1.6. Meanwhile, upside resistance remains at the upper bound of the channel near $2.60, which has rejected multiple attempts in recent weeks. A clean break and daily close above that trendline would potentially confirm a bullish rally, with the target being around $3. Until then, this is still a neutral structure favoring range traders rather than trend-followers. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP has shown persistent weakness since March, consistently printing lower highs and lower lows. The chart highlights a large descending wedge formation, with price now moving toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Both the 100 and 200 moving averages are angled downward after a bearish crossover, and the RSI is still depressed near 42, reflecting ongoing relative underperformance. That said, the pair is approaching the imbalance zone (FVG) left from the explosive rally in late 2024. This pocket, located just below 1900 SAT, could act as a magnet for price while also offering potential for a relief bounce. If the buyers step in, the first challenge lies near the higher trendline of the wedge around 2200 SAT, which coincides with a horizontal resistance level. A decisive move above that level could shift short-term momentum, but unless that happens, the pair remains locked in a clear bearish structure.

While some major altcoins show mixed performance, the overall pattern points to a potential major rally ahead. After a massive, four-year consolidation period, the altcoin market may be entering a “final shakeout” phase before a significant and sustained breakout, according to a growing number of technical analysts.

2025-06-19T15:00:00,"Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Tax Preparation","In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Bryan Courchesne from DAIM provides information on tax planning for crypto trades. Although we are half a year away from tax season, there are many considerations to track in order to be tax-ready. Then, Saim Akif from Akif CPA breaks down the differences in tax treatment between crypto and equities/bonds in Ask an Expert. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Taxes Are Complicated, Don’t Let Them Derail Your Portfolio As advisors focused on crypto, we’re familiar with the unique tax situations this asset class presents. For example, crypto is not subject to wash-sale rules, which allows for more efficient tax-loss harvesting. It also enables direct asset swaps, such as converting bitcoin (BTC) to ether (ETH) or ETH to Solana (SOL), without first selling into cash. These are just a couple of features that set crypto apart from traditional investments. However, perhaps the most important thing for investors to consider is the sheer number of platforms they may use and how challenging it can be to track everything at tax time. Tracking your crypto taxes isn’t just a year-end chore; it’s a year-round challenge, especially if you’re active on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Every trade, swap, airdrop, staking reward, or bridging event can be a taxable event. Centralized Exchange Trading When using CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you may receive year-end tax summaries, but those are often incomplete or inconsistent across platforms. One major challenge is tracking your cost basis across exchanges. For example, if you buy Amazon stock in a Fidelity account and transfer it to Schwab, your cost basis transfers seamlessly and updates with each new trade. At tax time, Schwab can generate an accurate 1099 showing your gains and losses. But in crypto, if you transfer assets from Kraken to Coinbase, your cost basis doesn’t automatically transfer with them. If you’re moving assets across multiple platforms, you’ll need to manually track every transaction, or you’ll face a major headache when filing taxes. Decentralized Exchange Trading Things get even more complicated when using DEXs. Apps like Coinbase Wallet (not to be confused with the Coinbase exchange) or Phantom connect you to decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter. These DEXs don’t issue tax forms or track your cost basis, so it’s entirely up to you to log and reconcile every transaction. Miss a single token swap or forget to record the fair market value of a liquidity pool withdrawal, and your tax report could be inaccurate. That could trigger IRS scrutiny or lead to missed deductions. While some apps can calculate gains and losses from a single wallet address, they often struggle when assets are transferred between addresses, making them less useful for active users. And here’s the kicker: if you’re actively trading on DEXs, chances are you’re not even making money. But even losses must be reported correctly to qualify for a deduction. If not, you risk losing the write-off or, worse, facing an audit. Unless you’re a full-time crypto trader, the time and effort required to track every transaction isn’t just stressful, it can cost you real money. What steps can I take to make sure I'm tax ready? There are, however, several ways to prepare properly for crypto taxes: Use crypto tax software from the beginning. Even then, you’ll want to double-check that the reported activity makes sense and adjust as needed. Hire a crypto tax specialist or work with a crypto-focused advisor who understands the landscape. Download all transaction logs and see if your CPA or advisor can help build a cost basis and determine your realized gains and losses. As adoption increases, tax reporting will undoubtedly evolve — in the meantime keeping track of your trade activity is important to be ready for tax season. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. Why are advisors watching crypto closely? A. Institutional crypto inflows have surged to $35 billion . While crypto is more volatile than traditional assets, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have historically outperformed other traditional asset classes since 2012. Q. How is crypto being treated differently from equities/bonds from a tax side? A. Crypto differs fundamentally from equities and bonds. Advisors must track each wallet separately for cost basis (starting Jan 2025). Unlike traditional 1099s, clients often get little to no reporting support from exchanges, especially for self-custodied assets. Q. Do you have any special insights for CPAs and tax advisors? A. Compliance isn’t optional anymore. Starting with 2025 returns: Wallet-level cost basis reporting is mandatory. IRS Form 1099-DA will begin showing up in 2026. Exchanges often don’t support reporting for self-custodied assets.

2025-06-19T14:55:26,"Elon Musk’s X targets stock and crypto trading features in major expansion","Elon Musk’s app X (formerly Twitter) will soon let people trade crypto and stocks straight from their accounts, without ever leaving the platform. That’s the latest update from Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, who said the company is building out full financial tools for users to control everything from payments to investing. The comments came during an interview with the Financial Times at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, where she explained how this new plan fits into Elon’s larger plan to turn X into an “everything app.” “You’ll be able to come to X and be able to transact your whole financial life on the platform,” Linda said, speaking directly about the new investment features. “And that’s whether I can pay you for the pizza that we shared last night or make an investment or a trade. So that’s the future.” This expansion will allow people to pay for goods, tip creators, and make trades on the same platform they already use for content. X plans US rollout of X Money and financial tools X is rolling out its financial services in stages. First up is X Money, a new digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment system that will launch in the United States before expanding to other countries. Linda said X Money will support functions like tipping, saving, and buying things directly in the app. X is also partnering with Visa to back the payment system and plans to add an X-branded credit or debit card as early as this year. Elon bought the company, then called Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. Since then, he’s tried to turn it into a catch-all platform modeled after WeChat, the Chinese app that blends messaging, social media, shopping, and finance. Linda said this new expansion isn’t just about payments. She said: “A whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem is going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today.” But adding financial tools means X has to face regulatory challenges. Services like stock trading, crypto transfers, and payments come with licensing issues, money laundering laws, and compliance requirements that are far stricter than anything the company has dealt with before. That hasn’t stopped Elon from pushing forward. At the same time, X is still trying to fix its ad revenue problem. After Elon’s takeover, most of the platform’s advertisers pulled out, saying they didn’t want their brands next to toxic content or political chaos. Revenue dropped from $4.1 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion last year, but research firm Emarketer projects it might climb to $2.3 billion in 2025. X battles with advertisers while pushing AI tie-in X has also been accused of pressuring brands to come back. The Wall Street Journal reported that companies like Verizon and Ralph Lauren agreed to buy ads after allegedly being threatened with legal action. Linda denied that and said, “It’s unnamed sources, random third-party commenters.” She called the claims “hearsay” and said X never forced anyone to spend money. To make matters worse, some advertisers at Cannes said they’re still not confident in the platform. One person claimed they were told they had to hit a spending threshold or face a lawsuit. Another said Elon’s close ties with President Donald Trump made them uneasy about saying no to ad deals. X is already suing the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, a group of brands and ad agencies, for organizing what it says was an illegal boycott under the pretense of “online safety.” That lawsuit, filed last summer, accuses them of breaking competition laws. Since then, the company has removed and added brands from the complaint. It dropped Unilever after the company started buying ads again in October. Still, Linda told advertisers that 96% of pre-acquisition clients are now back. She claimed X is close to recovering its full ad business from 2022. But the people on the ground aren’t fully convinced. Some said they still think the platform is too unpredictable. Others think the content’s still too toxic.

The self-described gold bug argued that poor people focus on the price while the rich focus on the quantity of the asset they continue to hold. Although he noted that prices are important, Kiyosaki stressed investors need to prioritize the quantity of Bitcoin, gold, or silver that they own. “While price is important….the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin…The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices,” he said. Kiyosaki further revealed that he acquired his first Bitcoin when the crypto was valued at $6,000 and has not looked back since then. While he did not divulge more information on the amount he currently holds, the famed author wished he had more “fake money” to buy more of the premier crypto. Kiyosaki has long contended that safe haven assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin are essential hedges against inflation and important for long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. Analysts Eye $1 Million BTC By 2030 Kiyosaki is not the only industry figure foreseeing a seven-figure Bitcoin price tag by 2030. In May 2024, Twitter (now X) co-founder Jack Dorsey said a single BTC would be worth $1 million by 2030 and could appreciate more. While delivering a speech in December at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million owing to its scarcity.

2025-06-19T14:45:36,"Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why","The post Crypto Tax in Australia May End : Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Australia is known for its crypto-friendly environment , but recent legal developments may completely change how Bitcoin is taxed in the country. Bitcoin Reclassification: Major Legal Update In May 2025 , a significant ruling by Victorian Magistrate Michael O’Connell in a Bitcoin theft case suggested that Bitcoin could be recognized as Australian currency , not property. This landmark statement has sparked intense debate across the crypto community and tax authorities. Adrian Carter, a co-defendant in the case, said: “It was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences.” If Bitcoin is officially reclassified as currency, this could eliminate capital gains tax (CGT) on BTC transactions and result in the government owing nearly AUS$1 billion (approx. US$640 million) in past tax collections. Is Bitcoin Really Tax-Free Now? Not yet. The ruling is under appeal and has not been officially regulated . While the decision received attention, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has not updated its guidance . Until higher courts confirm Bitcoin as legal tender, the existing tax framework remains in place. Current Crypto Tax Regime in Australia (2025) Cryptos including BTC, ETH, NFTs, stablecoins, and DeFi are classified as CGT assets . Subject to Capital Gains Tax between 0% and 40% , based on individual income brackets. A 50% CGT discount applies if assets are held for over 12 months before being sold. The ATO tracks all crypto activity, and non-compliance can lead to legal penalties . Any Tax Loopholes for Crypto Investors? Despite rumors, there are no loopholes in the current regime. Even if investors hope for CGT exemptions, the law remains unchanged until Bitcoin is officially recognized as currency by a higher court and accepted by the ATO. Final Thoughts Unless Bitcoin is formally reclassified, Australian investors and businesses must follow the existing crypto tax rules . The ATO continues to treat digital assets as property, not money, and capital gains tax still applies to all crypto-related transactions.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-in-australia-may-end-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

The more the Bitcoin price traverses sideways, the further upwards the price is likely to climb once a breakout takes place. $BTC ranging for a month Source: TradingView The $BTC price has been ranging sideways for a good month now. Since breaking back above $102,000, the price has been up to make the all-time high, has meandered back down to make a low at $100,400, and is currently moving inside a wedge pattern that could break one way or the other. In favour of the bulls, the Stochastic RSIs for the short to medium term time frames have their indicators at the bottom. As can be seen in the chart above, the 4-hour indicators are just making their way up, so perhaps price may start rising. $BTC bouncing from 0.618 Fibonacci Source: TradingView Moving into the daily time frame it can be seen that a series of lower highs is starting to converge with a series of higher lows. It can also be noted that the 0.618 Fibonacci level is playing an important role. Since the big dip down to just above $100,000, the price has been respecting the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $104,300. If the price can now bounce from here, a breakout of the top trendline could be the result. In addition, if the price breaks down, things wouldn’t necessarily be that bad for the bulls, as more sideways price action could take place. Weekly chart shows potential bounce from good support structure Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the potential lift-off point for Bitcoin. The support lines are drawn across from the last time weekly candle bodies made their tops at $102,000 and $104,000. If the price can stay above the $104,400 level at this coming weekly close, there is a good chance of a bounce, and at the very least more sideways price action that would act to build more price structure above this level and make it very strong support.

2025-06-19T14:44:02,"Ohio’s House of Representatives Passes Crypto Bill to Allow $200 Tax Free Threshold for Crypto Transactions","Ohio’s House of Representatives has passed a bill that incentivises crypto use, such as mining and staking activities, and exempts crypto transactions from capital gains tax. If passed by the Senate, the new laws would exempt crypto transactions that fall below a $200 threshold from requiring capital gains tax. The threshold exemption would encourage using Bitcoin as a form of money. If passed by the Senate, the new laws in Ohio may provide some headway in allowing consumers to use cryptocurrencies as currencies for everyday purchases. The new legislation, House Bill 116, passed with a vote of 70-26. Lawmakers titled the bill the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. House Bill 116 now has to pass the Senate and then, if passed, has to be signed off by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. The bill has been promoted mainly by Republican Representative Steve Demetriou, who argues that it will make it easier for consumers to use crypto and protect the crypto mining industry from excessive government overreach. Steve Demetriou, House Representative, sponsored the bill in February, allowing the bill to pass the House Technology and Innovation Committee with a vote of 13-0. The bill has now passed the House of Representatives and has a chance to be signed into law. The bill was passed just a day after the Genius Act passed the Senate at the federal level. The Genius Act provides provisions for the stablecoin market to dispel uncertainty for token issuers and provide consumer protections. Demetriou said the new bill allowed Ohio to show the world that it is ready to embrace the new economy and use digital assets. Demetriou further stated that the legislation will enable the growth of blockchain innovations in Ohio. The Republican Representative said he aimed to sponsor common-sense legislation for a technologically advanced innovation. Ohio plans to attract crypto entrepreneurs to the state, enticing them with incentives to bring their assets and capital with them, enriching the state with a wealth of resources that other states have rejected. Time will tell whether such an incentive-based approach to regulation and tax will benefit the local economy. Other states may follow suit if the regulatory incentives prove to be successful. House Bill 116 is quite a unique piece of legislation because it proposes a $200 threshold for tax-free use of cryptocurrencies. The bill is a simple but targeted approach to legislation. This is most likely what Demetriou meant when he said he wanted to sponsor a common-sense bill. The tax incentives aim to lower the burden on consumers so they can feel free to spend their crypto without worrying about reporting every transaction. Crypto mining operations were also featured in the bill. Crypto miners will be allowed to operate mining rigs in residential areas if they adhere to noise restrictions and respect their neighbours. Industrial areas will also be allowed to host mining operations. The bill made specific provisions that protect crypto miners from land rezoning. The bill will ban rezoning projects that affect crypto mining businesses. Crypto miners will be subject to laws that affect similar companies in the state. Miners will be able to dispute any grievances that they face. The bill aims to treat crypto mining like a regular business without creating unnecessary laws for the crypto industry. House Bill 116 comes as other crypto bills are introduced in Ohio. Both the state and federal levels of the American government are debating rules that apply to the crypto industry. Ohio has also proposed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill allowing the state to invest public funds into Bitcoin. New Hampshire and Arizona have already set a precedent in passing Bitcoin Treasury laws. At the federal level, an ongoing effort is still to pass President Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law. The new rules would allow the US government to redirect seized Bitcoin from criminal proceedings to create a fund for future use. The states of Texas, Florida, and Montana are still seeking laws for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve of their own. Other states may reassess the viability of a reserve treasury if other states successfully implement their own strategies. As a federal politician, Tim Burchett has been essential to implementing President Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve into law. An alignment of state and federal legislation would give blockchain companies a large boost to focus on their businesses and worry less about legislation. Consumers will also benefit from such an alignment because they will have more options to spend and save their cryptocurrencies without feeling the burden of draconian tax requirements.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ohios-house-of-representatives-passes-crypto-bill-to-allow-200-tax-free-threshold-for-crypto-transactions/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T14:40:09,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Makes Bold Move, Boosting Holdings In the ever-evolving landscape of corporate finance and investment, a notable trend continues to gain momentum: the strategic acquisition of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. This isn’t just about speculative trading; for many companies, it’s becoming a core component of their long-term treasury and growth strategies. The latest example comes from London-listed technology firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC) , which recently announced a significant boost to its Bitcoin reserves. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? SWC’s move isn’t happening in a vacuum. A growing number of publicly traded and private companies are allocating portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. But why? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its capped supply compared to fiat currencies. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, similar to gold, but with greater portability and divisibility. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify corporate treasuries away from traditional assets like cash and bonds. Alignment with Future Trends: Investing in Bitcoin signals a forward-thinking approach and alignment with the burgeoning digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential. This strategic shift reflects a growing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. The Smarter Web Company ‘s Latest Move: A Closer Look The Smarter Web Company took to the social media platform X to share news of its recent Bitcoin acquisition. The company added an additional 104.28 BTC to its holdings. This isn’t a one-off purchase but part of a clearly defined, multi-year initiative known as “The 10 Year Plan.” This plan underscores SWC’s commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy over the long term. The acquisition of 104.28 BTC represents a substantial addition to their existing reserves. This specific amount was likely chosen based on market conditions, available capital, and the parameters set within their strategic plan. Growing Their Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this latest purchase, The Smarter Web Company ‘s total corporate Bitcoin holdings have increased significantly. The company now holds a cumulative total of 346.63 BTC. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the change: Holding Metric Previous Total Acquisition Amount New Total Total BTC Held Approx. 242.35 BTC 104.28 BTC 346.63 BTC This increase of over 40% in their Bitcoin reserves highlights the company’s increasing conviction in the role of digital assets within its financial framework. While 346.63 BTC might seem modest compared to some of the largest corporate holders like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it represents a significant commitment for a London-listed technology firm and positions them among a growing list of public companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. Understanding SWC’s Digital Asset Strategy : The 10 Year Plan The mention of “The 10 Year Plan” is crucial. This indicates that SWC’s foray into Bitcoin is not a short-term speculative play but a foundational element of their long-term financial and strategic vision. A digital asset strategy of this duration suggests several potential objectives: Long-Term Value Accumulation: Believing in Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly over a decade. Balance Sheet Resilience: Using Bitcoin to strengthen the balance sheet against economic uncertainties. Pioneering in the Tech Sector: Positioning SWC as an innovator and early adopter within the technology industry regarding digital finance. Potential Future Use Cases: Exploring how digital assets might integrate into their business operations or service offerings over time. Such a long-term outlook suggests a careful analysis of Bitcoin’s fundamentals, market cycles, and its potential role in the global economy. It moves beyond simple treasury management into a more strategic alignment with the future of finance and technology. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for SWC and the Market? SWC’s decision to increase its corporate Bitcoin holdings sends several signals: Confidence in Bitcoin: It demonstrates continued confidence in Bitcoin’s viability and potential despite market volatility. Execution of Strategy: It shows the company is actively executing its stated “The 10 Year Plan” regarding digital assets. Potential Influence: While not a market-moving amount on its own, it contributes to the broader trend of institutional adoption, which collectively impacts market sentiment and liquidity. Shareholder Signal: It signals to investors that SWC views digital assets as a valuable component of its future growth and stability. For the broader market, every public company announcing a Bitcoin purchase adds another data point to the narrative of institutional acceptance. This cumulative effect can bolster confidence among other potential corporate investors and retail participants alike. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are clear to companies like SWC, holding Bitcoin isn’t without its challenges. These include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the reported value of corporate holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Protecting large sums of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols and expertise. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may still be skeptical about digital assets. Companies pursuing a digital asset strategy must carefully navigate these challenges, implementing strong risk management frameworks and transparent communication with stakeholders. Examples of Other Companies with Significant Corporate Bitcoin Holdings SWC joins a growing list. The most prominent examples include: MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, viewing it as their primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla: Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Marathon Digital Holdings & Riot Platforms: These Bitcoin mining companies hold substantial amounts of BTC mined from their operations. Coinbase: As a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s natural for them to hold Bitcoin as part of their operations and investments. These examples, spanning different sectors, illustrate the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. SWC’s move reinforces this trend within the technology sector. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Watchers What can we learn from SWC’s recent Bitcoin acquisition ? Track Corporate Adoption: Pay attention to announcements from public companies regarding digital asset holdings. This trend is a significant indicator of market maturity. Understand the Strategy: Look beyond the headline number. Is it part of a stated long-term strategy like SWC’s “The 10 Year Plan”? This suggests a more fundamental belief in the asset. Assess Company Fundamentals: Evaluate the company’s core business alongside its digital asset strategy. The Bitcoin holdings are part of the larger financial picture. Consider the Sector: Technology companies are often at the forefront of adopting new financial technologies. SWC’s move aligns with this pattern. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset adoption is dynamic. Follow news and analysis from reputable sources. SWC’s action provides valuable insight into how companies are increasingly viewing and utilizing digital assets as part of their strategic financial planning. Conclusion: SWC Doubles Down on its Digital Asset Strategy The Smarter Web Company’s acquisition of an additional 104.28 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of their long-term commitment to digital assets as outlined in “The 10 Year Plan.” By increasing their corporate Bitcoin holdings to 346.63 BTC, SWC joins a growing cohort of companies that see strategic value in having Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This Bitcoin acquisition highlights the ongoing trend of institutional adoption and signals a forward-looking approach to finance and technology within The Smarter Web Company .

2025-06-19T14:35:52,"Bitcoin ETFs Log $388M in Daily Inflows Despite Geopolitical Tensions","U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $388.3 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking eight consecutive days of investor confidence despite market jitters stemming from renewed tensions between Israel and Iran . The surge in capital underscores the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as it continues to stabilize in the face of global uncertainty. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the charge, attracting $278.9 million and $104.4 million, respectively, according to data from Farside Investors. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) also contributed $11.3 million in inflows, while other prominent funds, including those by ARK Invest, Invesco, and VanEck, recorded no new capital on the day. Crypto analytics platform Santiment noted that Bitcoin’s resilience amid geopolitical uncertainty mirrors its behavior during past global conflicts. The current pattern is similar to Bitcoin’s price action following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2023, both of which triggered short-term sell-offs before price stabilization. Grayscale Lags Behind as Rivals Attract Capital While most of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed growing investor interest, Grayscale’s products continued to see capital outflows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) lost $16.4 million, and its recently introduced low-fee product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, saw $10.1 million in outflows. Despite early-year sluggishness, total inflows across all 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have surged to $11.2 billion since April 17. Altogether, the funds have attracted over $46.3 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity leading at $50.6 billion and $11.5 billion in total assets under management. Notably, this figure includes more than $23.2 billion in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC. Ether ETFs Regain Momentum Amid Regulatory Clarity Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. also showed signs of strength, posting three consecutive days of net inflows from June 16 to 18 after a brief pause. On Wednesday alone, the products saw over $19.1 million in new capital. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to lead among Ether funds, maintaining an inflow streak on every trading day except two since May 20. Industry analysts say renewed confidence in Ether ETFs stems from the SEC’s recent clarification that protocol-level staking does not constitute a securities transaction.

That number surpassed the net $30.93 billion worth of stocks that were unloaded by institutions in April and is above the net monthly average in the past year of $42.73 billion. S&P Global notes that institutions dumped equities in May due to trade concerns and Moody’s decision to downgrade the United States’ credit rating from AAA to AA1. Explains Thomas McNamara, an S&P Global director of market intelligence, “Institutions still don’t feel that we are out of the woods in relation to tariffs, recession and overall global uncertainty.” Source: S&P Global/X Conversely, index and exchange-traded fund investors gobbled up a net $11.07 billion in stocks last month and $14.46 billion in April. Both of those numbers are significantly less than the 12-month average of $29.44 billion, however. McNamara says it is “never zero-sum” in terms of stock sales. “There are a lot of factors that go into this on a general basis, but this month, a main driver was share buybacks. This may also be a reason why the market rebounded like it did without any long-only conviction.” The S&P 500 is up 0.25% in the past month, and the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 1.6%, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by nearly 1.4%.

2025-06-19T14:23:10,"FED Rate Cut Hopes Postponed to September! How Will Bitcoin Be Affected? Here Are Analysts' Views!","The US Federal Reserve (FED) kept its policy rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, in line with expectations. This decision, which coincided with analyst estimates and CME FedWatch data, caused markets to turn their eyes to September. Bitcoin Sideways: Fed Rate Cut Hopes Shift to September, Seasonal Pressures Continue FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his post-meeting press conference that there was a “downward trend” in inflation. But he noted there was still room to keep rates high because of strong employment and consumer spending. “The Fed has no immediate plans to cut interest rates. The 'wait-and-see' approach continues and it has become clear that the first cut will not occur before September,” said Valentin Fournier, chief analyst at BRN. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut at the FOMC meeting on September 17 is priced in at 62%. Following the Fed’s decision, there was no significant movement in the US stock and futures markets. Similarly, limited price movements were seen in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was trading sideways at $105,000, while Ethereum and XRP also failed to find a significant direction. Could Demand for Bitcoin Increase? David Hernandez, Crypto Investment Expert at 21Shares, stated that the Fed’s policy stance could create a positive backdrop for Bitcoin. “The slowdown in economic growth and persistently high unemployment are increasing stagflation pressure. In such an environment, demand for decentralized, limited-supply assets like Bitcoin could increase,” he said. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates eight times since June 2024 and the Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates to zero, reinforcing the possibility that global liquidity will turn to crypto markets. According to Hernandez, “Bitcoin’s borderless nature makes it flexible to different central bank policies.” Warning of Weak Volume in Summer On the other hand, seasonal risks are on the agenda for the crypto market in the short term. QCP Capital said that investors are acting cautiously, stating that historically trading volumes have decreased in the summer months and the put-call premium rate has increased in the Bitcoin options market. In addition, month-end portfolio rebalancing and reduction of leveraged transactions stand out as additional pressure factors. Summary The Fed has kept interest rates steady, eyes on September for the first cut. Bitcoin is trading sideways at $105,000. Institutional analysts predict that demand for BTC may increase in a stagflation environment. European and Swiss rate cuts increase the likelihood of liquidity flowing into crypto. The summer period may be marked by seasonal stagnation and cautious trading strategies. In an environment of increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as an alternative safe haven for institutional investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T14:21:54,"XRP Price Prediction: SEC Steps In as Franklin ETF Proposal Advances – Could XRP Overtake Bitcoin?","The XRP price has slipped by 3% in the past 24 hours, falling to $2.16 on a day when the crypto market as a whole drops by 4%. XRP is now down by 6% in a week and by 7% in a month, yet yesterday saw the SEC take a step which may ultimately prove positive for the altcoin. The regulator announced that it’s reviewing a rule change proposed by Franklin Templeton in relation to the latter’s XRP ETF, with this announcement serving as an important step towards possible approval for the ETF. And with several other XRP ETFs also waiting in the wings, the later months of 2025 could end up being massive for the coin, pointing towards a hugely positive long-term XRP price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: SEC Steps In as Franklin ETF Proposal Advances – Could XRP Overtake Bitcoin? On the one hand, the SEC initiating its review of Franklin’s proposed rule change is a mere formality, and doesn’t guarantee approval of the ETF. On the other, it shows that things are moving forwards, after the regulator, in May, pushed back its deadline for reaching a decision on the fund.

(@SerezoFO) June 18, 2025 It’s currently seeking input from interested parties on the ETF in general and on the rule change, which relates to listing the fund on the CBOE exchange. Other details are currently scarce, so it’s still too early at this juncture to say whether the Franklin ETF – and other XRP ETFs – will gain acceptance. Regardless, things have been looking very positive for XRP in general in recent weeks, and not simply because there are a total of ten XRP ETFs under review . We have also seen three publicly listed firms announce plans to open XRP strategic reserves , while Ripple has been expanding its business in Dubai and elsewhere.

In particular, its resistance (red) and support (green) levels are very close to converging on each other, creating a pinch point that could force XRP to make a big move. Source: TradingView Given that XRP’s relative strength index (purple) has been below 50 for much of the time since early February, it’s arguable that such a move will be upwards. It could reach $3 by the end of August, while the approval of the Franklin Templeton ETF (and other XRP ETFs) could see it hit $4 by the end of 2025. Snorter Token Raises $1 Million for Trading Bot: Most Exciting New Meme Coin of the Summer? There’s no doubt that XRP could be one of the best-performing major coins of 2025, with the alt potentially on course to flip Tether and even Ethereum. However, it won’t be the only alt to do well this summer, with several presale coins looking as though they might rally hard once they list for the first time. A good example of this is Snorter (SNORT), an Ethereum- and Solana-based meme coin that has now raised just over $1 million in its ICO. Just raised a milli.

Its bot will offer a range of advantageous features, including automated sniping (so that users can buy coins before they surge), copy trading, limit orders, atomic swaps, and rugpull protection. This gives SNORT plenty of utility, with the coin serving to pay for access to such features, while also be open staking. It will have a max supply of 500 million SNORT, with a Solana version of the coin rolling out soon after the initial launch of its Ethereum-based version. Investors can buy SNORT now by going to the Snorter website and connecting a compatible wallet. It’s currently selling at $0.0955, although this price will rise tomorrow, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

2025-06-19T14:21:46,"Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction for 2030","Prominent investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has doubled down on his Bitcoin ( BTC ) predictions with a fresh BTC target price for 2030. As he claimed in a post on X, when Kiyosaki started trading, Bitcoin went for $6,000 per coin. Today, the price is almost 18 times as high. Looking five years ahead, the forecast by the author implies no less than an 895% increase from Bitcoin’s current price of around $104,786 at press time on June 19. Indeed, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. While the numbers might seem incredible, Kiyosaki believes such growth is plausible as ownership volume matters more than the current price. In his own words: “While price is important …. the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin. How many ounces of gold and silver and Bitcoin do you own? The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices.” PRICE vs QUANTITY Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity. I do not care much about the spot price of gold or silver. I do care about how many ounces of gold and silver I control. The same with Bitcoin. While I watch the price of Bitcoin I focus on how many… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 18, 2025 Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin stance Kiyosaki’s emphasis on how much of each asset one owns implies that he sees Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and fiat currency devaluation. Indeed, a known critic of fiat, the financial educator urged his followers in the same post to put their trust in hard assets instead of “fake money.” The admonition retireates Kiyosaki’s June 2 statement about the unfolding global crisis presenting as a potential opportunity for proactive investors. Do not say I didn’t warn anyone. As predicted in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy (2013) the biggest crash in history is coming. I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer. Unfortunately, millions, especially my generation of boomers will be wiped out when the… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 2, 2025 As he put it: “Millions who are proactive may become extremely rich… Billions will rush into gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” At the start of June, Kiyosaki singled out silver as the “biggest bargain,” but considering his most recent Bitcoin predictions, “Digital Gold” might have taken that spot.

According to a press release shared with crypto.news on June 19, XBTO has partnered with Arab Bank Switzerland to roll out a new Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield product, marking one of the first instances of a traditional Swiss private bank offering such a service directly to clients. The product, designed for high-net-worth individuals seeking yield on idle Bitcoin, combines the bank’s established digital asset infrastructure with XBTO’s proprietary “Diamond Hands” strategy, an options-based approach aimed at generating yield while accumulating Bitcoin during market dips. You might also like: Bubblemaps V2 goes live on Open Network Romain Braud, Head of Digital Assets at Arab Bank Switzerland, said the offering is fully integrated into the bank’s wealth management services, ensuring institutional oversight and regulatory compliance. “We have seen growing demand from our wealth management clients for ways to generate yield on their Bitcoin holdings within a properly managed risk framework. This collaboration will position Arab Bank Switzerland as the first traditional Swiss private bank to offer an integrated, bank-branded Bitcoin yield product, while maintaining the personal relationship and fiduciary care clients expect from private banking,” Braud noted. The partnership represents a significant step in crypto’s slow but steady penetration into the private banking mainstream. While institutions have dipped their toes into custody and token exposure, few have ventured into active yield strategies under a regulated, client-facing structure. For Arab Bank Switzerland, the development builds on its Bitcoin custody services, which it has offered through a partnership with Taurus since 2019. The move could pressure competitors to follow suit, accelerating crypto’s assimilation into private banking’s inner sanctum. At the same time, XBTO has further cemented its role as a bridge between institutional crypto strategies and traditional wealth management.

2025-06-19T14:10:45,"Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Astonishing Growth Reveals Unshakeable HODL Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Astonishing Growth Reveals Unshakeable HODL Conviction Have you ever wondered what happens to Bitcoin that just sits untouched for years? In the fast-paced world of crypto, it’s easy to focus on daily price swings and trading volumes. But a fascinating trend is quietly unfolding that speaks volumes about the conviction of early adopters and long-term investors: the significant growth in the Bitcoin dormant supply . What Exactly is the Bitcoin Dormant Supply? When we talk about the Bitcoin dormant supply , we’re referring to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from its wallet address for a significant period. The most compelling category, and the focus of recent analysis, is Bitcoin that has remained untouched for over 10 years . Think of these coins as digital artifacts, relics from Bitcoin’s earliest days, held by individuals who acquired them long before Bitcoin became a household name. This category is particularly interesting because coins held for such an extended time are less likely to be part of active trading strategies. They represent a deep, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s future value, often associated with what the crypto community affectionately calls “ Bitcoin long-term holders ” or simply “HODLers” (Hold On for Dear Life). The Astonishing Growth: More Dormant Than Newly Mined? Recent data from a Fidelity Digital Assets report, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a truly striking trend. Since April 2024, an average of approximately 566 Bitcoin that has remained unmoved for over a decade has been added to this “ancient supply” category every single day . To put this into perspective, consider the current rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Following the latest BTC halving event in April 2024, the reward for miners was cut in half. Miners now collectively earn around 450 Bitcoin per day (block reward of 3.125 BTC every ~10 minutes). The fact that the volume of Bitcoin becoming dormant for over 10 years surpasses the current daily issuance by miners is a powerful indicator of accumulation and holding behaviour. Here’s a simple comparison: Metric Approximate Daily BTC Amount (Since April 2024) New BTC Issued by Miners ~450 BTC BTC Becoming 10+ Years Dormant ~566 BTC This dynamic suggests that more Bitcoin is moving into the category of long-term, likely inaccessible or deeply held supply, than is being created each day. This has significant implications for overall Bitcoin supply dynamics . The Ever-Growing Treasure Trove of Ancient Bitcoin According to the Fidelity report, this ancient supply now represents a substantial portion of the total BTC supply that has ever been mined. It accounts for more than 17% of all mined Bitcoin , which is roughly 3.4 million BTC. Valuing this ancient hoard is difficult given Bitcoin’s price volatility. The report cited a value of approximately $360 billion based on a price of $107,000 per coin at the time of their analysis. While the price fluctuates, the sheer volume of 3.4 million BTC sitting unmoved for a decade highlights the immense value locked away by these conviction-driven holders. Why Are So Many Bitcoins Becoming Dormant? The Power of Bitcoin HODL The primary driver behind the growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply is the strong conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders . These individuals aren’t looking for quick profits. They likely acquired their Bitcoin when the price was significantly lower and have weathered multiple market cycles, corrections, and periods of intense volatility. Their decision not to move or sell their Bitcoin for over a decade indicates several possibilities: Unshakeable Belief: They hold a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as digital gold or a global reserve asset. Early Acquisition: Many of these coins were mined or purchased in Bitcoin’s infancy, potentially at very low costs, reducing the pressure to sell for profit. Lost or Inaccessible Keys: Sadly, some portion of this dormant supply may represent coins whose private keys have been lost or forgotten over the years. Estate Planning/Inheritance: Some may be held within long-term estate plans, intended for future generations. Strategic Holding: Sophisticated investors or entities might be intentionally holding large amounts off-exchange as a long-term strategic allocation. Regardless of the exact reason, the sheer volume of Bitcoin remaining dormant for so long is a powerful testament to the Bitcoin HODL philosophy and reduces the potentially available supply on exchanges. Future Projections and the Impact of the BTC Halving The Fidelity report makes compelling projections about the future growth of this ancient supply, largely influenced by the predictable nature of the BTC halving schedule. As time passes, more and more existing Bitcoin will cross the 10-year threshold, automatically adding to the dormant count, while the rate of new Bitcoin creation continues to decrease every four years due to the halving. Fidelity projects that the ancient supply’s share of the total mined BTC supply could rise to: 20% by 2028: The year of the next anticipated BTC halving . 25% by 2034: Further increasing its dominance over the newly issued supply. This interaction between the fixed issuance schedule dictated by the BTC halving and the behaviour of Bitcoin long-term holders profoundly impacts Bitcoin supply dynamics . As the rate of new supply shrinks and the amount of old, unmoved supply grows, the effectively available supply for trading and new investment becomes increasingly scarce. Implications for Bitcoin Supply Dynamics and the Market The consistent growth of the Bitcoin dormant supply has several key implications for the market: Reduced Selling Pressure: Coins held for over 10 years are statistically far less likely to be sold in response to market fluctuations compared to newer coins or those held by short-term traders. This removes a significant potential source of selling pressure from the market. Increased Scarcity: While Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million, the circulating and *actively traded* supply is what truly matters for price discovery. As the dormant supply grows, the effectively available supply becomes scarcer, which can be a bullish factor assuming demand remains constant or increases. Indicator of Conviction: The trend serves as a strong signal of confidence from some of the earliest and most resilient Bitcoin holders. Their unwillingness to sell, even after immense price appreciation, speaks to a belief in even greater future value. Understanding these Bitcoin supply dynamics is crucial for anyone trying to grasp Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. It’s not just about how much Bitcoin exists, but how much is actually in active circulation. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Dormant Supply? While the growth in Bitcoin dormant supply is often seen as a positive indicator of strong holding conviction, it’s not without potential considerations: Lost Access: As mentioned, some portion is likely lost forever due to lost keys. This permanently removes those coins from circulation. Future Movement: While unlikely for the majority, a sudden need or decision by a large, ancient holder to move or sell a significant amount of Bitcoin could potentially impact the market, although the logistics of selling such a large amount without impacting the price are challenging. Concentration Risk: A large amount of supply is concentrated in the hands of early holders. While they have demonstrated resilience, this concentration is a factor in the overall supply distribution. However, the consistent growth of this category suggests that for every holder who might lose access or eventually sell, there are many more who remain steadfast in their Bitcoin HODL strategy. Conclusion: The Silent Strength of Bitcoin’s Ancient Supply The recent data showing Bitcoin dormant supply growing faster than new coins are mined is a powerful narrative. It underscores the unwavering conviction of Bitcoin long-term holders and highlights the unique Bitcoin supply dynamics at play, particularly in the wake of the latest BTC halving . As Fidelity projects this ancient supply to constitute an even larger percentage of the total BTC supply in the coming years, the scarcity factor becomes increasingly pronounced. The trend of deep-seated Bitcoin HODL isn’t just a meme; it’s a quantifiable force shaping the future availability and potential value of Bitcoin. This growth in dormant supply, exceeding the rate of new issuance, is a silent but strong indicator of the market’s long-term perspective on Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that beneath the daily noise, a significant portion of the network’s value is held by those who believe in its transformative potential over decades, not just days or months.

2025-06-19T14:09:22,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Price Action Remains Flat As Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady","Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below $105,000 since Tuesday as growing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating geopolitical tensions seem to have taken the wind out of the flagship cryptocurrency’s sails. BTC has struggled to gain momentum since dropping below $110,000 on Wednesday (June 11). It plunged to a low of $102,854 before recovering and moving to current levels, marginally down over the past 24 hours as it struggles to reclaim $105,000. Trump Furious At Fed Rate Cut Stance US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates. The Fed left interest rates unchanged again, prompting Trump to take to Truth Social and criticize Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump posted, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy who’s costing America $Billions!” He also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site. The article quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator, who called for Powell to step down if he kept interest rates steady. The decision left Bitcoin at a standstill. BTC has hovered around $104,000-$105,000 since the Fed voted to maintain its current monetary policy in June. Analysts believe the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s price action, much to the dismay of traders. Fed Chair Jerome Powell justified keeping interest rates steady, adding that “policymakers are well-positioned to wait” before moving further on interest rates. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be. I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects.” Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, between 4.25% and 4.50%, expecting elevated inflation and slowed economic growth. However, the Fed expects to make two rate cuts later this year. However, it removed one reduction for 2026 and 2027, putting the expected future rate cuts at four or one percentage point. The Reserve's “dot plot” indicated continued uncertainty about future rate cuts. Each dot represents an official’s expectations for rates. Seven of the nineteen participants indicated they did not want any cuts this year. However, the Committee unanimously approved the policy statement. The FOMC stated, “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated there was time to wait for more clarity, stating, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their inflow streak, recording their eighth day of inflows despite Middle East tensions. The ETFs recorded $388.3 million in inflows on Wednesday, as institutional interest shows no sign of waning. According to data from Farside, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), led with $278.9 million and $104.4 million in inflows. The strong inflows reiterate the fact that institutional interest and confidence in BTC remains strong. Crypto analytics platform Santiment stated, “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104K-$105K range, aided by consistent ETF inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum as resistance around $105,000-$106,000 blocks a move past $110,000. Rising macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating Middle East tensions have pushed investors into a “wait-and-watch” approach, thanks to market uncertainty. As a result, BTC’s bull run has hit pause, with the $112,000 level proving to be a stubborn barrier. Rising geopolitical tensions, including the Israel-Iran conflict, have created a risk-off sentiment among investors. As a result, they have pivoted to traditional safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys, with gold nearing all-time highs this week. BTC and other risk assets have faced reduced demand in recent sessions, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping nearly 4% since Israel’s first attack on Iran. The Nobitex hack added to the pressure, further weighing down the price. The Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged has also dampened momentum. The Fed’s cautious approach is due to persistent inflation and concerns about tariff-induced pressures under the Trump administration. These concerns have also reduced expectations of a Fed rate cut in 2025. The Fed’s restrictive monetary policy strengthens the US Dollar and pressures risk assets like BTC . Market watchers believe the circumstances in which the Fed is fighting inflation are exceptional. QCP Capital stated in a note, “This is no ordinary inflation fight. Our base case is that the Fed may adopt a more cautious tone in its September, potentially indicating a single rate cut for 2025, in contrast to market pricing. Such a revision would likely pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin and broader digital assets, as liquidity expectations are pared back.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to surge past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday and fell 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC dropped nearly 1% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as markets turned bearish. As a result, the price fell over 2%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,519. BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering a marginal increase and moving to $104,884. The current session sees BTC down 0.50%, trading around $104,358. If BTC slips below $103,000, it could drop to $100,000 or lower. On the other hand, if buyers regain momentum and push above $106,000, BTC could move to $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-19T14:07:24,"7 Votes Saved Czech Government from Being Ousted Over Bitcoin-Related Scandal","The Czech coalition government survived the no-confidence vote on Wednesday, with fewer than half of the parliamentarians voting ‘aye’. This all began with a Bitcoin scandal. After two days of discussions in the Czech lower house of Parliament, 94 officials from the opposition party voted in favor of forcing out the government, the AP reported . However, for that to happen, the opposition needed 101 out of the 200 seats. Source: Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Twitter Notably, this is not the first such motion over the past four years. It’s the fourth since this four-party coalition government took leadership. Moreover, the next parliamentary election is set for early October, with the opposition likely to win. Earlier this year, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek accepted a large donation in BTC, which he sold for about $45.8 million in March. In May, the opposition raised concerns over the source of the donation, and by the end of the month, Blažek resigned. The main opposition centrist ANO (YES) movement, with billionaire Andrej Babiš at the helm, requested a vote of no-confidence, looking to oust the current government. Subsequently, Eva Decroix, deputy chair of the Civic Democratic Party, has been appointed as the country’s new Minister of Justice.

On Friday, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned, with the opposition set to demand the resignation of the coalition government this week as well.The situation caught on fire at the end of last week after Blažek, a conservative politician, accepted a large donation in BTC and sold it for about $45.8 million in March, the AP reported. The opposition has raised concerns over the source of the donation.Blažek received the coins... So, How is BTC Involved? In March 2025, a lawyer representing Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal, reportedly approached Blažek, saying that the client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Before his arrest, Jirikovsky had operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Police confiscated his wallet containing BTC but returned it after his release in 2021. The opposition party raised concerns over the origin of this donated BTC , since Blažek did not do any checks. But Blažek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. “I have no way to investigate the matter, and I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” he said. Blažek also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus, a dark web marketplace that reportedly shut its doors the day after Jirikovsky’s arrest. Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC, dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Blažek claimed he hadn’t made any promises in return for the donation.

2025-06-19T04:13:16,"ETH Technical Analysis with tradeCompass","<p>Ethereum Technical Analysis Today with tradeCompass – June 19, 2025</p><p>At the time of this Ethereum technical analysis, ETH futures are trading near $2,525, just below the key bullish threshold. Following the FOMC meeting, broader sentiment in equity markets is mildly negative, with Nasdaq futures down 0.32%. While this isn’t an outright bearish signal, it does keep traders cautious—yet open to directional setups as the session unfolds.</p><p>tradeCompass Summary – June 19, 2025</p><p>Bullish above: $2,557
Bearish below: $2,504.75
Current price: $2,525
Market sentiment: Slightly bearish but undecided</p><p>ETH remains caught between thresholds, so price action near either edge will define the day's bias. Once confirmed, the tradeCompass methodology provides a clear roadmap for execution and partial profit-taking.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bullish Profit Targets</p><p>If Ethereum futures cross and hold above $2,557, the following targets apply:</p><p>$2,567
Quick initial target at the 3rd upper standard deviation of yesterday’s VWAP. Good for immediate risk reduction.</p><p>$2,589
A high-volume node where previous reactions occurred. Expect potential stall or partial unwind.</p><p>$2,604.5
Just below the value area high (VAH) from two days ago. This is a meaningful structural level in Ethereum technical analysis.</p><p>$2,625
Near the VWAP from June 16, often acting as a magnet or inflection point.</p><p>$2,664
Just under the June 16 VAH, where larger players may rotate out or fade moves.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,850
A longer-term swing target if bullish momentum accelerates. This level aligns with broader trend continuation potential.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bearish Profit Targets</p><p>If price breaks below $2,504.75 and confirms momentum:</p><p>$2,499
First quick drop zone, likely to capture trapped longs.</p><p>$2,488.5
Aligned with yesterday’s value area low, this is a standard partial-profit point.</p><p>$2,474.5
Matches prior lows and the second lower deviation of yesterday’s VWAP—expect bounces or reversals here.</p><p>$2,456.7
Just above the third lower VWAP deviation, a high-risk but high-reward target for aggressive shorts.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,315
Backed by volume profile clusters from May 9. A valid swing target if broader risk sentiment deteriorates.</p><p>Extreme Runner: $2,160
This level, ~14.3% below the current price, would require significant breakdown and would only be reached in an extended bearish cycle.</p><p>Understanding tradeCompass: A Professional Technical Framework</p><p>The tradeCompass method integrates:</p><ul><li><p>Volume Profile (VAH, VAL, POC): Highlights areas of price acceptance and rejection</p></li><li><p>VWAP and Standard Deviations: Frames intraday fair value and volatility-based bands</p></li><li><p>Liquidity Zones & Round Numbers: Identifies where market makers and algorithms operate</p></li><li><p>Partial Profit-Taking Strategy: Reduces risk exposure while maximizing opportunity</p></li></ul><p>By defining clear bullish/bearish thresholds and structured exit levels, it reduces overtrading and guides disciplined execution.</p><p>Ethereum Technical Outlook – Use tradeCompass as a Map</p><p>The $2,557 and $2,504.75 levels act as directional decision points. Wait for price confirmation around these lines to engage. Remember, this isn't just a prediction—it's a map for navigating uncertainty. If price fails to break out, patience is a better trade.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>This Ethereum technical analysis offers a decision-support framework, not financial advice.
