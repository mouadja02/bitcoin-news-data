2025-06-19T08:50:22,"Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury Imagine a digital asset, born from the world of Cryptocurrency , that doesn’t just coexist with traditional finance but actively works to strengthen the bedrock of the global economy – the US Dollar . This isn’t a far-fetched concept; it’s a perspective recently highlighted by a key figure in U.S. financial policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that Stablecoins could play a significant role in reinforcing the US Dollar ’s global supremacy, primarily by becoming substantial buyers of US Treasury assets. This view from such a high-level official underscores the evolving perception of digital assets within traditional financial corridors and their potential impact on global Financial Stability . Why Does the US Treasury See Value in Stablecoins? The statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as reported by The Block, is noteworthy because it comes from an institution historically cautious about the volatile nature of Cryptocurrency . His perspective centers on a specific, often overlooked, aspect of certain Stablecoins : their reserve holdings. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US Dollar . To maintain this peg, issuers hold reserves. For the most popular dollar-pegged Stablecoins , these reserves often include highly liquid, low-risk assets – and U.S. Treasurys are a prime example. The logic is straightforward: as the market capitalization of dollar-pegged Stablecoins grows, the demand for the assets held in their reserves also increases. If a significant portion of these reserves is held in US Treasury securities, then the growth of the Stablecoin market translates directly into increased demand for U.S. government debt. This increased demand has several potential benefits for the US Treasury and the broader U.S. economy. Stablecoins and the US Dollar: A Digital Alliance? The US Dollar has long held the position of the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. This dominance provides significant economic and geopolitical advantages to the United States. In a rapidly digitizing global economy, maintaining this position requires the dollar to be easily accessible and usable in digital forms. While discussions around a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) continue, Stablecoins offer an existing, market-driven solution for digital dollar transactions. Here’s how Stablecoins can potentially strengthen the US Dollar ‘s global position: Increased Demand for Dollar-Denominated Assets: As mentioned, the reserve requirements of dollar-pegged Stablecoins create direct demand for dollar-denominated assets, including US Treasury securities. This reinforces the dollar’s status as a store of value. Enhanced Digital Accessibility: Stablecoins facilitate faster, cheaper, and more programmable transactions globally compared to traditional cross-border payment systems. This makes the digital dollar more attractive and easier to use for international commerce and remittances, potentially extending the dollar’s reach in new markets and digital economies. Alternative to Foreign Currencies in Digital Trade: In the absence of easy access to digital dollars via Stablecoins , users in digital ecosystems might opt for other currencies or assets. The availability of reliable dollar-pegged Stablecoins ensures the dollar remains the preferred medium of exchange in these growing digital spaces. Innovation Hub: The innovation spurred by the Stablecoin market within the U.S. regulatory framework (or proposed frameworks) can help maintain the U.S. as a leader in financial technology, further solidifying the dollar’s role. Secretary Bessent’s focus on US Treasury purchases highlights a tangible mechanism through which Stablecoins can provide direct economic benefit to the U.S. government by supporting its debt market. This is a different angle than just facilitating payments; it speaks to the underlying financial infrastructure that supports the dollar’s strength. Impact on the US Treasury and Financial Stability The sheer scale of the Stablecoin market means their reserve holdings are becoming increasingly significant. Major dollar-pegged Stablecoins represent tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization, and a substantial portion of this is held in assets like commercial paper, bank deposits, and critically, US Treasury bills and notes. Consider the implications for the US Treasury : New Source of Demand: As the Stablecoin market grows, it introduces a new, potentially large, and consistent buyer base for U.S. government debt. This diversification of buyers can be beneficial for market stability. Potential Impact on Borrowing Costs: Increased demand for Treasurys generally leads to higher prices for those securities, which translates to lower yields (interest rates) for the government when it borrows money. If Stablecoins become significant buyers, they could help keep U.S. borrowing costs lower than they otherwise might be. Reinforcing Market Depth and Liquidity: Large, active buyers contribute to the overall depth and liquidity of the US Treasury market, making it easier for the U.S. government to issue debt and for investors to trade it. This is crucial for maintaining Financial Stability . The idea that a technology born from the volatile world of Cryptocurrency could become a pillar of support for the highly traditional US Treasury market is a powerful testament to the potential for convergence between these two worlds. It underscores the need for policymakers to understand these new dynamics rather than simply viewing Cryptocurrency through a lens of risk. Stablecoins, Cryptocurrency, and the Path Forward Secretary Bessent’s comments signal a growing recognition within government that certain aspects of Cryptocurrency , specifically well-regulated and transparent Stablecoins , could be integrated into the existing financial system in beneficial ways. This perspective is vital for fostering a productive dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry. However, this potential doesn’t come without challenges. For Stablecoins to truly contribute to Financial Stability and strengthen the US Dollar and US Treasury , several key areas need attention: Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Clarity: A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for Stablecoins is essential. This includes rules around reserve requirements, auditing, redemption rights, and overall risk management to prevent failures that could harm users and potentially spill over into traditional markets. Reserve Management Risks: The quality and management of Stablecoin reserves are paramount. Lack of transparency or holding risky assets could undermine confidence and pose systemic risks if the market grows large enough. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that users understand the risks associated with Stablecoins and have adequate protections is crucial for building trust and encouraging adoption. Interoperability: Developing standards for how Stablecoins interact with traditional payment systems and other digital asset platforms will be key to their widespread utility. The conversation initiated by figures like Secretary Bessent moves beyond simply debating the merits of Bitcoin or the volatility of the broader Cryptocurrency market. It focuses on the specific utility and potential economic benefits that a particular class of digital asset – Stablecoins – can offer to the established financial order. This nuanced view is critical for developing regulation that fosters innovation while managing risk. Actionable Insights from the Treasury’s View What does this perspective from the U.S. Treasury mean for different stakeholders? For Policymakers: It reinforces the urgency of developing tailored, risk-based regulation for Stablecoins that acknowledges their potential benefits while mitigating risks. Collaboration with international bodies is also key to ensure global consistency. For the Cryptocurrency Industry: It highlights the importance of building transparent, well-managed Stablecoin projects that can demonstrate their safety and soundness to regulators and the public. Engaging constructively with policymakers is vital. For Investors and Users: It underscores the growing intersection between traditional finance and Cryptocurrency . Understanding how assets like Stablecoins fit into the broader financial ecosystem, including their role in reserve markets like US Treasury , is increasingly important. It also emphasizes the need to choose Stablecoins from reputable issuers with clear reserve policies. For Traditional Financial Institutions: It signals potential opportunities for collaboration and integration, particularly in areas like digital payments, asset tokenization, and participation in digital asset markets. The Secretary’s comments suggest a future where Stablecoins are not just tolerated but potentially embraced as tools that can enhance the existing financial infrastructure and reinforce the global standing of the US Dollar . This requires careful navigation of the regulatory landscape and continued innovation in building secure and reliable digital asset systems. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Stablecoins and the Dollar U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s view that Stablecoins can strengthen the US Dollar ’s global dominance by boosting demand for US Treasury assets marks a significant moment in the dialogue between government and the digital asset world. It shifts the focus from the speculative aspects of Cryptocurrency to the potential utility and economic benefits of Stablecoins as a digital form of the dollar and a new source of demand for U.S. government debt. While challenges related to regulation, risk management, and consumer protection remain, the recognition from a high-level official like Secretary Bessent highlights the potential for Stablecoins to become an integrated part of the global financial architecture, reinforcing the US Dollar ‘s position and contributing to overall Financial Stability . The path forward requires careful consideration, collaboration, and a commitment to building robust and transparent systems that can harness the power of digital innovation for the benefit of the traditional economy.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) cut its interest rate to zero on Thursday, to counter falling inflation, appreciating Swiss franc (CHF) and economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s trade war. The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China. The latest rate cut is bank’s sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024. The SNB’s return to zero may be a sign of things to come across Europe and other advanced nations.

""I Want It On My Desk ASAP!""","In the USA, the cryptocurrency-friendly stablecoin law GENIUS Act received approval from the Senate after long efforts. At this point, there is one last stage left for GENIUS, which US President Donald Trump plans to approve by August. The GENIUS law must also receive approval from the House of Representatives before it can be signed by Trump. Now, as all eyes turn to the House of Representatives, a new statement came from Donald Trump. Accordingly, Trump, in his post on his Truth Social account, asked the House of Representatives to move quickly for the final signature of the GENIUS Act and urged it to pass as soon as possible. Trump stated that the Senate passed an incredible bill that would make the United States the undisputed leader in the field of digital assets. Describing the bill as pure genius, Trump said GENIIUS would bring major investments and major innovations to the United States. “….There will be no country that can do better than this. (This bill) is truly a genius idea. Get this to my desk now — NO DELAY, NO ADD-ON. With this I will show the world how to earn with digital assets like never before.” The GENIUS law imposes strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compulsory licensing, full reserve support, annual audits for issuers with a market value of over $50 billion, and regulatory oversight by foreign entities. The stablecoin bill GENIUS passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote and now awaits a vote in the House of Representatives. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T08:40:17,"Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Why the Crypto Market is in Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Why the Crypto Market is in Bitcoin Season Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wondered whether it’s the season for Altcoins to shine or for Bitcoin to lead the charge? There’s a handy tool many in the community watch: the Altcoin Season Index . And right now, according to the latest data, this key metric is signaling a specific phase for the crypto market . As of 00:38 UTC on June 19, the Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap, registered a reading of 22. This is a slight uptick from the previous day but firmly places the market in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does that mean for your portfolio and the broader digital asset landscape? What is the Altcoin Season Index? Understanding the Metric Before we dive into what a reading of 22 signifies, let’s break down this crucial index. The Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a specific metric designed to gauge the relative performance of major Altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a defined period. The Source: It’s tracked by reputable platforms like CoinMarketCap, providing data based on a broad spectrum of the market. The Scope: The index focuses on the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The Timeframe: It analyzes performance over the past 90 days. This rolling window provides a dynamic view of recent market trends rather than a static snapshot. The Comparison: The core of the index is a direct comparison: How many of these top 100 Altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window? Think of it like a scorecard where each of the top 100 non-stablecoin/wrapped tokens gets a point if it has performed better than Bitcoin over the last three months. The index score is essentially the percentage of these Altcoins that have beaten Bitcoin. Decoding the Seasons: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Thresholds The Altcoin Season Index uses specific thresholds to define the prevailing market ‘season’. These thresholds provide clear markers for investors to understand whether Altcoins or Bitcoin are currently leading the market momentum. Here’s how the seasons are defined: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 Altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season. During this phase, we typically see significant rallies across a broad range of Altcoins, sometimes with many experiencing parabolic growth. Bitcoin Season: This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 Altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score of 25 or lower signals Bitcoin Season . In this environment, Bitcoin often dominates the market narrative and capital flows, either holding value better during downturns or leading during uptrends, while many Altcoins may lag behind or even lose value against Bitcoin. Neither Season (or ‘Other’): If the index falls between 26 and 74, the market isn’t clearly in either Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season. This period can be characterized by choppy price action, sector rotation, or a less defined market trend where performance is more mixed across different assets. So, with the index currently sitting at 22, the data explicitly tells us the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . Why the Current Reading of 22 Signals Bitcoin Season A reading of 22 means that over the last 90 days, only 22% of the top 100 eligible Altcoins have managed to perform better than Bitcoin . This is significantly below the 75% threshold required for Altcoin Season and falls squarely within the Bitcoin Season . What does this performance gap suggest? It indicates that capital has likely been flowing disproportionately into Bitcoin , or perhaps flowing out of Altcoins faster than out of Bitcoin. This could be due to several factors: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of uncertainty in the broader financial markets or even within the crypto space, investors often flock to Bitcoin as the most established and liquid digital asset, viewing it as a relatively ‘safer’ store of value compared to more volatile Altcoins. Institutional Interest: Much of the recent institutional investment has been focused primarily on Bitcoin, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions. Large capital inflows into Bitcoin naturally increase its market dominance and can pull performance away from Altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in interest rates, inflation data, or global economic outlook can influence investor risk appetite. During periods of heightened caution, riskier assets (which Altcoins are generally perceived to be compared to Bitcoin) tend to underperform. Post-Halving Dynamics: Following a Bitcoin halving event, historical patterns often show a period where Bitcoin consolidates or makes initial moves, with Altcoins potentially lagging before catching up later in the cycle. We are currently in the period following the April 2024 halving. Being in Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean Altcoins are necessarily losing value in absolute terms (though many might). It specifically means they are, on average, underperforming relative to Bitcoin over the past three months. Historical Context: When Have We Seen Altcoin Season Before? Understanding the current state is often best done by looking at the past. True Altcoin Season , where the index consistently stays above 75, is a less frequent phenomenon than periods of Bitcoin dominance or ‘neither season’. Notable periods of strong Altcoin Season include: Late 2017 / Early 2018: This was arguably the most iconic Altcoin Season, fueled by the ICO boom. Many Altcoins saw exponential gains, and the index likely stayed high for a significant period as retail investors piled into virtually anything crypto-related. Mid-2020 to Early 2021: Following the March 2020 crash and leading into Bitcoin’s break of its all-time high, a strong Altcoin Season emerged. This was driven by increased DeFi adoption, the rise of new layer 1s, and renewed retail and institutional interest expanding beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum’s significant rally was a key part of this period, pulling many other Altcoins up with it. Parts of 2021 (e.g., Spring 2021): Even within the broader bull market, there were distinct periods where Altcoins saw explosive growth relative to Bitcoin, often tied to specific narratives like NFTs, specific blockchain ecosystems, or meme coins. These periods were characterized by high market enthusiasm, significant technological developments in the Altcoin space, and often, a feeling that Bitcoin had made its major move and it was ‘time’ for Altcoins to catch up. Conversely, Bitcoin Season often follows periods of high Altcoin euphoria (as capital rotates back to the perceived safety of Bitcoin) or occurs during market downturns or periods of consolidation after a large Bitcoin rally. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Altcoins and Bitcoin Investors So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What should investors and traders consider? This phase of the crypto market presents unique challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Many Altcoins may continue to lose value relative to Bitcoin, meaning even if they go up in dollar terms, they might go down when measured in satoshis (fractions of Bitcoin). Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Altcoins can be more susceptible to sharp drops during Bitcoin consolidations or pullbacks. Difficulty in Picking Winners: While some Altcoins might still perform well based on specific news or developments, a broad-based rally driven by overall market momentum is less likely during Bitcoin Season. Opportunities & Actionable Insights: Accumulate Bitcoin: If you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue or increase, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin during this period might be a primary strategy. Strategic Altcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to buy quality Altcoins at potentially lower prices, especially relative to Bitcoin. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and engaged communities that you believe will perform well when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Reduce Altcoin Exposure: For those with high Altcoin exposure, this might be a time to de-risk slightly by converting some Altcoins back into Bitcoin or stablecoins, especially if you hold Altcoins with weaker fundamentals. Focus on Specific Narratives: While broad Altcoin performance is weak relative to Bitcoin, specific sectors (like AI, DePIN, or specific L2 solutions) might still see bursts of activity. Researching and focusing on these specific narratives could yield results, but carries higher risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regardless of the season, consistently investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of trying to time the market perfectly. This can be applied to both Bitcoin and selected Altcoins. Set Alerts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index itself. A sustained move upwards, particularly towards the 25-30 mark and beyond, could be an early signal that market dynamics are starting to shift. It’s crucial to remember that market cycles are fluid. Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever, just as Altcoin Season doesn’t. The index provides a snapshot of the recent past (90 days) and current momentum, not a guaranteed forecast of the future. Looking Ahead: What Could Trigger the Next Altcoin Season? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the question on many investors’ minds is: When will Altcoin Season return? Predicting market shifts is impossible with certainty, but we can identify potential triggers and signals to watch for: Sustained Decrease in Bitcoin Dominance: The most obvious signal is a downtrend in Bitcoin’s percentage of the total crypto market cap. As Bitcoin’s dominance falls, it typically means capital is rotating into Altcoins. Breakout Performance from Major Altcoins: If Ethereum (ETH) or other large-cap Altcoins start to significantly outperform Bitcoin, it can pull the rest of the market with them. Successful network upgrades (like Ethereum’s future developments) can be catalysts. Emergence of Powerful New Narratives: New technological trends or use cases (like the next wave of DeFi, GameFi, specific Layer 2 solutions, or entirely new concepts) that gain significant traction and investment can drive Altcoin performance. Increased Retail Investor Activity: Altcoin Season is often fueled by retail enthusiasm, as smaller investors are more likely to speculate on lower-priced, higher-potential Altcoins. A surge in retail interest and new money entering the market can be a strong catalyst. Favorable Macroeconomic Conditions: A global economic environment where investors are more willing to take on risk can benefit Altcoins disproportionately. A Significant Bitcoin Rally Followed by Consolidation: Sometimes, Bitcoin makes a large upward move first, drawing attention and capital. Once Bitcoin consolidates at a new high, capital can then flow into Altcoins looking for the ‘next big gain’. Monitoring these potential catalysts alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself can provide valuable clues about potential market shifts. A gradual increase in the index score towards the ‘Neither Season’ zone (26-74) and eventually towards the Altcoin Season threshold (75+) would be a strong indicator that the winds are changing. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market Seasons The Altcoin Season Index provides a data-driven perspective on whether Altcoins or Bitcoin have been the stronger performers recently. Its current reading of 22 clearly indicates that the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season , meaning Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 Altcoins over the past 90 days. This doesn’t mean Altcoins are irrelevant, but it highlights the prevailing market dynamic. For investors, understanding this can inform strategy – whether it’s focusing on Bitcoin accumulation, selectively buying Altcoins with strong conviction at potentially attractive relative prices, or simply exercising caution with broader Altcoin exposure. Market seasons are cyclical. While we are in Bitcoin Season now, the factors driving performance are constantly evolving. Staying informed, understanding the metrics like the Altcoin Season Index , and adapting your strategy based on data and your own risk tolerance are key to navigating the exciting, albeit sometimes challenging, world of cryptocurrency investing.

The Treasury Secretary’s embrace of cryptocurrency as a tool for dollar reinforcement rather than replacement directly contrasts with growing European concerns, as Italy’s Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti warns that U.S. stablecoin policies could pose a “more dangerous impact on the euro than the effects of trade tariffs.” Dollar Supremacy vs. European Monetary Sovereignty The global monetary implications of America’s pro-crypto stance have created a fascinating geopolitical dynamic that extends far beyond traditional trade concerns. European policymakers recognize that digital assets represent a new front in currency competition. Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, warned that the Trump administration’s favorable approach toward dollar-denominated stablecoins could affect the eurozone’s “monetary sovereignty and financial stability” by encouraging the adoption of alternative payment methods that bypass European financial institutions entirely. Italy’s Giorgetti articulated the most direct challenge to European monetary policy, explaining how U.S. stablecoin policies inadvertently offer European savers a pathway to invest in risk-free dollar-denominated assets without requiring banking relationships with American institutions. This development threatens to fragment Europe’s payment industry while strengthening the dollar’s role as the preferred store of value for international transactions. Does Europe really need a digital euro? Experts weigh in on privacy, regulation, and the role of stablecoins at UN:BLOCK crypto conference #DigitalEuro #CBDC https://t.co/sjQoXA1ayi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 The concern has prompted the European Central Bank to accelerate its digital euro project , though implementation remains years away, with a rollout not anticipated until 2028 or 2029. While Europe sees it as a threat, the pent-up demand for clarity and the GENIUS Act’s comprehensive framework could trigger a wave of institutional adoption that further entrenches dollar-denominated stablecoins as the backbone of global crypto trading and cross-border payments. GENIUS Act Near Victory Amid Political Controversy The GENIUS Act’s path to approval has been marked by intense partisan debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren led Democratic opposition by highlighting potential conflicts of interest related to Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures. Warren’s concerns center on Trump’s USD1 stablecoin, which reportedly generated $57 million last year through the World Liberty Financial platform. This raises questions about whether the president could profit from legislation he signs into law. Despite these objections, 18 Democrats joined most Republicans in supporting the Senate version. Senator Cynthia Lummis has emerged as a key advocate for broader crypto legislation , arguing that while the GENIUS Act represents progress, comprehensive market structure legislation remains necessary to establish the United States as the global “crypto capital.” Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill @POTUS ' vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world. pic.twitter.com/tyz6Kbc5qK — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 18, 2025 Trump’s urgent call for House passage without amendments is a strategic calculation to lock in digital asset policy before potential complications arise from extended congressional negotiations or bundling with more contentious crypto legislation. The president’s allies view rapid approval as essential to maintaining momentum for his administration’s broader digital asset agenda, which includes establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves and positioning America as the global blockchain development hub. The GENIUS Act represents Congress’s first major attempt to regulate the rapidly expanding stablecoin market, which has grown from under $10 billion to $239 billion in just five years. The legislation would establish a federal licensing system requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain full 1:1 backing with U.S. dollars while restricting reserves to redemptions and low-risk investments such as Treasury repos. Before now, the regulatory uncertainty has contributed to a 14% decline in the U.S. share of global blockchain developers since 2018, falling to just 26% by 2023.

2025-06-19T08:30:36,"Iran imposes curfew on crypto exchanges following Nobitex hack","Iran has ordered a curfew on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges after a politically motivated attack on the country’s largest trading platform, Nobitex. According to blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis, the June 18 hack resulted in losses upwards of $90 million. The funds, which included assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, and Ton, were drained from Nobitex’s hot wallets and subsequently burned, making them permanently inaccessible. In response to the incident, the Central Bank of Iran restricted the operating hours of all local crypto exchanges, limiting them to between 10 am and 8 pm. “This operational curfew could signal increasing pressure on exchanges operating within Iran, as the regime attempts to manage systemic risk in a market that plays an outsized role in navigating around global sanctions,” the analytics firm wrote in a recent report . Pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, also known as Predatory Sparrow, has claimed responsibility and stated that the operation was intended to disrupt Iran’s sanctioned financial infrastructure. The stolen assets were sent to burner wallets without private key access, indicating a deliberate act of destruction. You might also like: Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex suffers $81M exploit, pro-Israel hacker group takes credit Chainalysis’s findings confirmed that none of the funds were sent to mixers or exchanges, and a significant portion was transferred to addresses labeled with anti-IRGC slogans. Some were sent to blockchain burn addresses, including Ethereum’s “0x…dead” wallet, while a portion of Bitcoin was directed to a provably unspendable address with an invalid checksum. Nobitex is widely considered a central pillar of Iran’s crypto economy. According to Chainalysis, it has processed over $11 billion in total inflows, more than the combined inflows of Iran’s ten next-largest crypto exchanges. It acts as the backbone for the majority of on-chain activity in the country and serves as a gateway to global markets for users cut off from traditional finance due to international sanctions. Beyond its domestic role, Chainalysis linked Nobitex to wallets associated with a range of sanctioned and illicit actors. These include ransomware operators affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, pro-Hamas media channels such as Gaza Now, and sanctioned Russian crypto exchanges including Garantex and Bitpapa. The Nobitex hack followed a series of Israeli airstrikes inside Iran, part of ongoing military and cyber tensions between the two countries. The attackers published inflammatory wallet labels and threatened to release internal source code and infrastructure data unless Nobitex users withdrew funds. In its official response, Nobitex said user assets remain secure in cold storage and that all hot wallets have been emptied. It also confirmed that its reserve fund would fully cover the losses and that it has taken steps to bolster platform security, including migrating funds to new offline wallets.

Altogether, the company has spent £27.2 million on Bitcoin so far, with an average purchase price of £78,480 ($105,430) per BTC. The acquisition follows a recently completed fundraise, announced on June 16, which was done through a mix of institutional bookbuilding and qualified investor subscriptions. The fundraising target was at least £15 million, but due to strong demand, they raised approximately £29.3 ($37.1) million — nearly double that amount. However, the capital raise resulted in a 7.39% dilution for existing shareholders, including directors, who maintained their share counts but saw slight decreases in ownership percentages.

Just a few days before the latest fundraising, on June 13, they bought 74.27 BTC for £5.98 million, bringing their total to 242.34 BTC at that point. With the latest purchase of 104.28 BTC, their Bitcoin holdings have jumped by 43% since that last buy. Other UK companies are also expanding their BTC holdings. Most notably, London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital recently acquired approximately 2,949 BTC, worth over $250 million, taking advantage of a market dip. Meanwhile, more UK firms are embracing a Bitcoin treasury strategy inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy . For example, Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd., a London-listed gold miner, recently announced plans to convert revenue from its gold operations directly into BTC, making it the first UK mining company to formally adopt a “gold-to-digital-gold” treasury approach.

2025-06-19T08:20:49,"Bitcoin ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Despite Middle East Tensions","The inflows remained strong despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. BlackRock’s IBIT led with nearly $279 million in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC also posted impressive gains. Meanwhile, Ether ETFs, led by BlackRock’s ETHA, also resumed their positive momentum. In contrast, Iran’s crypto sector suffered after a pro-Israel hacking group exploited the Nobitex exchange, which caused the central bank to restrict trading hours. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, also recently warned of a societal collapse due to France’s increasing censorship and regulatory pressure. Bitcoin ETFs Thrive in Volatile Market Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded $388.3 million in inflows on June 18. This was the eighth consecutive day of capital injections despite the geopolitical tension stemming from the Israel-Iran conflict. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) According to data from Farside Investors , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack with $278.9 million in inflows, followed by the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $104.4 million. The consistent demand means that there is still institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even after markets initially reacted nervously to Middle East developments. Crypto analytics platform Santiment pointed out that Bitcoin stayed resilient in the $104,000 to $105,000 range throughout the day. They mentioned that this behavior mirrors patterns that were seen in previous geopolitical events like the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in late 2023, where Bitcoin initially dropped but quickly stabilized. Other ETFs also showed strength, with the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recording an $11.3 million inflow, while products from ARK Invest, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree did not register any movement. The only major outflows came from Grayscale products. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) lost $16.4 million, while its lower-cost counterpart, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, shed another $10.1 million. Still, the broader trend is still positive. Since April 17, Bitcoin ETFs recorded just eight days of net outflows, and attracted $11.2 billion in inflows. In total, more than $46.3 billion has flowed into the eleven US-based Bitcoin ETFs to date, with BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC managing $50.6 billion and $11.5 billion in assets, respectively. This includes large outflows of $23.2 billion from Grayscale’s GBTC product. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs in the US are also seeing increased attention. Despite a brief pause in inflows on June 13, the funds bounced back with three straight days of inflows between June 16 and 18. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is leading the Ether ETF market as well, and it only experienced two days without inflows since May 20. Iran Limits Crypto Exchange Hours After Pro-Israel Hack While the Middle East tensions did not slow down inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it did impact the crypto space in Iran itself. Iran’s central bank imposed strict operating hours on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges after a major security breach at Nobitex, the country’s leading crypto trading platform. The new regulations restrict trading to between 10 am and 8 pm to try and improve oversight and manage potential future attacks during working hours. The decision was made after pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for an exploit that drained over $100 million from Nobitex’s hot wallets across multiple cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana. According to Chainalysis , the stolen funds were not transferred to new wallets for profit but were instead sent to burner addresses, permanently removing them from circulation. This politically motivated attack stands out in contrast to typical financially driven exploits. Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, explained that Iran may be trying to assert tighter control over citizen crypto activity, particularly during a period of rising geopolitical tension and the potential for capital flight. This is not the first time Iran’s central bank intervened in the crypto market. In December, all exchanges were temporarily shut down to prevent further devaluation of the Iranian rial. Now, in the wake of the Nobitex incident and Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian territory on June 13, authorities are once again exercising tighter control over the country’s crypto infrastructure. Nobitex confirmed the breach publicly, and announced that external access to its servers had been severed. The exchange reassured its users that its reserve fund will fully cover the losses and that affected hot wallets are being moved to cold storage. However, internet disruptions and restricted server access are likely to delay the restoration of user access. (Source: Chainalysis ) Chainalysis shed some light on Nobitex’s central role in Iran’s digital asset ecosystem, with more than $11 billion in inflows. This is much larger than the next ten Iranian exchanges combined. The platform is seen as a vital link for Iranians navigating sanctions to participate in global crypto markets. However, its operations have also been connected to groups considered terrorist organizations by Western authorities, as well as sanctioned Russian exchanges like Garantex and Bitpapa. Pavel Durov Warns of Collapse in France Tensions are mounting in other parts of the world as well. Telegram founder Pavel Durov warned that France risks facing societal collapse if it continues pursuing what he describes as a misguided path of censorship and overregulation. In an interview with French publication Le Point, Durov expressed his disappointment with President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, and stated that France is becoming “weaker and weaker” and losing its competitive edge. He explained that failing to enact necessary reforms and raising generations under restrictive ideologies could lead to extreme transformations or even collapse. This is in stark contrast with innovation-friendly environments like Dubai, which he said are attracting France’s top talent. Pavel Durov Durov’s comments are part of a broader media campaign he undertook since his arrest in France in August of 2024. That arrest drew a lot of backlash from the crypto industry and global civil rights advocates, who saw it as a threat to free speech and digital sovereignty. While the legal case is still under international scrutiny, Durov speaks out against what he sees as creeping authoritarianism under the guise of regulatory reform. (Source: X ) In the interview, Durov also made serious allegations against France’s intelligence services by claiming that their chief, Nicolas Lerner, approached him at the Hôtel de Crillon and requested the censorship of pro-conservative content ahead of Romania’s May 2025 presidential election. Durov said he refused the request as it contradicted the principles of open discourse. He also criticized the European Union’s Digital Services Act, and described it as a deceptive legislative framework that could enable widespread censorship under the pretext of consumer protection and misinformation control. Durov warned that such laws are inherently dangerous, as they could eventually be turned against those who helped enact them.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9620/bitcoin-et-fs-extend-inflow-streak-despite-middle-east-tensions,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T08:16:14,"Bitcoin Ecosystem Poised for Major Growth as Scaling Advances and Institutional Adoption Deepens","The Bitcoin ecosystem is in a crucial state of transformation, as it expands far beyond its initial primary role as a store of value. The scaling solutions now being focused upon, along with the robust DeFi structure that is taking shape on the Bitcoin network, mean that attention is shifting quite rapidly from the paradigm of Bitcoin as a mostly static, low-throughput asset to that of a far more dynamic and fully usable Bitcoin network. Even at a low level of infrastructural development, the promise of a rigorous stack of DeFi primitives emerging on the Bitcoin network is pushing the price of Bitcoin upward—and for the first time, really, signaling to the architecture community that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is ripe for serious redevelopment and renovation. Bitcoin Ecosystem The Bitcoin ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with a strong focus on scaling solutions. Once the #Bitcoin scaling challenge is addressed, a flourishing DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin seems almost inevitable. This is especially true given Bitcoin’s dramatically… pic.twitter.com/zvac3yQCMH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 18, 2025 Even with the spectacular rally of Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark, vital signs indicate that the market is not yet in the speculative bubble mode of prior peak periods. This creates the perhaps unprecedented situation of Bitcoin being up over 1,000% in the past year, yet being looked at as a relatively stable investment. In any case, it is virtually unthinkable that the current Bitcoin price level is anywhere near the ceiling. Scaling Unlocks the Path to Bitcoin DeFi The perennial problem of scalability on Bitcoin has been a serious bottleneck for greater utility and application development. Yet, a few recent developments in Layer 2 solutions—like the Lightning Network and other off-chain transaction frameworks—are finally starting to show some real promise. These innovations have allowed the network to achieve something that’s relatively rare in the world of Bitcoin: faster and cheaper transactions. And that, in turn, is enabling something that’s even rarer in the world of DeFi: a native ecosystem. DeFi has been built on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. But building DeFi on Bitcoin has not yet been realized. With its serious security and phenomenal name recognition, Bitcoin could very well become the backbone of a future decentralized financial system—if the protocols keep improving in usability and scaling. This evolution is happening when institutional investors and state-level actors are taking part in Bitcoin like never before. Government-backed initiatives, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds have been putting real capital into Bitcoin, and the above-mentioned developments are only adding more and seemingly inexorable momentum to the Bitcoin ecosystem’s evolution and maturation. Market Still in Cooling Zone Despite All-Time Highs While Bitcoin trades easily above $100,000, its present MVRV ratio—a key valuation metric comparing market value to realized value—lingers at a modest 2.25. This is reminiscent of the way things were in the lead-up to the 2023 Bitcoin Halving, in that the MVRV was somewhat low relative to the price action (like way back in 2021). And yet, we must also say that the 2.25 figure has not typically been associated with major market tops. The last time the MVRV ratio had a similar reading (in the bull run leading to the 2021 Bitcoin top) was when prices were under $40,000. Although Bitcoin is now trading comfortably above $100k, its MVRV ratio is only 2.25; still far below previous cycle peaks, even after factoring in the indicator’s long-term downward drift. This indicates the market still isn't as overheated as it was during earlier peaks pic.twitter.com/4TX39NLU3s — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) June 17, 2025 Also, this relatively tame MVRV ratio occurs despite the indicator’s long-term trending downward. This drift suggests a market that is long overdue for an awesome, almost cavalier, sense of achievement (a.k.a. a market in BTC that is increasingly mature and efficient). The current MVRV reading entertains the rising BTC price not yet in a zone of dangerous overexuberance. This is being interpreted by investors, traders, and analysts as a sign that the current cycle may have more room to run. If inflation and the debasement of fiat currencies continue to drive demand for hard, decentralized assets, we might be in for quite a run. Whale Movements Signal Strategic Adjustments The overall market is fairly stable, but the recent activity of a few important traders shows the overall market is more than what’s on the surface. One of these traders, the “Mysterious Whale”—under the handle @AguilaTrades—recently made some news by not just rebalancing but by really cutting back on a huge leveraged position. Aguila started with a position that was 20 times as large as Bitcoin’s price when he bet on the cryptocurrency in October 2021. The trader initially opened a 20x long position valued at $424 million, representing a bold bet on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. However, after recent developments in the market and price actions, he has now closed the majority of that position and reduced his holdings to just 736.5 BTC, a far cry from the original 3,952.66 BTC he controlled. The value of the remaining position, at current prices, is approximately $77 million. Exiting after a previous trade that resulted in a loss of $12.5 million, Aguila has now realized total losses of over $15 million. This retreat makes clear that even with Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs, high-leverage players are exercising a lot more caution these days. While the move may well reflect risk management on the part of Aguila, it also underscores how short-term, high-volatility trading is a bit of a crapshoot right now. Even with these adjustments being made, they don’t seem to have affected investors’ overall enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency space. “On-chain data and macro signals continue to impressed, support a longer-term bullish narrative, especially as the Bitcoin ecosystem extends its reach toward not just being a store of simple value, but also toward building a complex financial infrastructure in addition to that simple value storage.” – Wall Street Journal As the ecosystem keeps maturing, a completely realized Bitcoin-native DeFi landscape is no longer a hypothetical—it’s an emerging reality with deep institutional roots and global potential.

Despite strong ETF inflows and positive signs from the market, the price isn’t breaking out. So what’s holding it back? Recent reports reveal that both short-term traders and long-term holders are quietly selling. Even Bitcoin miners are adding to the pressure. Let’s take a deeper look into what’s really going on behind the scenes. Short-Term Holders Taking Profits Over the last few weeks, Bitcoin has faced heavy selling pressure from different types of holders. According to Glassnode, wallets that held Bitcoin for less than a year accounted for 83% of realized profits recently. Just six to twelve-month holders alone sold over $904 million worth of BTC, one of the highest selling amounts this year. Last week, we highlighted how $BTC wallets that held >12m were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. Yesterday: 6–12m holders alone realized $904M – second-highest daily profit YTD pic.twitter.com/gBD8tLCjVG — glassnode (@glassnode) June 17, 2025 But it’s not just the short-term crowd. Even long-term holders who’ve kept their BTC for over a year are cashing out. In early June, they realized a massive $1.2 billion in profits. While that number has dropped, it still shows how veteran investors are using this range to take money off the table. Miners Add to Selling Pressure Another group adding pressure is the miners.Recent data shows they’ve sold 30,000 BTC in just 20 days, lowering their total holdings from 1.94 million to 1.91 million BTC. While this isn’t huge compared to the total market volume, it adds to the overall pressure keeping Bitcoin from breaking higher Investors Searching For Other Option At the same time, some institutional investors are shifting their focus. Delta-neutral strategies, which involve locking in gains without price risk, are giving returns of 15–30% APY. That’s attractive compared to holding Bitcoin, which has already seen huge gains from $75K to $100K in under two months. With fewer explosive gains expected from Bitcoin now that it’s over $100K, some funds are diversifying into gold, stocks, or private assets. Low Funding Rates Signal Healthy Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. According to on-chain analytics from Santiment , this price stability is accompanied by notably low funding rates, which is an encouraging sign for the market’s overall health. Funding rates are a key indicator in the crypto derivatives market. When these rates are low, it means there isn’t a surge of traders using leverage to bet on Bitcoin’s price moves. Bitcoin: Key Level To Watch Out As of now, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. Bitcoin’s next big breakout likely depends on U.S. stocks moving higher or broader liquidity returning to markets. The key levels to watch are $102,000 and $106,000.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-stuck-above-100k-whos-selling-and-slowing-the-next-big-rally/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T08:10:05,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 57: Crucial Shift into Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 57: Crucial Shift into Greed Zone Curious about the mood of the digital asset space? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular barometer for gauging the prevailing emotion in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, this index has shown a significant uptick, signaling a notable shift in crypto market sentiment . Let’s dive into what this move means and how this fascinating tool works. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aggregates various market data points to produce a single number between 0 and 100. This number aims to represent the current emotional state of the market participants. A score closer to 0 signifies extreme fear, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarian investors, while a score near 100 indicates extreme greed, which some view as a signal for a potential market correction. As of June 19, the index registered a value of 57, a five-point increase from the previous day. This upward movement pushed the index out of the ‘Neutral’ territory and firmly into the ‘Greed’ zone. This shift suggests that market participants are becoming more optimistic and confident, potentially driven by recent price movements or positive news flow. Here’s a simple breakdown of the index zones: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-59: Neutral 60-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed What Factors Influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index isn’t based on a single metric but is a composite of six key factors, each weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values. High volatility, especially downwards, can increase fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans Twitter for specific posts related to Bitcoin and analyzes their sentiment and engagement rates. A high volume of positive, engaged tweets suggests greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused by Alternative) This factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear of altcoins and a flight to the perceived safety of Bitcoin, while decreasing dominance might signal increasing greed for potentially higher altcoin gains. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Search data for search queries related to Bitcoin. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “how to buy Bitcoin” can indicate growing public interest and potentially greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does it Mean for Trading Psychology? The index moving into the ‘Greed’ zone is often interpreted as a sign that the market is heating up. Investors are becoming more confident, perhaps even euphoric. This increased confidence can lead to more aggressive buying, potentially driving prices higher in the short term. However, it’s crucial to understand the implications for trading psychology . Historically, periods of extreme greed have sometimes preceded market pullbacks or corrections. When greed is high, investors might overlook risks, chase hype, and make impulsive decisions based on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can create a bubble-like environment that is vulnerable to sudden reversals. Therefore, while ‘Greed’ indicates positive momentum, it also serves as a yellow flag, reminding participants to exercise caution and avoid getting swept up in the euphoria. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ are often associated with market bottoms, as panic selling drives prices down, potentially creating opportunities for those brave enough to buy against the prevailing sentiment. The index essentially quantifies these collective emotional states, offering a counter-perspective to purely fundamental or technical analysis. Using the Index: Actionable Insights and Crypto Volatility How can investors and traders use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s best viewed as a supplementary tool, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use the index as a contrarian signal. Extreme fear might suggest a potential buying opportunity (when others are panicking), while extreme greed might suggest a potential selling opportunity (when the market is overheated). Sentiment Confirmation: It can help confirm or question your own read on the market. If you feel the market is fearful but the index is high, it prompts further investigation. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score can be a reminder to tighten stop losses, reduce leverage, or take some profits, acknowledging the increased risk of a downturn fueled by high crypto volatility . Understanding Market Phases: The index helps visualize the cyclical nature of market emotions, from panic and capitulation (fear) to optimism and euphoria (greed). It’s important to remember that the crypto market, known for its high crypto volatility , can change sentiment rapidly. The index provides a snapshot, but market conditions are constantly evolving. Limitations and Considerations While valuable, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not without limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects sentiment, which correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t directly *cause* them. External news, regulations, or technological developments are primary drivers. Bitcoin-Centric: While it considers Bitcoin dominance, the underlying factors (volatility, volume, social media, Google Trends) are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts specific to altcoins. Historical Data: The effectiveness of using the index as a contrarian tool is based on historical patterns, which may not always repeat. Factor Weighting: The specific weightings assigned to each factor are determined by Alternative and might be debated. Therefore, always use the index in conjunction with other forms of analysis, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Market Psychology The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into the ‘Greed’ zone marks a significant moment for crypto market sentiment . It reflects increasing optimism among participants, driven by a combination of factors like market momentum, volume, and social buzz. While this indicates positive short-term energy, it also highlights the importance of understanding trading psychology and the inherent crypto volatility . The index serves as a powerful reminder that emotions play a huge role in financial markets. By tracking fear and greed, it offers investors a unique perspective – a pulse check on the collective mindset. As the market continues to navigate its path, keeping an eye on this index, while employing sound risk management strategies and diverse analysis methods, remains a prudent approach for anyone involved in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Could this be where the bleed ends? Solana Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $145 & $147 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Solana based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up? The Cost Basis Distribution tells us about how much of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was last purchased or transferred at what spot price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the data of the indicator for Solana over the past few months. As is visible, there are a few price zones near the current Solana spot price that stand out in terms of the amount of supply that they hold. The $155 to $157 range carries the cost basis of around 31 million tokens and the $164 to $166 range that of 29 million tokens. A third demand zone exists at $145 to $147, a region that the cryptocurrency’s price is currently making a retest of. Here, the investors last purchased a total of 13 million SOL. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so they are more likely to show some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. Generally, this type of reaction isn’t anything relevant for the asset when just a few holders share their acquisition mark at the level, but when a large amount of them are involved, like in the case of the range that SOL is retesting right now, a sizeable reaction can sometimes appear. Generally, these moves tend toward buying when the retest occurs from above. That is, when the investors were in the green prior to the retest. This happens because these holders might believe the price decline to be just a dip opportunity or they may simply want to protect their cost basis. Similarly, holders might panic sell when the retest happens from below. This could happen because underwater sellers can be desperate to get back into the green and once they do, they might fear that the rise is only temporary so they could push for the exit. As Solana is retesting the $145 to $147 range from above, it’s possible that buyers from this region could provide support to the asset and help cushion its fall. In the event that a turnaround does happen, the $155 to $157 resistance range could be of focus next. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? The analytics firm has also shared the CBD of another altcoin, Tron (TRX).

Meanwhile, 1INCH appears ready for potential reversals after weeks of prolonged consolidations and significant downtrends. The alt recently rebounded from the reliable support at $0.1777, hinting at upside price actions. With the underway voting looking to compensate victims of last year’s hack, could 1INCH extend its recovery to the key hurdle at $0.2274? Fundamentals and technical indicators suggest so. DAO proposal to compensate exploited victims 1inch Foundation’s new proposal , dubbed 1IP-80, fuels the prevailing optimism on the digital asset. It seeks to pay individuals who suffered from the October 2024 supply chain exploit. The incident happened after perpetrators leveraged weakness in the website plugin Lottie Player library, stealing tokens worth $768,026. While the protocol recovered most assets from the latest attack (which happened in March 2025), it hasn’t recompensed October victims. Thus, the new proposal seeks to pay affected investors using DAO treasury funds. Compensating exploit victims might renew confidence in the project as it reveals its user-centric approach. The proposal reads: A comprehensive reimbursement maintains user trust, demonstrates ecosystem resilience, and aligns with the DAO’s commitment to community protection. The proposal’s controversy and KYC requirements The proposal has attracted controversies among the DAO community. One side believes compensating users using DAO funds without continued revenue inflows would drain the treasury, weakening 1inch. They trust the project doesn’t boast financial muscles to offer insurance services. However, some argue that the DAO should protect its users. The ongoing voting testifies to the split, with 53.47% (3.8 million) in favor and 46.53% (3.3 million) against. Source: 1inch Network However, only two large addresses dominate the voting, one accounting for all No and the other YES votes. Voting will conclude on 22 June. Meanwhile, the reimbursement plan requires various actions from users (if the proposal passes). First and foremost, they should verify their identities by completing KYC procedures. Also, victims should prove the loss with evidence and file a law enforcement statement. Moreover, they should sign a reimbursement agreement and surrender future rights to any retrieved assets. Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into 1inch’s exploitations is ongoing in the Cayman Islands 1NCH price outlook: an 18% rally imminent? The native token has struggled with notable bearishness lately, depicting deteriorated user confidence, possibly due to hacking incidents. Crypto enthusiasts avoid protocols with weak security infrastructures. 1INCH trades at $0.1916 after dropping 15% and 12% in the past month and week. Nevertheless, price charts bring some hope. 1inch forms a potential reversal pattern on the 4H chart after extended declines. The altcoin has bounced back from the reliable support barrier at $0.1777. 1NCH has tested this zone several times, highlighting buyer interest around the mark. Recently, prices plunged to $0.1744 but rebounded to the support swiftly, creating a potential double-bottom setup, which heralds substantial price rallies. 1inch bulls will target the resistance at $0.2208. That could clear the path to $0.2274, which would mean an 18.69% jump from 1NCH’s current price. The MACD and RSI demonstrate the gradual buyer resurgence. Source: TradingView However, 1inch trades below the 50EMA, indicating seller control. Price dips below $0.1900 could plunge the token to the $0.1777 foothold. Losing $0.1744 will invalidate the bullish narrative and catalyze notable dips or consolidations.

2025-06-19T07:37:12,"Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure","The post Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As web3 scales across new chains, verticals, and user experiences, one foundational layer has remained frustratingly stagnant: oracles. While computation and storage have seen real breakthroughs, oracle infrastructure still relies heavily on permissioned setups, opaque pricing, and manual onboarding. The result is a bottleneck that slows innovation and burdens newer chains with long lead times and steep costs. Blocksense , a zero-knowledge-native oracle protocol launched in 2024, set out to change that. One year after raising a $4 million pre-seed round, the team has evolved from early-stage concept to active deployments across more than two dozen ecosystems. Live feeds now serve builders on Aztec, Citrea, Pharos, Aurora, TAC, Plume, BIMA, and Manta Network, with the protocol preparing to join EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS), and its SDK entering public release. From Seed Round to Ecosystem Integration In mid-2024, Blocksense raised funding to build oracle infrastructure from scratch. Programmable, verifiable, and open by design. That vision has materialized into a protocol with measurable traction. It uses a ZK rollup-inspired architecture that allows feed updates to be batched and verified through zero-knowledge proofs. This drastically reduces on-chain cost while maintaining full integrity. Consensus is secured using zkSchellingPoint , where reporters vote in secret and are only rewarded if their submissions match the final majority. These aren’t theoretical claims. Blocksense’s system is already live in testnet environments, with pull-model feeds supporting DeFi protocols, prediction markets, real-world attestations, and emerging use cases in AI inference. Oracle-as-Code: Programmability Comes to Data Feeds What truly distinguishes Blocksense from earlier oracle models is its programmability . Legacy oracles operate as walled gardens. Developers often need approvals just to get a new feed listed — a process that can take weeks and limit experimentation. Blocksense flips that model. With its SDK, developers can define oracle logic in a WebAssembly-compatible format, specifying exactly what data to fetch, how to process it, and under what conditions to publish it. Once deployed, these scripts can be executed by node operators and verified on-chain — without any centralized bottlenecks. This shift from “oracle-as-a-service” to “oracle-as-code” unlocks a wide range of new use cases: Pharos uses programmable feeds to resolve prediction markets based on game-theoretic input. TAC triggers smart account actions only when multi-agent intent conditions are met. Citrea leverages custom scripts to publish Bitcoin L2 state views to Ethereum. BIMA verifies off-chain deliberation outcomes from human and AI collectives. Plume relies on oracle scripts to validate real-world asset metadata from partner registries. Manta Network experiments with feeds that verify compliance proofs for zk-based DeFi access. The core design: developers write the logic, node operators execute it, and a zero-knowledge circuit verifies that the votes and aggregation were processed correctly — including cryptographic signature validation and consensus logic. The result is a verifiable, permissionless, and expressive oracle layer designed for modular web3. Scaling Securely Without Sacrificing Trustlessness Blocksense avoids centralized coordination through a blend of cryptography and incentives. Reporters are selected privately and vote without visibility into the network’s state. A structure that discourages collusion and bribery. The system then uses a ZK circuit to prove that only valid votes were counted and that results matched the majority. To support this, the team has grown to 30+ across protocol engineering, cryptography, and developer support. While initial operations are backed by a trusted node set, decentralization is evolving — with open script publishing already live and full operator participation on the roadmap. The upcoming EigenLayer integration will deepen security by allowing Ethereum-aligned stakers to secure Blocksense as an AVS, aligning incentives across protocols, operators, and feed authors. What’s Next for Oracle Infrastructure? Blocksense envisions oracles not just as data feeds, but as middleware for intersubjective truth . The kind needed to verify AI outputs, trigger intent-based contracts, or synchronize decisions across modular systems. For Q2 and beyond, the team is focused on: Finalizing the public SDK for permissionless script creation Expanding support for non-price data formats and AI-related feeds Automating deployment pipelines for new rollups and alt-VMs Scaling incentives for reporters via MEV/OEV participation and AVS yield alignment With its 30+ network integrations, Blocksense is already powering applications that would be impossible to serve through legacy oracle frameworks. Conclusion In 2024, Blocksense raised capital to challenge how oracle data is produced, verified, and consumed. One year later, it has turned that capital into live infrastructure — tested, adopted, and used by real-world developers. Where many protocols celebrate fundraising as a milestone, Blocksense sees it as a starting point. What matters more is the shift it represents: away from permissioned data, toward a world where any developer can define how truth is derived on-chain. For builders seeking autonomy over their data layer, that shift is already underway.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/blocksense-moves-beyond-oracle-bottleneck-with-verifiable-permissionless-infrastructure/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZK","Information",cryptocompare

The total valuation of the industry has dipped slightly to $3.26 trillion. Trading volumes, too, have taken a hit, down by 9% indicating cautious moves by market participants. Talking about blue chip coins, Bitcoin is changing hands at $104,991.34, while Ethereum trades at $2524.22. XRP is slightly down at $2.16, holding on to gains from earlier in the week. The business appears to be in a consolidation phase, with volumes reducing and price ranges tightening. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price continues to hover around the $105k mark, showing resilience despite geopolitical instability. On the charts, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a potential breakout, although the direction remains uncertain. It is worth noting that the support lies at $103,600, and a break below this could drag BTC toward the psychological $100k mark. Contrarily, the bulls must reclaim their foothold at $105,500 and aim for a breakout toward $108,000, where significant resistance awaits. However, with intraday volume at $48.42 billion, down nearly 9%, any upside may be capped unless fresh momentum arrives. Curious about BTC’s long-term growth?

However, whale wallets have been actively accumulating, which is a healthy sign for a possible breakout. Traders should take note that the 24H low of $2469.05 serves as immediate support. If ETH price holds above $2,500, a short-term rally to $2,600 is possible. Conversely, falling below $2,460 could take ETH back toward the $2,400 demand zone. That being said, the drop in 24H volume by 17.65% may reflect weakening conviction among retail traders. Interested in stacking some Ether?

2025-06-19T07:22:17,"Analysis: Bitcoin’s dormant supply growth outpaces new issuance for the first time in history","For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the amount of BTC held dormant for a decade or more is now growing faster than the network is producing new coins. This shift, which began shortly after the April 2024 halving, marks a critical turning point in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply dynamics, according to a June 18 report by Fidelity Digital Assets. As of June 8, an average of 566 BTC per day is crossing into the “ancient supply” category, meaning the coins have not moved in 10 years or more. That figure now exceeds the network’s post-halving daily issuance rate of 450 BTC. Fidelity’s analysis stresses how the growing influence of long-term holders is redefining Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative in real-time. Dormant coins are often interpreted as a sign of conviction, or in some cases, permanent loss due to inaccessible private keys. Regardless of motive, the numbers are significant. Over 3.4 million BTC, more than 17% of the total supply, have not moved in at least a decade. That figure includes coins mined in Bitcoin’s early years, with Satoshi Nakamoto considered the first 10-year holder as of January 2019. You might also like: Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable This trend is more than symbolic. Fidelity notes that fewer than 3% of days since 2019 have seen a decline in ancient supply, while the portion of coins held for five years or more is also decreasing far less often than it rises. At the same time, public companies are increasingly contributing to this long-term cohort. As of June 8, 27 listed firms held more than 800,000 BTC combined. Projections suggest ancient supply could account for 30% of all Bitcoin in circulation by 2035 if this pattern holds. Still, high conviction isn’t absolute. Since the 2024 U.S. election, the report notes that ancient supply has fallen day-to-day 10% of the time, about four times the historical average. For holders of five years or more, that volatility is even higher, with 39% of days showing net outflows. These movements partly explain the choppy price action in early 2025 and serve as a reminder that even long-term holders can be shaken in uncertain markets. Fidelity emphasizes that scarcity is not the only factor influencing price. However, when issuance is decreasing and long-term supply is tightening, there is a greater chance of upward price pressure, especially if institutional and new ETF product demand picks up speed.

2025-06-19T07:10:28,"BTC mining difficulty drops slightly — could MUTM be the quiet beneficiary?","The Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty has recently dipped after it hit a new all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, 2025. Since then, the mining difficulty has dipped to around 126.4 trillion. A higher mining difficulty and the network hashrate are separate but related measures of the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol. A rising difficulty indicates rising competition and higher costs for miners. This rising difficulty has increased pressures on miners, especially following the reduction of block rewards after the April 2024 halving. This has seen small miners pushed to the edges as it has become harder to remain profitable. Amid the rising competition, some publicly traded companies like MARA are doubling down and growing their capacity; meanwhile, small miners are having to join mining pools. This new dynamic in the BTC mining sector has also seen some miners look for opportunities for profitability elsewhere. A major point of focus is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which is currently in phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a new source of growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the DeFi industry that aims to usher in a new era for DeFi lending. The project utilizes a unique protocol design and an overarching framework that ensures the long-term viability of the protocol. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can join as lenders or borrowers. Lenders deposit their assets in the pools and earn interest in return. The interest rate that they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises. This rising rate encourages borrowers to repay their loans while attracting more lenders looking for bigger yields. As liquidity flows into the pool, the utilization rate drops. The result is a positive feedback loop that ensures liquidity growth and optimal capital efficiency. To project liquidity in the pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has implemented various measures. One of these measures is the use of deposit and borrow caps. The deposit caps define the maximum amount of a given asset that can be supplied to the protocol. Such a cap ensures that the protocol does not have too much exposure to a potentially destabilizing asset. Additionally, it helps to deal with the exploit of infinite asset minting. The deposit cap is usually set by evaluating the on-chain activity, the price stability, and the historical asset performance. When it comes to borrowing caps, it represents the maximum amount of an asset that can be borrowed from the protocol. The cap is used for tokens that show signs of possible price manipulation or signs of problems with their liquidity. By capping their borrowing volume, Mutuum Finance mitigates the potential impact of the token on the solvency of the ecosystem due to price fluctuations. In some cases, Mutuum Finance may place assets in the restricted mode. That means that an asset can only be used for borrowing an asset of the same type. The restricted mode is imposed when the oracle data shows signs of being prone to manipulation. That ensures that the protocol does not expose the system-wide danger of default if a token experiences sudden artificial price movement. Mutuum Finance can also use the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) mode for assets that show signs of positive price correlation. When an asset is granted the ECE mode, it can access elevated borrowing limits. That ensures better capital efficiency for participants in such a pool, while limiting any systemic fallout to the ecosystem. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase. Tokens in phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. So far, over $10.75 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,200 unique buyers. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price is set to go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That increase will cut the expected ROI based on the planned listing price of 40.06 from 100% to 71.43%. Seeking to avoid that cut, the phase presale has experienced a blazing speed of participation, with around 40% of the tokens set aside for the phase already sold, barely two weeks after it started. Another major driver of the current pace of the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to give ten lucky participants in the presale $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for the giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting DeFi project that is forecast to offer returns of 20x or more when it goes live. The ongoing presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.03, presents the perfect opportunity to position your crypto portfolio for massive gains.

Goldman Sachs says in a note to investors that the “Prominent 10” companies in China may be the country’s answer to the “Magnificent 7” companies in the US, reports Investopedia. Says Goldman Sachs’ analysts, “[The ten companies] embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global,’ services and new forms of consumption and China’s improving shareholder returns.” The bank’s analysts say that a favorable regulatory environment and artificial intelligence investments may boost the earnings of the ten public-owned enterprises (POEs) by 13% in each of the next two years. The companies include the gaming and multimedia giant Tencent, e-commerce firm Alibaba, smartphone maker Xiaomi, EV maker BYD, shopping platform Meituan, online gaming firm NetEase, home appliance maker Midea, pharmaceutical company Hengrui, online travel agency Trip.com and sports equipment company ANTA. The Magnificent Seven companies include Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Goldman Sachs’ bullish outlook also factors in the Chinese equity market’s relative segmentation and modest valuations. Another consideration by the bank’s analysts is the Chinese government’s recent move to increase support for the private economy, as well as updated regulations to make mergers and acquisitions easier. Say the bank’s analysts, “All these should help revitalize POEs’ investment appetite (animal spirits), thereby supporting their organic and acquisitive growth down the road.” Source: Kris/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Traders are closely watching for confirmation of either a bullish reversal or further downside as key momentum indicators remain mixed. Here’s a detailed look at the Bitcoin price today, current momentum, and what to expect next. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Bitcoin price is trading at $104,980 at the time of writing, reflecting a minor decline of 0.14% over the last 24 hours. Following a sharp rejection from the $108,000–$109,000 zone, BTC is consolidating above the $104,300–$103,700 support band. Buyers are attempting to defend this range amid increasingly tight price action forming within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This contraction phase, paired with declining ATR (average true range), suggests Bitcoin price volatility is compressing ahead of a breakout. The question now is Why is Bitcoin price going down today despite supportive technical structures? The answer lies in conflicting momentum signals and weakening trend strength indicators.

2025-06-19T07:00:57,"Asia’s 1st Public Crypto Firm, MemeStrategy, Scores Historic SOL Win","MemeStrategy, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange–listed firm, made waves this week by snapping up 2,440 units of Solana (SOL). Based in Hong Kong and backed by the team behind 9GAG, the company spent about HKD 2.9 million ($370,000) on June 16, 2025. According to a Monday announcement , each SOL token cost an average of HKD 1,191, and the purchase went through OSL Group. Gateway To Web3 Infrastructure Based on reports , MemeStrategy wants more than a quick trade. It plans to tap into Solana’s growing pool of developers and institutional users. By owning SOL, the firm hopes to claim a spot in what it calls “critical Web3 infrastructure.” 引用元： https://t.co/eADYJ4g8r8 — Superteam Japan (@SuperteamJapan) June 17, 2025 The team says this aligns with its three pillars—artificial intelligence, blockchain, and culture—and that hands‑on involvement could help it find new ways to bridge apps with real‑world finance. Staking For Steady Returns According to the company, running its own validator nodes on Solana’s proof‑of‑stake network will bring consistent rewards. That means MemeStrategy can earn more SOL over time simply by keeping its coins locked in the network. At the same time, it pitches in to secure the blockchain. Company executives point out that staking fits their goal of steady income streams alongside spot holdings. Share Price Takes Off Investors cheered the move. Shares shot up 28% to HKD 2.57 on Monday after the Solana buy was revealed. Some traders saw it as a sign that MemeStrategy is ready to roll up its sleeves in crypto, not just hold tokens. Others warned that SOL can swing wildly, so a price drop could hit both the token stake and the firm’s stock. Either way, that 28% climb shows how hungry the market is for big names backing smart‑contract platforms. Joining A Growing Club MemeStrategy isn’t alone. DeFi Development Corporation, Upexi Inc., Sol Strategies and Classover have all added SOL to their treasuries. What stands out is that this is the first such move by a Hong Kong–listed outfit.

BlackRock bought $36.7M in ETH, showing growing institutional trust. Ethereum wallets are accumulating heavily, similar to previous market peaks. After what many traders are calling a long “bear winter,” there are early signs that the crypto market could be warming up. Despite record-low social media engagement and widespread frustration over months of sideways price action, data points to a budding recovery, led by Ethereum’s surprising strength. The “Ethereum Cycle” Emerges Inside this gloom, a report by Willy Woo has identified a key turning point: the market is entering an “Ethereum cycle.” Historically, when Ethereum begins to outperform Bitcoin, it signals that wider altcoin strength is building.

2025-06-19T06:41:07,"What’s Next for Bitcoin? Here’s What You Need to Know","Cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision has shared a remarkable analysis of Bitcoin’s technical outlook in its latest assessment. The company states that Bitcoin is now approaching a critical decision moment after weeks of sideways movement. According to MakroVision, Bitcoin is moving in a narrowing triangle formation between $102,000 and $110,000. This structure shows that there is indecision between the bulls and bears in the market. Bitcoin, which has lost momentum after the last peak of $112,000, is looking for direction. In the short term, the most critical support level stands out as $102,000. If this level is broken, the $98,600–97,700 band (0.382 Fibonacci retracement level) may come into play. For an upward move, the $109,500 level needs to be broken permanently. If this happens, upward momentum could be regained.

2025-06-19T06:39:07,"Not Enough Bitcoin: What Does The Skyrocketing Ancient BTC Supply Tell Us?","An average of 566 BTC per day is falling into this long-term “ancient supply” bucket, compared to the current daily issuance rate of 450 BTC, reported Fidelity Digital Assets on June 18. This trend marks the first time in Bitcoin’s history that long-term held coins are growing faster than new supply, potentially reinforcing the asset’s scarcity narrative. It also noted that the share of ancient supply tends to increase each day, with daily decreases observed less than 3% of the time. “The strong conviction of these ultra-long-term holders is having an increasing influence on the wider Bitcoin ecosystem,” said Fidelity research analyst Zack Wainwright. As of June 8, 17% of all bitcoin falls into the category of “ancient supply”—meaning these coins have not moved in a decade or more. What could this mean for scarcity, market dynamics, and investors’ conviction? Find our team’s thoughts: https://t.co/EALzrfS92c pic.twitter.com/Ckm3MylTLY — Fidelity Digital Assets (@DigitalAssets) June 18, 2025 Bitcoin’s Ancient Supply Growing The ancient supply currently exceeds 3.4 million BTC, which is around 17% of the total supply, and it continues to grow daily in a dynamic that shifted after the 2024 halving . Additionally, Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins account for around a third of the ancient supply, but a portion is likely lost. However, since the 2024 US election, ancient supply has declined more frequently, suggesting some long-term holders are moving coins or taking profit in response to market uncertainty. The research also noted that as of June 8, the supply of five-year holders has decreased on a day-to-day basis 39% of the time following the election, three times more than the typical rate of 13%. “This long-term holder movement may help explain some of the sideways and downward price action observed during the first quarter of 2025,” Wainwright observed. “It also shows that ancient supply outpacing incoming supply on average does not necessarily lead to higher prices and can have an inverse effect in shorter timeframes as supply movements increase.” Bitcoin has only gained around 12% so far this year, which is supposed to be the peak of the bull market cycle , if history repeats. A Unique Attribute The researcher concluded that it is possible that the ancient supply increases and long-term holding behavior “may become more common in the future as new digital asset-focused investment products emerge and institutional adoption increases.” “This is one of the most unique attributes of Bitcoin that no other existing investment or commodity currently possesses—and one that could become increasingly important if demand rises as ancient supply grows.” Meanwhile, Glassnode reported that profit-taking behavior among different cohorts had flipped.

On January 16 , XRP touched an all-time high of $3.39 . Since then, the price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle , and experts believe a breakout is imminent . Now, the spotlight is back on XRP as Grayscale has filed to convert its XRP Trust into a publicly traded ETF —a move that could change everything for the XRP market. Grayscale Files for XRP ETF, SEC Acknowledges Application Grayscale is pushing to transform its XRP Trust into an ETF , and it has officially applied to the SEC . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has now acknowledged the filing , triggering a 240-day countdown for approval or rejection. BREAKING: A new $XRP ETF could be on the way. The SEC just acknowledged a proposal by Grayscale. And if approved, it could shake the crypto world. Here’s what’s happening — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) June 18, 2025 Why an XRP ETF Could Be a Game-Changer With a market cap of $128 billion and 24-hour volume of $2.6 billion , XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum (excluding stablecoins). If the XRP ETF gets approved: Traditional investors could enter the XRP market. It would boost liquidity and trading volumes . It could solidify XRP’s status alongside BTC and ETH —both of which already have ETFs. Ripple vs SEC Legal Settlement Strengthens the Case Ripple and the SEC are moving toward a final settlement. They’ve filed a joint motion to release $125 million in escrow , with $75M returning to Ripple and $50M going to the SEC . This step signals the end of a years-long legal battle , improving XRP’s position for ETF approval.

2025-06-19T06:32:56,"UK Wants Banks to Have Less Exposure to Crypto by Next Year – Here’s Why","The Bank of England (BOE) is considering a proposal that would restrict UK banks’ exposure to crypto by 2026. Speaking at the Risk Live Europe event in London on Wednesday, the central bank executive director, David Bailey, noted that the UK’s upcoming rules would be more on the “restrictive end.” He specified that banks would be encouraged to keep a low crypto exposure. “There are also examples where it might be more appropriate to start more towards the restrictive end of the spectrum,” he said. “The prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets, and specifically those with features associated with heightened price volatility and where investors could lose the entirety of their investment, is an example in this space.” UK Rules to be ‘Informed’ by Basel Committee Standards Besides, the UK is working to enact the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s disclosure framework for crypto exposure . This includes “standardized set of public tables and templates covering banks’ crypto exposures.” The Basel Committee originally indicated crypto disclosures to arrive by January 2025; however, it extended the deadline by another year. Further, the Basel Committee recommended that banks allow only 1% of their investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . FCA Set to Implement New Crypto Regime The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been pushing to establish a clear framework for cryptoasset firms in the country. The regulator’s “ gateway regime ” is earmarked for 2026, which will act as a new authorization for crypto companies. The regulator is also looking to finalize its regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto custody. The FCA is currently seeking public input on its stablecoin regulation plan. The restrictions on banks’ crypto exposure come at a time when European banks are increasingly involved in crypto. Though the EU watchdog, ESMA, noted that 95% of EU banks do not engage in crypto activities, banks like BBVA have gone ahead in advising wealthy customers to invest in crypto. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1935216936985755992 The post UK Wants Banks to Have Less Exposure to Crypto by Next Year – Here’s Why appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-wants-banks-to-have-less-exposure-to-crypto-by-next-year-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Blockchain News|FCA|UK",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T06:30:51,"Why OKB Price Prediction 2025 Signals a Bullish Year and Qubetics $18M Presale Hints at 4349% ROI","Cryptocurrency market participants closely follow key assets like OKB to gauge future trends. The OKB token, native to one of the largest global exchanges, has shown considerable resilience and steady growth potential. This article provides an in-depth look at the OKB price prediction 2025, dissecting monthly forecasts alongside an exploration of Qubetics , a promising new blockchain project that focuses on solving the critical issue of interoperability. As blockchain becomes increasingly interconnected, projects like Qubetics that enable seamless cross-chain functionality are poised to redefine the market dynamics. Alongside the technical analysis of OKB’s price trajectory, a thorough breakdown of Qubetics’ latest crypto presale data and its growth potential highlights a dual narrative of stability and innovation in crypto. What the Numbers Say: OKB Price Prediction 2025 OKB’s price outlook for 2025 shows promising stability with an optimistic growth trend. Based on extensive technical analysis, the minimum expected price for OKB in 2025 is around $46.09, while its peak could reach $51.58. The average trading price across the year is projected near $57.06, suggesting a modest yet meaningful potential return on investment. Breaking this down further, June 2025 forecasts an average price of $57.06, with a price floor of $51.11 and potential to surge slightly higher. This phase shows a potential return on investment (ROI) of approximately 20.4%. July follows closely with a similar average forecast near $54.14, a floor of $51.43, and a peak just under $57, maintaining consistent momentum. August appears to mark a subtle cooling, with analysts expecting an average OKB price around $52.09 and a tighter price range between $51.37 and $52.81. The ROI here moderates to about 11.5%, reflecting typical seasonal market fluctuations. September’s forecast continues this trend with a slightly lower floor price near $50.03 and a peak of $52.38, averaging $51.21 for the month. October expects OKB trading in the range of $49.14 to $53.57, settling at an average of $51.36. November offers a stronger outlook, with a floor price near $50.90 and peaks around $55.18, which raises the average forecast to $53.04 and an ROI climbing back to 16.5%. December closes the year with a broader price range from $46.09 to $53.60 and an average around $49.85, reflecting the typical year-end volatility and a final estimated ROI of 13.1%. Throughout 2025, OKB’s price stability, combined with moderate upward potential, indicates a crypto asset that is solidifying its market presence while offering growth aligned with broader industry trends. Why Qubetics’ Interoperability Might Change Blockchain Among emerging cryptocurrencies, Qubetics stands out for one major technical innovation: interoperability. Unlike many blockchains that operate in silos, Qubetics is architected as a Web3 aggregated chain designed to unify multiple networks, including the Bitcoin blockchain, into a single cohesive ecosystem. This interoperability means that Qubetics facilitates effortless interaction and integration between decentralized applications (DApps), tokens, and data across different chains. In practical terms, users and developers can execute cross-chain transactions, transfer assets, and share data seamlessly. This level of integration addresses a key limitation in blockchain technology today, where fragmentation impedes scalability and broad adoption. As blockchain use cases expand from finance to supply chains and beyond, interoperability will be a major driver for adoption. Qubetics’ approach represents a critical step forward in creating a unified blockchain experience that could boost future growth. Qubetics Presale: A Snapshot of Momentum Currently, Qubetics is in its final public sale phase, with fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remaining at the fixed presale price of $0.3370. This stage marks the last opportunity to acquire tokens before an anticipated listing price increase to approximately $0.40, representing an expected 20% gain at launch. The project has already raised over $18 million through the crypto presale , with more than 28,000 token holders participating. Approximately 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, indicating strong community and market interest. Notably, the tokenomics were recently adjusted to slash the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens. This reduction creates immediate scarcity and sets a foundation for potential long-term value appreciation. Qubetics Price Prediction: What Happens if $20,000 Enters Qubetics Assuming a purchase of $20,000 worth of $TICS at the current presale price of $0.3370 per token, the buyer would receive approximately 59,340 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches the expected listing value of $0.40, the portfolio value would increase to about $23,736. Should the price escalate to $1 post-presale, the same holding would be worth $59,340, yielding a 196% return on the original amount. At a $5 valuation, the portfolio’s value would climb to $296,700, translating to a remarkable 1,383% gain. Further along, at a $10 price point after the mainnet launch, the holdings would be worth nearly $593,400, marking an extraordinary 2,866% increase. Finally, if the token’s value hits $15, the portfolio value would surge to $890,100, representing an exceptional 4,349% ROI. As always, market conditions and external factors will influence real outcomes, and caution remains necessary. Conclusion: A Dual Perspective on Crypto Potential in 2025 The OKB price prediction 2025 presents a stable, promising outlook with gradual appreciation and moderate volatility. Conversely, Qubetics ’ core interoperability feature addresses one of the most critical challenges in the industry—enabling seamless cross-chain interactions. The ongoing presale and adjusted tokenomics create a unique entry with tangible scarcity and potential for rapid value appreciation. Understanding both provides a comprehensive view of what the future may hold for cryptocurrency markets.

2025-06-19T06:20:11,"AI Startups: Unlock Crucial VC Funding Secrets","BitcoinWorld AI Startups: Unlock Crucial VC Funding Secrets In the fast-paced world of technology and cryptocurrency, the spotlight often shines on disruptive innovation. Right now, that spotlight is firmly on artificial intelligence. With AI investments soaring past $110 billion in 2024, securing VC funding for AI startups is more competitive than ever. While the influx of capital presents opportunities, it also demands that early-stage companies find effective ways to stand out from the crowd. Beyond the Pitch: What Venture Capitalists Really Want Forget the glossy slides and perfect delivery. According to seasoned investors like Jill Chase of CapitalG, Kanu Gulati of Khosla Ventures, and Sara Ittelson of Accel, the real substance lies elsewhere. At Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, these venture capital experts shared insights that challenge conventional wisdom for AI founders seeking startup investment. Their consensus? Stop fixating on the ‘perfect pitch.’ While clarity is important, VCs are looking for deeper signals. Building genuine relationships and establishing trust with potential investors often matters more than rehearsing every line of a presentation. This approach helps VCs understand the team, the vision, and the underlying potential beyond the immediate market trends. Navigating the Hype Cycle and Competition for AI Startups The AI landscape is currently experiencing significant hype. For AI startups, this means navigating inflated expectations and the risk of being overshadowed or, conversely, fueling unsustainable growth. VCs are keenly aware of this cycle and look for startups with a clear strategy for long-term survival and growth, not just riding the current wave. A critical challenge discussed was competing with large incumbents. Big tech companies have resources, data, and established market positions. Startups need a compelling answer to how they will differentiate, find their niche, and gain traction without getting crushed. This often involves focusing on specific problems, leveraging unique data, or developing proprietary technology that provides a distinct advantage. Consumer Focus and Speed Drive Startup Investment Interestingly, even in the often complex world of B2B AI, a consumer-centric approach and speed remain powerful differentiators. VCs noted that companies that prioritize user experience, ease of adoption, and rapid iteration often win, regardless of whether their end customer is a business or an individual. The ability to quickly adapt to feedback and demonstrate tangible value is key to securing venture capital. Key attributes VCs seek: Strong Team: Passionate, knowledgeable founders with the ability to execute. Clear Problem/Solution: Addressing a real market need with a viable AI-powered solution. Demonstrated Traction: Early signs of product-market fit, user adoption, or revenue. Defensible Technology: Proprietary tech, data advantage, or network effects. Understanding of Market Dynamics: Awareness of competition, incumbents, and future trends. Trustworthiness: Honesty, transparency, and reliability in communication. Agents and Automation Reshaping the Playbook The rise of AI agents and automation is not just changing industries; it’s also changing how startups themselves operate. VCs are observing how these technologies can create more efficient, scalable business models. Startups leveraging automation internally or building agent-based solutions are seen as potentially having a structural advantage in the market, influencing their attractiveness for startup investment. Conclusion: Building Trust in a Competitive Landscape The path from Seed to Series C for AI startups in 2025 requires more than just a groundbreaking idea and a polished pitch deck. It demands resilience, a deep understanding of market dynamics, the ability to build trust with investors and customers, and a clear strategy for navigating hype and competition. Focusing on these core principles, as highlighted by leading venture capital firms, can significantly increase a startup’s chances of securing the necessary funding to scale and succeed in the AI era.

2025-06-19T06:17:05,"New York officials secure over $400k in crypto from Facebook ad scam","Over $440,000 in stolen crypto funds has been secured by New York officials in an ongoing fraud investigation that targeted locals. Authorities from the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Attorney General’s Office, and the New York State Department of Financial Services jointly disrupted a multi-layered cryptocurrency scam operation that had primarily targeted Russian-speaking residents in Brooklyn and across the United States. As part of the enforcement action, $140,000 in digital assets was seized, while an additional $300,000 was frozen in crypto accounts linked to the scheme. The scammers operated a malicious advertisement network across social media platforms that promoted dubious investment schemes to target unsuspecting crypto investors. The investigation into the scheme, known as “Black Hat” advertising, began in October 2024 when NYDFS detected a fake website, WhalesTrade.com, falsely displaying a BitLicense certification. The site was traced to a broader network of fraudulent platforms used to trick victims into sending cryptocurrency under the guise of high-return investment opportunities. You might also like: DOJ seeks forfeiture of $225m tied to crypto ‘pig butchering’ scams Many of the platforms used Russian-language advertisements and impersonated known personalities to gain credibility. Once victims clicked on the ads, scammers shifted communication to encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, creating the illusion of legitimate investment interactions. Initial investments were met with fabricated account statements showing inflated returns, to motivate victims to send even more money. When users attempted to withdraw their funds, they were blocked or asked to pay bogus withdrawal fees and taxes . Eventually, scammers completely cut off communication and disappear. More than 300 victims have been identified, with Brooklyn alone accounting for over $1 million in estimated losses. Officials reported that Meta, Facebook’s parent company, shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam after being alerted to the investigation. Authorities have also dismantled a network of more than 100 fraudulent domains and 17 registrar accounts used to lure unsuspecting investors. To bypass Facebook’s ad restrictions, the scammers hired “Black Hat” advertisers based in Vietnam and paid them with stolen crypto to run deceptive ads. Authorities found that the scammers converted Bitcoin into Vietnamese currency to fund the campaign, prompting a court order to freeze $300,000 in related accounts. This case is just one example in a string of scams that have weaponized digital advertising to steal from unsuspecting crypto investors. Similar tactics were seen earlier in 2024 when fake versions of platforms like Whales Market and Revoke Cash appeared as sponsored links on Google, tricking users into connecting their wallets to phishing sites. In some instances, even trusted services were impersonated with near-identical domain names, draining user funds through malicious scripts. Despite efforts by companies like Google and Meta to curb such abuse, fraudulent ads continue to surface.

2025-06-19T06:15:41,"Don’t bet on altcoin season yet — what this $36B metric says about the timing","Despite Bitcoin’s recent climb above $110,000, altcoins remain stuck in a bearish rut, raising doubts about whether the long-awaited “altcoin season” will materialize anytime soon. According to a June 18 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Burrakesmeci, one metric tells a compelling story. The 1 – Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), now sits at –$36 billion. This level that suggests investors are still pulling money from the altcoin market. The net demand from traders putting buy versus sell quotes on altcoin pairs across exchanges is reflected in this metric. It often indicates peak interest and occasionally a local top when it flips positive, as it did in December 2024. The trend has since reversed, with sustained outflows rather than inflows, as confirmed by the current reading which is in extremely negative territory. In short, altcoin investors are still sitting on the sidelines, even as Bitcoin dominates headlines. You might also like: Altcoin season is over: Here’s what can make a project thrive | Opinion This is important since the altseason usually has a set rhythm. Early bull cycles see Bitcoin at the top, particularly after halving, as was the case in April 2024. This attracts capital. Investors frequently shift their gains into altcoins when Bitcoin cools and starts to consolidate. Large-cap rallies like Ethereum are fueled by this rotation, which is followed by sector-specific spikes in memecoins, AI tokens, and other narratives. However, conditions do not currently favor that change. The Altcoin Season Index is stuck below 30, far below the 75 threshold. Bitcoin dominance is still high at 64%, and risk appetite outside of BTC and ETH seems to be muted. Although the ETH/BTC ratio is rising, currently at 0.02405, and Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin on a 90-day basis, these signals are preliminary and not conclusive. Macro conditions may also be delaying the altseason. The amount of capital available for speculative assets like altcoins is limited by continuous quantitative tightening and persistently high interest rates. If rate cuts occur or Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, some analysts predict a shift in late 2025. Others caution that the wait may last until 2026 if there is no clear Ethereum breakout or regulatory clarity. The signal is clear for the time being. The road to altcoin season is still blocked in the absence of a reversal in volume flows, and it is difficult to overlook the $36 billion in lost demand.

2025-06-19T05:50:13,"Bitcoin Inflow: Sudden $484M Movement Sparks Crucial Market Questions","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Inflow: Sudden $484M Movement Sparks Crucial Market Questions A significant event recently captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community and market watchers: a massive Bitcoin inflow totaling nearly half a billion dollars hitting major spot exchanges within a single hour. This kind of large-scale movement is always noteworthy and prompts immediate questions about potential market implications. What Does This Bitcoin Inflow Mean? According to an alert from CryptoQuant, a platform specializing in on-chain data analysis, a staggering 4,635.92 BTC, valued at approximately $484.5 million at the time of the transfer, was detected moving onto spot exchanges in a concentrated period. For those closely monitoring the Bitcoin market , such a large inflow often suggests that holders might be preparing to sell, potentially increasing supply on exchanges and exerting downward pressure on price. However, the picture is rarely black and white in the complex world of crypto. While a sudden spike in exchange inflows can indicate potential selling pressure, it’s crucial to look deeper. On-chain data provides valuable clues, but interpreting them requires understanding various possibilities. Breaking Down the BTC to Exchanges Data The inflow wasn’t evenly distributed across all platforms. The vast majority of the BTC to exchanges movement was directed towards specific venues. The breakdown provided by CryptoQuant highlights the concentration: Coinbase Prime: Received the lion’s share with 3,581 BTC, accounting for approximately 77% of the total inflow. Coinbase Prime is an institutional-focused platform offering trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. Coinbase Advanced: Saw an inflow of 1,039 BTC, making up about 22% of the total. This platform caters more to experienced retail traders and potentially smaller institutions. Gemini: Received a smaller amount of 14 BTC, less than 1% of the total inflow. The heavy concentration on Coinbase platforms, particularly Coinbase Prime, is a key detail. CryptoQuant specifically noted that large deposits to custody-enabled platforms like these may simply reflect clients using exchange custody services. This is a critical nuance that challenges the immediate assumption of imminent selling. Why Track Crypto Exchange Flow? Understanding crypto exchange flow is a fundamental part of on-chain analysis for several reasons: Potential Selling Pressure: Generally, when a significant amount of cryptocurrency moves onto exchanges, it increases the available supply for trading, which can lead to selling pressure if those funds are intended to be liquidated. Liquidity Indicators: Exchange balances can give an idea of the readily available supply of an asset. High balances might suggest high potential liquidity for large trades. Sentiment Clues: Consistent outflows from exchanges (moving crypto to cold storage) are often seen as bullish indicators, suggesting holders plan to keep their assets long-term. Conversely, consistent inflows can be interpreted bearishly. Identifying Large Player Activity: Large, sudden movements like the one observed can signal activity from whales, institutions, or other significant market participants. Tracking these flows provides data points that complement traditional market analysis based on price charts and trading volume. Analyzing the Bitcoin Market Impact When a $484 million Bitcoin inflow occurs, traders and analysts immediately look for its impact on the spot price. Did Bitcoin’s price drop significantly shortly after this inflow was detected? Or did it hold steady? The potential impact on the Bitcoin market depends heavily on the intention behind the transfers. If this inflow was purely for selling, the market might see increased volatility and downward pressure. However, as CryptoQuant pointed out, the custody angle is vital. Many institutions and high-net-worth individuals use exchange custody services for security and convenience, even if they don’t intend to sell immediately. Depositing funds into a custody wallet on an exchange platform allows for easier and faster access if they *do* decide to trade in the future, or it might be part of a larger asset management strategy. It could also be related to over-the-counter (OTC) deals being settled or funds being moved in preparation for specific trading strategies that utilize exchange infrastructure. Beyond the Headlines: Deeper Crypto Analysis This event underscores the need for nuanced crypto analysis . Simply seeing a large inflow number and assuming a price crash would be an oversimplification. Effective analysis involves: Considering the Source: Which exchanges received the funds? Is it a retail-heavy platform or one known for institutional clients? Looking at Historical Context: Have similar inflows occurred recently? What were the market reactions then? Checking Other On-Chain Metrics: What are transaction counts doing? What about miner activity? Stablecoin flows? Combining On-Chain with Off-Chain Data: How does the inflow data correlate with news events, macroeconomic factors, or technical chart patterns? This particular $484M inflow, heavily concentrated on institutional platforms like Coinbase Prime, leans towards an interpretation that involves sophisticated players and potentially custody arrangements rather than an immediate, broad retail sell-off. While the funds are now in a position where they *could* be sold, their presence on custody platforms suggests intentions might be more complex than a simple market dump. Actionable Insight: For market participants, this event serves as a reminder to look beyond sensational headlines. A large inflow is a data point, but its meaning is derived from context. Pay attention to where the funds are going and consider the possibilities beyond just selling pressure, especially when institutional platforms are involved. Stay informed by following reliable on-chain data providers and combining their insights with broader market analysis. Summary The recent inflow of over $484 million in Bitcoin to exchanges, predominantly Coinbase, is a significant on-chain event. While large inflows can signal potential selling pressure, the concentration on institutional and custody-enabled platforms suggests the possibility of clients simply utilizing exchange custody services. This highlights the importance of detailed crypto analysis , looking beyond raw numbers to understand the context and potential motivations behind such large movements in the Bitcoin market . Tracking crypto exchange flow remains a crucial tool for gaining insight into potential market dynamics, but always consider the full picture.

2025-06-19T05:44:23,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $390M Inflow, Mark 8th Straight Day of Gains – Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping?","Bitcoin Spot ETFs have absorbed more than $12b in inflows since mid-April, yet its price remains stagnant. On June 18, US spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $389m, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflow surge, but the market has refused to rally in tandem. Analysts at 10X Research suggest that surface-level bullish signals are masking underlying selling pressure. Inflows into ETFs may look strong, but they are likely being offset by quiet distribution from large holders, miners, and over-the-counter desks. “There is a persistent bias toward highlighting positive developments—especially inflows and buying—while largely ignoring the equally important selling pressure,” the firm wrote in a report released Thursday. Why Bitcoin Isn’t Rallying—Even After $12 Billion in Inflows Why this report matters Bitcoin has absorbed over $24 billion in demand since mid-April—yet price action has stalled. Something beneath the surface is offsetting those inflows, and few are talking about it. While… pic.twitter.com/cgm7JVy5vz — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 19, 2025 No FOMO, No Fuel: Bitcoin Struggles as Retail and Risk Appetite Fade Beyond the inflows, several headwinds are dampening momentum. Retail participation, a key driver in previous bull runs, remains unusually muted. On-chain data shows a lack of smaller transactions (under $10,000), while Google Trends reveals low retail interest in Bitcoin compared to the frenzied peaks of 2017 and 2021. Without widespread retail speculation, the kind that creates parabolic moves, prices have little fuel to break higher. Geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty are also contributing to the stall. The Israel-Iran conflict , potential US tariff shifts and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve are creating a cautious risk environment. Despite Inflows, Market Stalls as Liquidations and Weak Liquidity Bite Bitcoin has responded by trading sideways, and recent liquidations totaling $1.2b in leveraged positions have only added downward pressure. Liquidity conditions remain tight. Since March 2025, USD liquidity has been flat to slightly negative, limiting the flow of capital into speculative assets like Bitcoin. Even with ETF demand, the broader environment lacks the monetary backdrop seen in previous rallies. At the same time, technical signals point to a market on edge. Volatility has compressed, a common precursor to large moves. Meanwhile, activity from long-dormant wallets has raised questions about whether early holders are exiting into strength. For now, momentum appears stuck. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and steady institutional inflows continue to make headlines, but the price action tells a different story. As 10X Research puts it, traders would do well to focus less on surface-level inflows and more on where real pressure is quietly building.

2025-06-19T05:40:31,"Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just Delayed, says Top Analyst","The post Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just Delayed, says Top Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-awaited altcoin season might not be here just yet, but there’s growing confidence that it’s only a matter of time. According to a financial analyst, recent updates from the U.S. Federal Reserve are setting the stage for what could be a major move in the crypto market, just not immediately. In fact, this “quiet time” could be the best chance to prepare before altcoins finally take off. Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided not to cut interest rates — again. This is the fourth straight time they’ve paused, keeping rates at 4.25%–4.50% . The reason? Inflation is still too high. Core inflation is sitting at 2.8%, while the Fed wants it closer to 2%. That means no fresh money is being pumped into the market right now. And without that, altcoins often struggle to rise in a big way. Big altcoin rallies usually need extra liquidity, cheap money, lower interest rates, or stimulus to really explode. Altcoins in Accumulation Phase Right now, the altcoin market is in what experts call the “accumulation phase. ” Prices are not crashing, but they’re not soaring either. Many coins are just moving sideways. It’s a quiet zone, and that’s when smart investors usually build their positions. Altcoins need two things to spark a full-blown rally: A drop in Bitcoin dominance (which is still strong above $100k) A return of market liquidity (which comes with rate cuts or printing more money) Until then, altcoins will mostly move based on their individual projects, news, and development progress. Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just delayed! One of the biggest triggers will be the U.S. Federal Reserve finally cutting interest rates. That could happen later this year. When it does, it will unlock more money and liquidity into the market. And that’s exactly when altcoins are expected to take off in a big way. Adding to this excitement, the Altcoin Index has just confirmed entry into the famous 4-Year Cycle Zone, the same pattern that led to massive altcoin rallies in both 2017 and 2021. This signals that altcoins may soon be ready for another explosive run.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-isnt-cancelled-just-delayed-says-top-analyst/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
