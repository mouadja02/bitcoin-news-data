2025-06-19T07:37:12,"Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure","The post Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As web3 scales across new chains, verticals, and user experiences, one foundational layer has remained frustratingly stagnant: oracles. While computation and storage have seen real breakthroughs, oracle infrastructure still relies heavily on permissioned setups, opaque pricing, and manual onboarding. The result is a bottleneck that slows innovation and burdens newer chains with long lead times and steep costs. Blocksense , a zero-knowledge-native oracle protocol launched in 2024, set out to change that. One year after raising a $4 million pre-seed round, the team has evolved from early-stage concept to active deployments across more than two dozen ecosystems. Live feeds now serve builders on Aztec, Citrea, Pharos, Aurora, TAC, Plume, BIMA, and Manta Network, with the protocol preparing to join EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS), and its SDK entering public release. From Seed Round to Ecosystem Integration In mid-2024, Blocksense raised funding to build oracle infrastructure from scratch. Programmable, verifiable, and open by design. That vision has materialized into a protocol with measurable traction. It uses a ZK rollup-inspired architecture that allows feed updates to be batched and verified through zero-knowledge proofs. This drastically reduces on-chain cost while maintaining full integrity. Consensus is secured using zkSchellingPoint , where reporters vote in secret and are only rewarded if their submissions match the final majority. These aren’t theoretical claims. Blocksense’s system is already live in testnet environments, with pull-model feeds supporting DeFi protocols, prediction markets, real-world attestations, and emerging use cases in AI inference. Oracle-as-Code: Programmability Comes to Data Feeds What truly distinguishes Blocksense from earlier oracle models is its programmability . Legacy oracles operate as walled gardens. Developers often need approvals just to get a new feed listed — a process that can take weeks and limit experimentation. Blocksense flips that model. With its SDK, developers can define oracle logic in a WebAssembly-compatible format, specifying exactly what data to fetch, how to process it, and under what conditions to publish it. Once deployed, these scripts can be executed by node operators and verified on-chain — without any centralized bottlenecks. This shift from “oracle-as-a-service” to “oracle-as-code” unlocks a wide range of new use cases: Pharos uses programmable feeds to resolve prediction markets based on game-theoretic input. TAC triggers smart account actions only when multi-agent intent conditions are met. Citrea leverages custom scripts to publish Bitcoin L2 state views to Ethereum. BIMA verifies off-chain deliberation outcomes from human and AI collectives. Plume relies on oracle scripts to validate real-world asset metadata from partner registries. Manta Network experiments with feeds that verify compliance proofs for zk-based DeFi access. The core design: developers write the logic, node operators execute it, and a zero-knowledge circuit verifies that the votes and aggregation were processed correctly — including cryptographic signature validation and consensus logic. The result is a verifiable, permissionless, and expressive oracle layer designed for modular web3. Scaling Securely Without Sacrificing Trustlessness Blocksense avoids centralized coordination through a blend of cryptography and incentives. Reporters are selected privately and vote without visibility into the network’s state. A structure that discourages collusion and bribery. The system then uses a ZK circuit to prove that only valid votes were counted and that results matched the majority. To support this, the team has grown to 30+ across protocol engineering, cryptography, and developer support. While initial operations are backed by a trusted node set, decentralization is evolving — with open script publishing already live and full operator participation on the roadmap. The upcoming EigenLayer integration will deepen security by allowing Ethereum-aligned stakers to secure Blocksense as an AVS, aligning incentives across protocols, operators, and feed authors. What’s Next for Oracle Infrastructure? Blocksense envisions oracles not just as data feeds, but as middleware for intersubjective truth . The kind needed to verify AI outputs, trigger intent-based contracts, or synchronize decisions across modular systems. For Q2 and beyond, the team is focused on: Finalizing the public SDK for permissionless script creation Expanding support for non-price data formats and AI-related feeds Automating deployment pipelines for new rollups and alt-VMs Scaling incentives for reporters via MEV/OEV participation and AVS yield alignment With its 30+ network integrations, Blocksense is already powering applications that would be impossible to serve through legacy oracle frameworks. Conclusion In 2024, Blocksense raised capital to challenge how oracle data is produced, verified, and consumed. One year later, it has turned that capital into live infrastructure — tested, adopted, and used by real-world developers. Where many protocols celebrate fundraising as a milestone, Blocksense sees it as a starting point. What matters more is the shift it represents: away from permissioned data, toward a world where any developer can define how truth is derived on-chain. For builders seeking autonomy over their data layer, that shift is already underway.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/blocksense-moves-beyond-oracle-bottleneck-with-verifiable-permissionless-infrastructure/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZK","Information",cryptocompare

The total valuation of the industry has dipped slightly to $3.26 trillion. Trading volumes, too, have taken a hit, down by 9% indicating cautious moves by market participants. Talking about blue chip coins, Bitcoin is changing hands at $104,991.34, while Ethereum trades at $2524.22. XRP is slightly down at $2.16, holding on to gains from earlier in the week. The business appears to be in a consolidation phase, with volumes reducing and price ranges tightening. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price continues to hover around the $105k mark, showing resilience despite geopolitical instability. On the charts, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a potential breakout, although the direction remains uncertain. It is worth noting that the support lies at $103,600, and a break below this could drag BTC toward the psychological $100k mark. Contrarily, the bulls must reclaim their foothold at $105,500 and aim for a breakout toward $108,000, where significant resistance awaits. However, with intraday volume at $48.42 billion, down nearly 9%, any upside may be capped unless fresh momentum arrives. Curious about BTC’s long-term growth? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum has been range-bound, with prices slipping 0.54% to $2524.22. However, whale wallets have been actively accumulating, which is a healthy sign for a possible breakout. Traders should take note that the 24H low of $2469.05 serves as immediate support. If ETH price holds above $2,500, a short-term rally to $2,600 is possible. Conversely, falling below $2,460 could take ETH back toward the $2,400 demand zone. That being said, the drop in 24H volume by 17.65% may reflect weakening conviction among retail traders. Interested in stacking some Ether?

2025-06-19T07:22:17,"Analysis: Bitcoin’s dormant supply growth outpaces new issuance for the first time in history","For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the amount of BTC held dormant for a decade or more is now growing faster than the network is producing new coins. This shift, which began shortly after the April 2024 halving, marks a critical turning point in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply dynamics, according to a June 18 report by Fidelity Digital Assets. As of June 8, an average of 566 BTC per day is crossing into the “ancient supply” category, meaning the coins have not moved in 10 years or more. That figure now exceeds the network’s post-halving daily issuance rate of 450 BTC. Fidelity’s analysis stresses how the growing influence of long-term holders is redefining Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative in real-time. Dormant coins are often interpreted as a sign of conviction, or in some cases, permanent loss due to inaccessible private keys. Regardless of motive, the numbers are significant. Over 3.4 million BTC, more than 17% of the total supply, have not moved in at least a decade. That figure includes coins mined in Bitcoin’s early years, with Satoshi Nakamoto considered the first 10-year holder as of January 2019. You might also like: Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable This trend is more than symbolic. Fidelity notes that fewer than 3% of days since 2019 have seen a decline in ancient supply, while the portion of coins held for five years or more is also decreasing far less often than it rises. At the same time, public companies are increasingly contributing to this long-term cohort. As of June 8, 27 listed firms held more than 800,000 BTC combined. Projections suggest ancient supply could account for 30% of all Bitcoin in circulation by 2035 if this pattern holds. Still, high conviction isn’t absolute. Since the 2024 U.S. election, the report notes that ancient supply has fallen day-to-day 10% of the time, about four times the historical average. For holders of five years or more, that volatility is even higher, with 39% of days showing net outflows. These movements partly explain the choppy price action in early 2025 and serve as a reminder that even long-term holders can be shaken in uncertain markets. Fidelity emphasizes that scarcity is not the only factor influencing price. However, when issuance is decreasing and long-term supply is tightening, there is a greater chance of upward price pressure, especially if institutional and new ETF product demand picks up speed.

2025-06-19T07:10:28,"BTC mining difficulty drops slightly — could MUTM be the quiet beneficiary?","The Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty has recently dipped after it hit a new all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, 2025. Since then, the mining difficulty has dipped to around 126.4 trillion. A higher mining difficulty and the network hashrate are separate but related measures of the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol. A rising difficulty indicates rising competition and higher costs for miners. This rising difficulty has increased pressures on miners, especially following the reduction of block rewards after the April 2024 halving. This has seen small miners pushed to the edges as it has become harder to remain profitable. Amid the rising competition, some publicly traded companies like MARA are doubling down and growing their capacity; meanwhile, small miners are having to join mining pools. This new dynamic in the BTC mining sector has also seen some miners look for opportunities for profitability elsewhere. A major point of focus is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which is currently in phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a new source of growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the DeFi industry that aims to usher in a new era for DeFi lending. The project utilizes a unique protocol design and an overarching framework that ensures the long-term viability of the protocol. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can join as lenders or borrowers. Lenders deposit their assets in the pools and earn interest in return. The interest rate that they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises. This rising rate encourages borrowers to repay their loans while attracting more lenders looking for bigger yields. As liquidity flows into the pool, the utilization rate drops. The result is a positive feedback loop that ensures liquidity growth and optimal capital efficiency. To project liquidity in the pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has implemented various measures. One of these measures is the use of deposit and borrow caps. The deposit caps define the maximum amount of a given asset that can be supplied to the protocol. Such a cap ensures that the protocol does not have too much exposure to a potentially destabilizing asset. Additionally, it helps to deal with the exploit of infinite asset minting. The deposit cap is usually set by evaluating the on-chain activity, the price stability, and the historical asset performance. When it comes to borrowing caps, it represents the maximum amount of an asset that can be borrowed from the protocol. The cap is used for tokens that show signs of possible price manipulation or signs of problems with their liquidity. By capping their borrowing volume, Mutuum Finance mitigates the potential impact of the token on the solvency of the ecosystem due to price fluctuations. In some cases, Mutuum Finance may place assets in the restricted mode. That means that an asset can only be used for borrowing an asset of the same type. The restricted mode is imposed when the oracle data shows signs of being prone to manipulation. That ensures that the protocol does not expose the system-wide danger of default if a token experiences sudden artificial price movement. Mutuum Finance can also use the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) mode for assets that show signs of positive price correlation. When an asset is granted the ECE mode, it can access elevated borrowing limits. That ensures better capital efficiency for participants in such a pool, while limiting any systemic fallout to the ecosystem. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase. Tokens in phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. So far, over $10.75 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,200 unique buyers. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price is set to go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That increase will cut the expected ROI based on the planned listing price of 40.06 from 100% to 71.43%. Seeking to avoid that cut, the phase presale has experienced a blazing speed of participation, with around 40% of the tokens set aside for the phase already sold, barely two weeks after it started. Another major driver of the current pace of the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to give ten lucky participants in the presale $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for the giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting DeFi project that is forecast to offer returns of 20x or more when it goes live. The ongoing presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.03, presents the perfect opportunity to position your crypto portfolio for massive gains.

Goldman Sachs says in a note to investors that the “Prominent 10” companies in China may be the country’s answer to the “Magnificent 7” companies in the US, reports Investopedia. Says Goldman Sachs’ analysts, “[The ten companies] embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global,’ services and new forms of consumption and China’s improving shareholder returns.” The bank’s analysts say that a favorable regulatory environment and artificial intelligence investments may boost the earnings of the ten public-owned enterprises (POEs) by 13% in each of the next two years. The companies include the gaming and multimedia giant Tencent, e-commerce firm Alibaba, smartphone maker Xiaomi, EV maker BYD, shopping platform Meituan, online gaming firm NetEase, home appliance maker Midea, pharmaceutical company Hengrui, online travel agency Trip.com and sports equipment company ANTA. The Magnificent Seven companies include Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Goldman Sachs’ bullish outlook also factors in the Chinese equity market’s relative segmentation and modest valuations. Another consideration by the bank’s analysts is the Chinese government’s recent move to increase support for the private economy, as well as updated regulations to make mergers and acquisitions easier. Say the bank’s analysts, “All these should help revitalize POEs’ investment appetite (animal spirits), thereby supporting their organic and acquisitive growth down the road.” Source: Kris/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Additionally, Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins account for around a third of the ancient supply, but a portion is likely lost. However, since the 2024 US election, ancient supply has declined more frequently, suggesting some long-term holders are moving coins or taking profit in response to market uncertainty. The research also noted that as of June 8, the supply of five-year holders has decreased on a day-to-day basis 39% of the time following the election, three times more than the typical rate of 13%. “This long-term holder movement may help explain some of the sideways and downward price action observed during the first quarter of 2025,” Wainwright observed. “It also shows that ancient supply outpacing incoming supply on average does not necessarily lead to higher prices and can have an inverse effect in shorter timeframes as supply movements increase.” Bitcoin has only gained around 12% so far this year, which is supposed to be the peak of the bull market cycle , if history repeats. A Unique Attribute The researcher concluded that it is possible that the ancient supply increases and long-term holding behavior “may become more common in the future as new digital asset-focused investment products emerge and institutional adoption increases.” “This is one of the most unique attributes of Bitcoin that no other existing investment or commodity currently possesses—and one that could become increasingly important if demand rises as ancient supply grows.” Meanwhile, Glassnode reported that profit-taking behavior among different cohorts had flipped.

2025-06-19T06:38:31,"Is Grayscale XRP ETF Approval Just 240 Days Away?","The post Is Grayscale XRP ETF Approval Just 240 Days Away? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News 2025 has been a rollercoaster year for XRP. On January 16 , XRP touched an all-time high of $3.39 . Since then, the price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle , and experts believe a breakout is imminent . Now, the spotlight is back on XRP as Grayscale has filed to convert its XRP Trust into a publicly traded ETF —a move that could change everything for the XRP market. Grayscale Files for XRP ETF, SEC Acknowledges Application Grayscale is pushing to transform its XRP Trust into an ETF , and it has officially applied to the SEC . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has now acknowledged the filing , triggering a 240-day countdown for approval or rejection. BREAKING: A new $XRP ETF could be on the way. The SEC just acknowledged a proposal by Grayscale. And if approved, it could shake the crypto world. Here’s what’s happening — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) June 18, 2025 Why an XRP ETF Could Be a Game-Changer With a market cap of $128 billion and 24-hour volume of $2.6 billion , XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum (excluding stablecoins). If the XRP ETF gets approved: Traditional investors could enter the XRP market. It would boost liquidity and trading volumes . It could solidify XRP’s status alongside BTC and ETH —both of which already have ETFs. Ripple vs SEC Legal Settlement Strengthens the Case Ripple and the SEC are moving toward a final settlement. They’ve filed a joint motion to release $125 million in escrow , with $75M returning to Ripple and $50M going to the SEC . This step signals the end of a years-long legal battle , improving XRP’s position for ETF approval. XRP Price Gains and Political Tailwinds Support ETF Hopes XRP’s performance in the last year has been strong: 340.1% rise in the last 12 months 4.02% growth this quarter 0.45% gain in the previous quarter The broader market sentiment is also bullish. Pro-crypto U.S. President Donald Trump has implemented crypto-friendly policies , further fueling optimism around XRP and digital assets. What Could Happen Next: Timeline and Challenges Ahead While excitement is high, approval is not guaranteed . Crypto researcher Ripple Van Winkle cautions that: The SEC has historically been slow to approve crypto ETFs . XRP’s past legal issues with the SEC could complicate the review. If rejected, it would signal ongoing regulatory resistance to crypto, especially XRP. Bottom Line The XRP ETF application is a potential turning point . With strong price momentum, growing legal clarity, and a more supportive U.S. government, all eyes are now on the SEC’s next move.

2025-06-19T06:32:56,"UK Wants Banks to Have Less Exposure to Crypto by Next Year – Here’s Why","The Bank of England (BOE) is considering a proposal that would restrict UK banks’ exposure to crypto by 2026. Speaking at the Risk Live Europe event in London on Wednesday, the central bank executive director, David Bailey, noted that the UK’s upcoming rules would be more on the “restrictive end.” He specified that banks would be encouraged to keep a low crypto exposure. “There are also examples where it might be more appropriate to start more towards the restrictive end of the spectrum,” he said. “The prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets, and specifically those with features associated with heightened price volatility and where investors could lose the entirety of their investment, is an example in this space.” UK Rules to be ‘Informed’ by Basel Committee Standards Besides, the UK is working to enact the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s disclosure framework for crypto exposure . This includes “standardized set of public tables and templates covering banks’ crypto exposures.” The Basel Committee originally indicated crypto disclosures to arrive by January 2025; however, it extended the deadline by another year. Further, the Basel Committee recommended that banks allow only 1% of their investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . FCA Set to Implement New Crypto Regime The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been pushing to establish a clear framework for cryptoasset firms in the country. The regulator’s “ gateway regime ” is earmarked for 2026, which will act as a new authorization for crypto companies. The regulator is also looking to finalize its regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto custody. The FCA is currently seeking public input on its stablecoin regulation plan. The restrictions on banks’ crypto exposure come at a time when European banks are increasingly involved in crypto. Though the EU watchdog, ESMA, noted that 95% of EU banks do not engage in crypto activities, banks like BBVA have gone ahead in advising wealthy customers to invest in crypto. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1935216936985755992 The post UK Wants Banks to Have Less Exposure to Crypto by Next Year – Here’s Why appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-wants-banks-to-have-less-exposure-to-crypto-by-next-year-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Blockchain News|FCA|UK",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T06:30:51,"Why OKB Price Prediction 2025 Signals a Bullish Year and Qubetics $18M Presale Hints at 4349% ROI","Cryptocurrency market participants closely follow key assets like OKB to gauge future trends. The OKB token, native to one of the largest global exchanges, has shown considerable resilience and steady growth potential. This article provides an in-depth look at the OKB price prediction 2025, dissecting monthly forecasts alongside an exploration of Qubetics , a promising new blockchain project that focuses on solving the critical issue of interoperability. As blockchain becomes increasingly interconnected, projects like Qubetics that enable seamless cross-chain functionality are poised to redefine the market dynamics. Alongside the technical analysis of OKB’s price trajectory, a thorough breakdown of Qubetics’ latest crypto presale data and its growth potential highlights a dual narrative of stability and innovation in crypto. What the Numbers Say: OKB Price Prediction 2025 OKB’s price outlook for 2025 shows promising stability with an optimistic growth trend. Based on extensive technical analysis, the minimum expected price for OKB in 2025 is around $46.09, while its peak could reach $51.58. The average trading price across the year is projected near $57.06, suggesting a modest yet meaningful potential return on investment. Breaking this down further, June 2025 forecasts an average price of $57.06, with a price floor of $51.11 and potential to surge slightly higher. This phase shows a potential return on investment (ROI) of approximately 20.4%. July follows closely with a similar average forecast near $54.14, a floor of $51.43, and a peak just under $57, maintaining consistent momentum. August appears to mark a subtle cooling, with analysts expecting an average OKB price around $52.09 and a tighter price range between $51.37 and $52.81. The ROI here moderates to about 11.5%, reflecting typical seasonal market fluctuations. September’s forecast continues this trend with a slightly lower floor price near $50.03 and a peak of $52.38, averaging $51.21 for the month. October expects OKB trading in the range of $49.14 to $53.57, settling at an average of $51.36. November offers a stronger outlook, with a floor price near $50.90 and peaks around $55.18, which raises the average forecast to $53.04 and an ROI climbing back to 16.5%. December closes the year with a broader price range from $46.09 to $53.60 and an average around $49.85, reflecting the typical year-end volatility and a final estimated ROI of 13.1%. Throughout 2025, OKB’s price stability, combined with moderate upward potential, indicates a crypto asset that is solidifying its market presence while offering growth aligned with broader industry trends. Why Qubetics’ Interoperability Might Change Blockchain Among emerging cryptocurrencies, Qubetics stands out for one major technical innovation: interoperability. Unlike many blockchains that operate in silos, Qubetics is architected as a Web3 aggregated chain designed to unify multiple networks, including the Bitcoin blockchain, into a single cohesive ecosystem. This interoperability means that Qubetics facilitates effortless interaction and integration between decentralized applications (DApps), tokens, and data across different chains. In practical terms, users and developers can execute cross-chain transactions, transfer assets, and share data seamlessly. This level of integration addresses a key limitation in blockchain technology today, where fragmentation impedes scalability and broad adoption. As blockchain use cases expand from finance to supply chains and beyond, interoperability will be a major driver for adoption. Qubetics’ approach represents a critical step forward in creating a unified blockchain experience that could boost future growth. Qubetics Presale: A Snapshot of Momentum Currently, Qubetics is in its final public sale phase, with fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remaining at the fixed presale price of $0.3370. This stage marks the last opportunity to acquire tokens before an anticipated listing price increase to approximately $0.40, representing an expected 20% gain at launch. The project has already raised over $18 million through the crypto presale , with more than 28,000 token holders participating. Approximately 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, indicating strong community and market interest. Notably, the tokenomics were recently adjusted to slash the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens. This reduction creates immediate scarcity and sets a foundation for potential long-term value appreciation. Qubetics Price Prediction: What Happens if $20,000 Enters Qubetics Assuming a purchase of $20,000 worth of $TICS at the current presale price of $0.3370 per token, the buyer would receive approximately 59,340 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches the expected listing value of $0.40, the portfolio value would increase to about $23,736. Should the price escalate to $1 post-presale, the same holding would be worth $59,340, yielding a 196% return on the original amount. At a $5 valuation, the portfolio’s value would climb to $296,700, translating to a remarkable 1,383% gain. Further along, at a $10 price point after the mainnet launch, the holdings would be worth nearly $593,400, marking an extraordinary 2,866% increase. Finally, if the token’s value hits $15, the portfolio value would surge to $890,100, representing an exceptional 4,349% ROI. As always, market conditions and external factors will influence real outcomes, and caution remains necessary. Conclusion: A Dual Perspective on Crypto Potential in 2025 The OKB price prediction 2025 presents a stable, promising outlook with gradual appreciation and moderate volatility. Conversely, Qubetics ’ core interoperability feature addresses one of the most critical challenges in the industry—enabling seamless cross-chain interactions. The ongoing presale and adjusted tokenomics create a unique entry with tangible scarcity and potential for rapid value appreciation. Understanding both provides a comprehensive view of what the future may hold for cryptocurrency markets.

2025-06-19T06:20:11,"AI Startups: Unlock Crucial VC Funding Secrets","BitcoinWorld AI Startups: Unlock Crucial VC Funding Secrets In the fast-paced world of technology and cryptocurrency, the spotlight often shines on disruptive innovation. Right now, that spotlight is firmly on artificial intelligence. With AI investments soaring past $110 billion in 2024, securing VC funding for AI startups is more competitive than ever. While the influx of capital presents opportunities, it also demands that early-stage companies find effective ways to stand out from the crowd. Beyond the Pitch: What Venture Capitalists Really Want Forget the glossy slides and perfect delivery. According to seasoned investors like Jill Chase of CapitalG, Kanu Gulati of Khosla Ventures, and Sara Ittelson of Accel, the real substance lies elsewhere. At Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, these venture capital experts shared insights that challenge conventional wisdom for AI founders seeking startup investment. Their consensus? Stop fixating on the ‘perfect pitch.’ While clarity is important, VCs are looking for deeper signals. Building genuine relationships and establishing trust with potential investors often matters more than rehearsing every line of a presentation. This approach helps VCs understand the team, the vision, and the underlying potential beyond the immediate market trends. Navigating the Hype Cycle and Competition for AI Startups The AI landscape is currently experiencing significant hype. For AI startups, this means navigating inflated expectations and the risk of being overshadowed or, conversely, fueling unsustainable growth. VCs are keenly aware of this cycle and look for startups with a clear strategy for long-term survival and growth, not just riding the current wave. A critical challenge discussed was competing with large incumbents. Big tech companies have resources, data, and established market positions. Startups need a compelling answer to how they will differentiate, find their niche, and gain traction without getting crushed. This often involves focusing on specific problems, leveraging unique data, or developing proprietary technology that provides a distinct advantage. Consumer Focus and Speed Drive Startup Investment Interestingly, even in the often complex world of B2B AI, a consumer-centric approach and speed remain powerful differentiators. VCs noted that companies that prioritize user experience, ease of adoption, and rapid iteration often win, regardless of whether their end customer is a business or an individual. The ability to quickly adapt to feedback and demonstrate tangible value is key to securing venture capital. Key attributes VCs seek: Strong Team: Passionate, knowledgeable founders with the ability to execute. Clear Problem/Solution: Addressing a real market need with a viable AI-powered solution. Demonstrated Traction: Early signs of product-market fit, user adoption, or revenue. Defensible Technology: Proprietary tech, data advantage, or network effects. Understanding of Market Dynamics: Awareness of competition, incumbents, and future trends. Trustworthiness: Honesty, transparency, and reliability in communication. Agents and Automation Reshaping the Playbook The rise of AI agents and automation is not just changing industries; it’s also changing how startups themselves operate. VCs are observing how these technologies can create more efficient, scalable business models. Startups leveraging automation internally or building agent-based solutions are seen as potentially having a structural advantage in the market, influencing their attractiveness for startup investment. Conclusion: Building Trust in a Competitive Landscape The path from Seed to Series C for AI startups in 2025 requires more than just a groundbreaking idea and a polished pitch deck. It demands resilience, a deep understanding of market dynamics, the ability to build trust with investors and customers, and a clear strategy for navigating hype and competition. Focusing on these core principles, as highlighted by leading venture capital firms, can significantly increase a startup’s chances of securing the necessary funding to scale and succeed in the AI era.

2025-06-19T06:17:05,"New York officials secure over $400k in crypto from Facebook ad scam","Over $440,000 in stolen crypto funds has been secured by New York officials in an ongoing fraud investigation that targeted locals. Authorities from the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Attorney General’s Office, and the New York State Department of Financial Services jointly disrupted a multi-layered cryptocurrency scam operation that had primarily targeted Russian-speaking residents in Brooklyn and across the United States. As part of the enforcement action, $140,000 in digital assets was seized, while an additional $300,000 was frozen in crypto accounts linked to the scheme. The scammers operated a malicious advertisement network across social media platforms that promoted dubious investment schemes to target unsuspecting crypto investors. The investigation into the scheme, known as “Black Hat” advertising, began in October 2024 when NYDFS detected a fake website, WhalesTrade.com, falsely displaying a BitLicense certification. The site was traced to a broader network of fraudulent platforms used to trick victims into sending cryptocurrency under the guise of high-return investment opportunities. You might also like: DOJ seeks forfeiture of $225m tied to crypto ‘pig butchering’ scams Many of the platforms used Russian-language advertisements and impersonated known personalities to gain credibility. Once victims clicked on the ads, scammers shifted communication to encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, creating the illusion of legitimate investment interactions. Initial investments were met with fabricated account statements showing inflated returns, to motivate victims to send even more money. When users attempted to withdraw their funds, they were blocked or asked to pay bogus withdrawal fees and taxes . Eventually, scammers completely cut off communication and disappear. More than 300 victims have been identified, with Brooklyn alone accounting for over $1 million in estimated losses. Officials reported that Meta, Facebook’s parent company, shut down over 700 Facebook accounts tied to the scam after being alerted to the investigation. Authorities have also dismantled a network of more than 100 fraudulent domains and 17 registrar accounts used to lure unsuspecting investors. To bypass Facebook’s ad restrictions, the scammers hired “Black Hat” advertisers based in Vietnam and paid them with stolen crypto to run deceptive ads. Authorities found that the scammers converted Bitcoin into Vietnamese currency to fund the campaign, prompting a court order to freeze $300,000 in related accounts. This case is just one example in a string of scams that have weaponized digital advertising to steal from unsuspecting crypto investors. Similar tactics were seen earlier in 2024 when fake versions of platforms like Whales Market and Revoke Cash appeared as sponsored links on Google, tricking users into connecting their wallets to phishing sites. In some instances, even trusted services were impersonated with near-identical domain names, draining user funds through malicious scripts. Despite efforts by companies like Google and Meta to curb such abuse, fraudulent ads continue to surface.

2025-06-19T06:15:41,"Don’t bet on altcoin season yet — what this $36B metric says about the timing","Despite Bitcoin’s recent climb above $110,000, altcoins remain stuck in a bearish rut, raising doubts about whether the long-awaited “altcoin season” will materialize anytime soon. According to a June 18 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Burrakesmeci, one metric tells a compelling story. The 1 – Year Cumulative Buy/Sell Quote Volume Difference for Altcoins, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), now sits at –$36 billion. This level that suggests investors are still pulling money from the altcoin market. The net demand from traders putting buy versus sell quotes on altcoin pairs across exchanges is reflected in this metric. It often indicates peak interest and occasionally a local top when it flips positive, as it did in December 2024. The trend has since reversed, with sustained outflows rather than inflows, as confirmed by the current reading which is in extremely negative territory. In short, altcoin investors are still sitting on the sidelines, even as Bitcoin dominates headlines. You might also like: Altcoin season is over: Here’s what can make a project thrive | Opinion This is important since the altseason usually has a set rhythm. Early bull cycles see Bitcoin at the top, particularly after halving, as was the case in April 2024. This attracts capital. Investors frequently shift their gains into altcoins when Bitcoin cools and starts to consolidate. Large-cap rallies like Ethereum are fueled by this rotation, which is followed by sector-specific spikes in memecoins, AI tokens, and other narratives. However, conditions do not currently favor that change. The Altcoin Season Index is stuck below 30, far below the 75 threshold. Bitcoin dominance is still high at 64%, and risk appetite outside of BTC and ETH seems to be muted. Although the ETH/BTC ratio is rising, currently at 0.02405, and Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin on a 90-day basis, these signals are preliminary and not conclusive. Macro conditions may also be delaying the altseason. The amount of capital available for speculative assets like altcoins is limited by continuous quantitative tightening and persistently high interest rates. If rate cuts occur or Bitcoin’s dominance wanes, some analysts predict a shift in late 2025. Others caution that the wait may last until 2026 if there is no clear Ethereum breakout or regulatory clarity. The signal is clear for the time being. The road to altcoin season is still blocked in the absence of a reversal in volume flows, and it is difficult to overlook the $36 billion in lost demand.

2025-06-19T05:50:13,"Bitcoin Inflow: Sudden $484M Movement Sparks Crucial Market Questions","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Inflow: Sudden $484M Movement Sparks Crucial Market Questions A significant event recently captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community and market watchers: a massive Bitcoin inflow totaling nearly half a billion dollars hitting major spot exchanges within a single hour. This kind of large-scale movement is always noteworthy and prompts immediate questions about potential market implications. What Does This Bitcoin Inflow Mean? According to an alert from CryptoQuant, a platform specializing in on-chain data analysis, a staggering 4,635.92 BTC, valued at approximately $484.5 million at the time of the transfer, was detected moving onto spot exchanges in a concentrated period. For those closely monitoring the Bitcoin market , such a large inflow often suggests that holders might be preparing to sell, potentially increasing supply on exchanges and exerting downward pressure on price. However, the picture is rarely black and white in the complex world of crypto. While a sudden spike in exchange inflows can indicate potential selling pressure, it’s crucial to look deeper. On-chain data provides valuable clues, but interpreting them requires understanding various possibilities. Breaking Down the BTC to Exchanges Data The inflow wasn’t evenly distributed across all platforms. The vast majority of the BTC to exchanges movement was directed towards specific venues. The breakdown provided by CryptoQuant highlights the concentration: Coinbase Prime: Received the lion’s share with 3,581 BTC, accounting for approximately 77% of the total inflow. Coinbase Prime is an institutional-focused platform offering trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. Coinbase Advanced: Saw an inflow of 1,039 BTC, making up about 22% of the total. This platform caters more to experienced retail traders and potentially smaller institutions. Gemini: Received a smaller amount of 14 BTC, less than 1% of the total inflow. The heavy concentration on Coinbase platforms, particularly Coinbase Prime, is a key detail. CryptoQuant specifically noted that large deposits to custody-enabled platforms like these may simply reflect clients using exchange custody services. This is a critical nuance that challenges the immediate assumption of imminent selling. Why Track Crypto Exchange Flow? Understanding crypto exchange flow is a fundamental part of on-chain analysis for several reasons: Potential Selling Pressure: Generally, when a significant amount of cryptocurrency moves onto exchanges, it increases the available supply for trading, which can lead to selling pressure if those funds are intended to be liquidated. Liquidity Indicators: Exchange balances can give an idea of the readily available supply of an asset. High balances might suggest high potential liquidity for large trades. Sentiment Clues: Consistent outflows from exchanges (moving crypto to cold storage) are often seen as bullish indicators, suggesting holders plan to keep their assets long-term. Conversely, consistent inflows can be interpreted bearishly. Identifying Large Player Activity: Large, sudden movements like the one observed can signal activity from whales, institutions, or other significant market participants. Tracking these flows provides data points that complement traditional market analysis based on price charts and trading volume. Analyzing the Bitcoin Market Impact When a $484 million Bitcoin inflow occurs, traders and analysts immediately look for its impact on the spot price. Did Bitcoin’s price drop significantly shortly after this inflow was detected? Or did it hold steady? The potential impact on the Bitcoin market depends heavily on the intention behind the transfers. If this inflow was purely for selling, the market might see increased volatility and downward pressure. However, as CryptoQuant pointed out, the custody angle is vital. Many institutions and high-net-worth individuals use exchange custody services for security and convenience, even if they don’t intend to sell immediately. Depositing funds into a custody wallet on an exchange platform allows for easier and faster access if they *do* decide to trade in the future, or it might be part of a larger asset management strategy. It could also be related to over-the-counter (OTC) deals being settled or funds being moved in preparation for specific trading strategies that utilize exchange infrastructure. Beyond the Headlines: Deeper Crypto Analysis This event underscores the need for nuanced crypto analysis . Simply seeing a large inflow number and assuming a price crash would be an oversimplification. Effective analysis involves: Considering the Source: Which exchanges received the funds? Is it a retail-heavy platform or one known for institutional clients? Looking at Historical Context: Have similar inflows occurred recently? What were the market reactions then? Checking Other On-Chain Metrics: What are transaction counts doing? What about miner activity? Stablecoin flows? Combining On-Chain with Off-Chain Data: How does the inflow data correlate with news events, macroeconomic factors, or technical chart patterns? This particular $484M inflow, heavily concentrated on institutional platforms like Coinbase Prime, leans towards an interpretation that involves sophisticated players and potentially custody arrangements rather than an immediate, broad retail sell-off. While the funds are now in a position where they *could* be sold, their presence on custody platforms suggests intentions might be more complex than a simple market dump. Actionable Insight: For market participants, this event serves as a reminder to look beyond sensational headlines. A large inflow is a data point, but its meaning is derived from context. Pay attention to where the funds are going and consider the possibilities beyond just selling pressure, especially when institutional platforms are involved. Stay informed by following reliable on-chain data providers and combining their insights with broader market analysis. Summary The recent inflow of over $484 million in Bitcoin to exchanges, predominantly Coinbase, is a significant on-chain event. While large inflows can signal potential selling pressure, the concentration on institutional and custody-enabled platforms suggests the possibility of clients simply utilizing exchange custody services. This highlights the importance of detailed crypto analysis , looking beyond raw numbers to understand the context and potential motivations behind such large movements in the Bitcoin market .

2025-06-19T05:44:23,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $390M Inflow, Mark 8th Straight Day of Gains – Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping?","Bitcoin Spot ETFs have absorbed more than $12b in inflows since mid-April, yet its price remains stagnant. On June 18, US spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $389m, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflow surge, but the market has refused to rally in tandem. Analysts at 10X Research suggest that surface-level bullish signals are masking underlying selling pressure. Inflows into ETFs may look strong, but they are likely being offset by quiet distribution from large holders, miners, and over-the-counter desks. “There is a persistent bias toward highlighting positive developments—especially inflows and buying—while largely ignoring the equally important selling pressure,” the firm wrote in a report released Thursday. Why Bitcoin Isn’t Rallying—Even After $12 Billion in Inflows Why this report matters Bitcoin has absorbed over $24 billion in demand since mid-April—yet price action has stalled. Something beneath the surface is offsetting those inflows, and few are talking about it. While… pic.twitter.com/cgm7JVy5vz — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 19, 2025 No FOMO, No Fuel: Bitcoin Struggles as Retail and Risk Appetite Fade Beyond the inflows, several headwinds are dampening momentum. Retail participation, a key driver in previous bull runs, remains unusually muted. On-chain data shows a lack of smaller transactions (under $10,000), while Google Trends reveals low retail interest in Bitcoin compared to the frenzied peaks of 2017 and 2021. Without widespread retail speculation, the kind that creates parabolic moves, prices have little fuel to break higher. Geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty are also contributing to the stall. The Israel-Iran conflict , potential US tariff shifts and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve are creating a cautious risk environment. Despite Inflows, Market Stalls as Liquidations and Weak Liquidity Bite Bitcoin has responded by trading sideways, and recent liquidations totaling $1.2b in leveraged positions have only added downward pressure. Liquidity conditions remain tight. Since March 2025, USD liquidity has been flat to slightly negative, limiting the flow of capital into speculative assets like Bitcoin. Even with ETF demand, the broader environment lacks the monetary backdrop seen in previous rallies. At the same time, technical signals point to a market on edge. Volatility has compressed, a common precursor to large moves. Meanwhile, activity from long-dormant wallets has raised questions about whether early holders are exiting into strength. For now, momentum appears stuck. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and steady institutional inflows continue to make headlines, but the price action tells a different story. As 10X Research puts it, traders would do well to focus less on surface-level inflows and more on where real pressure is quietly building.

2025-06-19T05:40:31,"Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just Delayed, says Top Analyst","The post Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just Delayed, says Top Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-awaited altcoin season might not be here just yet, but there’s growing confidence that it’s only a matter of time. According to a financial analyst, recent updates from the U.S. Federal Reserve are setting the stage for what could be a major move in the crypto market, just not immediately. In fact, this “quiet time” could be the best chance to prepare before altcoins finally take off. Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided not to cut interest rates — again. This is the fourth straight time they’ve paused, keeping rates at 4.25%–4.50% . The reason? Inflation is still too high. Core inflation is sitting at 2.8%, while the Fed wants it closer to 2%. That means no fresh money is being pumped into the market right now. And without that, altcoins often struggle to rise in a big way. Big altcoin rallies usually need extra liquidity, cheap money, lower interest rates, or stimulus to really explode. Altcoins in Accumulation Phase Right now, the altcoin market is in what experts call the “accumulation phase. ” Prices are not crashing, but they’re not soaring either. Many coins are just moving sideways. It’s a quiet zone, and that’s when smart investors usually build their positions. Altcoins need two things to spark a full-blown rally: A drop in Bitcoin dominance (which is still strong above $100k) A return of market liquidity (which comes with rate cuts or printing more money) Until then, altcoins will mostly move based on their individual projects, news, and development progress. Altcoin Season isn’t Cancelled — Just delayed! One of the biggest triggers will be the U.S. Federal Reserve finally cutting interest rates. That could happen later this year. When it does, it will unlock more money and liquidity into the market. And that’s exactly when altcoins are expected to take off in a big way. Adding to this excitement, the Altcoin Index has just confirmed entry into the famous 4-Year Cycle Zone, the same pattern that led to massive altcoin rallies in both 2017 and 2021. This signals that altcoins may soon be ready for another explosive run.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-isnt-cancelled-just-delayed-says-top-analyst/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T05:40:08,"Jerome Powell Issues Crucial Warning on Tariffs and Inflation","BitcoinWorld Jerome Powell Issues Crucial Warning on Tariffs and Inflation Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently delivered a significant message that has implications far beyond traditional economic circles, potentially touching the crypto market . His remarks centered on the potential effects of tariff policies, specifically how they might influence both economic activity and, critically, tariffs inflation . What Did Jerome Powell Say About Tariffs and Inflation? Chairman Powell stated that the outcome of tariff policies isn’t uniform; it depends heavily on the specifics and the level of tariffs imposed. However, he issued a clear caution: significant tariff hikes, particularly those implemented this year, could have a twofold negative effect: Weighing on Economic Activity: Higher tariffs can increase costs for businesses, disrupt supply chains, and potentially reduce consumer spending as imported goods become more expensive. This can slow down overall economic growth. Potentially Boosting Inflation: Tariffs act like taxes on imports. When the cost of imported goods rises, businesses often pass those costs onto consumers, leading to higher prices across various sectors. This is a form of ‘cost-push’ inflation. This isn’t the typical inflation the Fed usually battles, which is often driven by strong consumer demand. Tariff-induced inflation is supply-side driven, making it a tricky challenge for monetary policy. How Do Tariffs Impact Economic Activity? Understanding the Economic Impact Let’s break down the mechanisms behind the potential negative economic impact of tariffs: Increased Costs for Businesses: Companies relying on imported raw materials or components face higher input costs. This can squeeze profit margins or force them to raise prices. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can complicate international trade relationships, forcing companies to find new suppliers or relocate production, which is costly and time-consuming. Reduced Consumer Spending: As the cost of imported goods (from cars to electronics to clothing) increases, consumers have less disposable income for other purchases. Retaliation: Countries hit by tariffs often retaliate with their own tariffs on the first country’s exports, hurting domestic industries that rely on international markets. Investment Uncertainty: The unpredictability of tariff policy can make businesses hesitant to invest in new projects, further slowing growth. All these factors contribute to a potential slowdown in the economy, impacting job growth and overall prosperity. Why Does This Matter for Fed Policy and Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve’s primary goals are maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). Fed policy , particularly decisions around Fed interest rates , is the main tool used to achieve this. Normally, if inflation is high due to strong demand, the Fed raises interest rates to cool the economy. If the economy is slowing, the Fed might lower rates to stimulate activity. However, tariffs present a dilemma. They can cause both inflation *and* a slowdown in economic activity simultaneously. If the Fed raises rates to combat tariff-induced inflation, they risk further harming an already weakening economy. If they keep rates low to support the economy, they might allow inflation to accelerate. This makes navigating monetary policy significantly more complex. What Could This Mean for the Crypto Market? Analyzing the Crypto Market Reaction The connection between macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and the crypto market is a subject of ongoing debate and observation. Here’s how Powell’s comments and the potential fallout could influence crypto: Inflation Hedge Narrative: If tariffs significantly boost inflation, some investors might turn to assets perceived as inflation hedges, like Bitcoin. This narrative gained traction during previous periods of high inflation. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as riskier assets. If tariffs lead to economic uncertainty and a slowdown, investors might move away from riskier investments (risk-off), potentially putting downward pressure on crypto prices. Conversely, if the inflation aspect dominates and conventional investments struggle, crypto might be seen as an alternative (risk-on in a different sense). Fed Policy Uncertainty: Any confusion or unpredictable moves from the Fed regarding interest rates can increase market volatility across the board, including crypto. Impact on Disposable Income: If tariffs reduce consumer purchasing power and harm the broader economy, it could potentially reduce the capital available for speculative investments like crypto. There isn’t a single guaranteed outcome. The crypto market reaction will likely depend on which factor dominates: the fear of inflation or the fear of economic slowdown. Navigating Macro Headwinds: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Given the potential complexities introduced by factors like tariffs and their impact on tariffs inflation and the broader economy, what should individuals interested in the crypto market consider? Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to major macroeconomic announcements, including statements from the Federal Reserve and data on inflation and economic growth. Understand the Links: Educate yourself on how traditional finance and economic policies can influence the crypto space. The world is interconnected. Consider Your Strategy: Are you investing in crypto as a long-term store of value, a speculative asset, or something else? Macro factors might influence the performance of different types of crypto assets differently. Think Long-Term: While short-term volatility can be influenced by macro news, many crypto investors focus on the long-term potential of the underlying technology and networks. Jerome Powell’s comments serve as a reminder that external economic forces play a significant role in the financial landscape, and understanding them is key to navigating any market, including crypto. The Bigger Picture: Global Trade and Inflation Trends The discussion around tariffs isn’t isolated to the U.S. economy. Trade policies have global repercussions. Changes in trade dynamics can shift manufacturing, alter supply chains worldwide, and impact inflation rates in multiple countries. As central banks globally grapple with post-pandemic inflation and potential economic slowdowns, trade policy adds another layer of complexity to their decisions. This interconnectedness means that developments like those highlighted by Jerome Powell can have ripple effects that eventually reach every corner of the global financial system, including digital asset markets. Summary: Jerome Powell’s warning about tariffs potentially boosting inflation and weighing on economic activity highlights a significant challenge for Fed policy . This complex macroeconomic environment, where inflation risks coexist with potential economic slowdowns, creates uncertainty that can influence the crypto market in various ways.

2025-06-19T05:36:32,"Trump Ally Joins Prenetics as It Buys 187 Bitcoin","Prenetics bought roughly 187 BTC at an average price of $106,712 each. Alongside the acquisition, the firm appointed former OKEx COO Andy Cheung to its board and added Tracy Hoyos Lopez, who helped shape Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, to its advisory team. The announcement boosted Prenetics’ stock by over 23%. Meanwhile, Norwegian brokerage K33 is also aggressively entering the Bitcoin space, and plans to raise $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. In contrast, political backlash erupted in the Czech Republic over a controversial $45 million Bitcoin donation from a convicted criminal to the Ministry of Justice. This led to resignations and a failed no-confidence vote. Prenetics Adds Bitcoin and Trump Advisor to Team Prenetics, a healthcare company with headquarters in both Hong Kong and the United States, announced a bold move into the Bitcoin space by investing $20 million to acquire about 187 BTC at an average price of $106,712 per coin. The purchase was secured through a Kraken custody account, and is the beginning of the firm’s strategy to become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the healthcare industry. This strategic pivot is very similar to the approach taken by other institutions like Strategy, which have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury reserves as well. Press release from Prenetics The company also revealed changes to its leadership structure to support this new direction. Andy Cheung, former chief operating officer of OKEx, will be joining the Prenetics board of directors. In addition, Tracy Hoyos Lopez, the Kraken executive credited with influencing former President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance during his campaign, joined the company’s advisory team. Lopez pointed out that Prenetics is well-positioned to capitalize on growing institutional adoption, especially given its improved financial standing and the changing regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. Prenetics reported a strong liquidity position of roughly $117 million, including its new Bitcoin holdings, cash, and short-term assets. After the announcement, the company’s stock (PRE) saw a boost of more than 23%over the past 24 hours. Prenetics stock price over the past day (Source: Google ) The move comes as the Trump administration continues to embrace digital assets. In March, President Trump issued an executive order calling for the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” According to the White House, the US government currently holds around 200,000 BTC, which was largely obtained through civil and criminal seizures. While the legal path for expanding these reserves is still a bit uncertain, advisers have proposed funding new acquisitions by revaluing gold certificates held by the US Treasury. This would not involve taxpayer funds and would be considered budget-neutral. K33 Aims for 1,000 BTC Norwegian crypto firm K33 announced plans to raise at least 85 million Swedish krona, or roughly $8.9 million, through a directed share issue to fund the purchase of up to 1,000 Bitcoin for its own corporate reserves. The company appointed Pareto Securities to manage the offering, setting the subscription price at $0.011 per share and aiming to issue a minimum of 820 million shares. Announcement from K33 According to K33, the proceeds will be used to buy Bitcoin for its balance sheet, which will help enhance both its financial position and its operational capabilities as a brokerage. The move builds on K33’s earlier step in May when it secured financing to purchase 57 BTC. On Tuesday, the firm confirmed it acquired an initial 5 BTC, valued at approximately $523,000. According to the company, holding Bitcoin will improve its margins, support new product development, and increase its appeal to institutional clients. K33 firmly believes that Bitcoin exposure provides “real operational leverage” for its brokerage business. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen described the fundraising as the first step toward building a strong Bitcoin-based balance sheet, which means that the company is committed to growing its BTC holdings over the long-term. The share offering will not be available in jurisdictions like the United States, Canada, Australia, Russia, or South Korea, among others where such distribution would be prohibited. K33's announcement is part of a broader movement in Norway, where more firms are embracing Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Earlier this month, Norwegian Block Exchange experienced a massive 138% stock surge after revealing plans to hold Bitcoin. Additionally, Aker ASA’s crypto-focused subsidiary, Seetek, now holds 754 BTC . Bitcoin Donation Sparks Political Uproar While Bitcoin mostly attracts feelings of excitement, the same can certainly not be said for everyone. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s government survived its fourth no-confidence vote in three years, this time brought on by a $45 million Bitcoin scandal involving a convicted criminal and the Ministry of Justice. The motion was spearheaded by opposition parties ANO, SPD, and the Pirates, but it failed to reach the necessary 101 votes in Parliament, ending with only 94 supporters after more than 24 hours of debate. Although the Civic Democratic Party remains in power, the controversy surrounding the donation raised many serious questions about the government's handling of crypto-related affairs and its ethical standards. At the center of the scandal is Tomáš Jiřikovský, a man with prior convictions for drug trafficking, weapons offenses, and embezzlement. On May 27, Jiřikovský donated 1,561 Bitcoin — worth approximately 1 billion Czech koruna ($45 million) — to the Ministry of Justice. The donation was made possible after a court authorized the return of his previously seized devices. Jiřikovský claimed the Bitcoin was a third of his crypto holdings, with the remainder — 3,855.15 BTC — tied to the now-defunct illicit website Nucleus Market. Due to outdated hardware, access to the larger wallet has reportedly been lost . The donation triggered a political firestorm that even led to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek on May 30. Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura is also under scrutiny, with opposition members alleging he was aware of the donation in advance. Eva Decroix was sworn in as the new Minister of Justice on June 10 and committed to launching an independent investigation into the matter. She assured the public that her ministry would fully cooperate with authorities. Prime Minister Fiala admitted that the donation could have been prevented and acknowledged that it damaged public trust in his party. He promised accountability for the ethical missteps but accused opposition parties of exploiting the situation to attack his government with “insults and lies,” according to a post he made on X . The incident now adds to a growing list of global political controversies involving cryptocurrency, including US President Donald Trump’s crypto-related ventures and Argentine President Javier Milei’s association with the Libra token scandal. While the Czech government weathered this latest political storm, the long-term implications for its credibility and crypto governance are still uncertain.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9618/trump-ally-joins-prenetics-as-it-buys-187-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Data Shows Short-Term Sellers Losing Steam","Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 4.4% over the past seven days, raising concerns that the top cryptocurrency by market cap may face a sharp price crash amid global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, fresh on-chain data suggests the current dip may be nearing its end. Bitcoin Dip Inching Closer To Its End According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst CryptoGoos, the ongoing Bitcoin dip appears to be losing momentum. The analyst shared the following chart, noting that short-term BTC sellers are “getting exhausted.” The chart illustrates the Bitcoin buy/sell pressure delta, which measures the difference between buying and selling activity on exchanges – typically using order book data or on-chain flows. A positive delta indicates stronger buying interest, while a negative delta suggests higher selling pressure. A visible reduction in the intensity and frequency of red spikes – representing sell pressure – toward the right side of the chart suggests that selling pressure is weakening. At the same time, the increasing presence of green spikes reflects rising dominance of buy orders over sell orders. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto pointed to a potential bullish pennant forming on the daily Bitcoin chart. He noted that the price’s next major move could depend on the upcoming US Federal Reserve’s FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting. Similarly, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader shared a bullish outlook, noting that Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has flipped green on the weekly chart while maintaining its current structure. For the uninitiated, the MACD is a momentum indicator used to spot changes in the strength and direction of a trend in prices. It does this by comparing two moving averages of a price and shows signals when those lines cross, helping traders decide when to buy or sell. BTC Must Defend This Support Level In a separate X post , seasoned analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a critical support level that Bitcoin must hold to avoid a major correction . Citing the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands, Martinez warned that if BTC falls below $102,044, it could drop as low as $82,570. Further, fresh exchange data shows that Bitcoin trading activity has tumbled across all major trading platforms. Notably, BTC trading volumes across leading exchanges recently hit multi-year lows. Despite this, the Puell Multiple suggests that there may still be some room to grow for BTC price. At press time, BTC trades at $104,713, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dip-nearing-end-data-shows-short-term-sellers-losing-steam/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Buy/Sell Pressure Delta|btc|BTCUSDT|bullish pennant|Cryptocurrency|MACD|momentum analysis|on-chain analysis",cryptocompare

XRP XRP, Cardano’s ADA ADA, and Solana’s SOL SOL lost over 1% in the past 24 hours, while dogecoin DOGE is flat on the day but down over 10% for the week, wiping out its early June rally. Ether ETH lost 0.7%, reversing all gains from earlier in the week.

Spot ETH ETFs racked up $19 million in positive flows. U.S. officials are reportedly weighing a direct strike on Iran, while the Federal Reserve flagged a more persistent inflation outlook, spooking investors and pushing equities, crypto majors, and commodities into choppy waters.

Could XRP be gearing up for another breakout? Let’s dive into what he’s saying now. Last year, I shared an XRP prediction that helped many ordinary people become millionaires.

Interest in the token was fading fast. But while sentiment was low, Michael XBT spotted a bullish pattern forming — a 7-year bull pennant, a strong continuation setup in technical analysis. He predicted a major breakout. And he was right. By January 16, 2025, XRP skyrocketed to $3.40, marking a stunning 600% increase from its lows — exactly as he forecasted. XRP Market Today: A Healthy Cooldown? After peaking in January, XRP has entered a consolidation phase. Here’s a look at recent performance: January 2025 : +46% February : -29.3% March : -2.52% April : +4.98% May : -0.80% June (so far) : -0.74% .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Ex-SEC Official Says Judge Torres Already Ended the Ripple Case , Despite recent pullbacks, XRP is holding strong above $2, even after touching $1.60 on April 7. 30-day change : -7.5% 7-day change : -5.3% 24-hour change : -2.8% to $2.17 Michael XBT calls this a “healthy cooldown” before the next big move. XRP Price Forecast: Breakout Like Bitcoin? Michael now believes XRP could be on the verge of another massive breakout — one that could rival Bitcoin’s 8-year trendline breakout. While he hasn’t given a specific price target yet, his confidence is clear. Other analysts expect XRP to reach $5 to $30 during this cycle.

2025-06-19T04:59:43,"Robert Kiyosaki Says Focus on How Much Bitcoin You Own, Not the Price","The post Robert Kiyosaki Says Focus on How Much Bitcoin You Own, Not the Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sharing his thoughts on money, wealth, and how people should approach investing in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin . In a recent post on X, he explained why he doesn’t care much about the Bitcoin price of these assets. What matters more to him is how much he owns. The Wealthy Think Differently Kiyosaki believes that poor and middle-class people tend to focus too much on the price of things. They often worry if an asset is too expensive or if it might drop in value. But according to him, wealthy people think differently. They care more about owning a large quantity of valuable assets, not just watching price charts. He used gold, silver, and Bitcoin as examples. While he admits that price does play a role, he made it clear that his priority is building up how much he owns. He started buying Bitcoin when it was around $6,000 and bought as much as he could. Looking back, he wishes he had even more money at the time to buy more. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FED Rates Remain Unchanged—What Does This Mean for Bitcoin & the Crypto Markets? , Moreover, he has long warned that the U.S. economy is weak and could collapse. He believes it’s being held up by too much debt and what he calls fake money. To protect themselves, he advises people to avoid trusting the system and instead invest in Bitcoin, gold, and silver, not cash or government bonds. Bitcoin to Hit $1M by 2030 Kiyosaki is still very bullish on Bitcoin and believes its price could reach $1 million by the year 2030. His point is that those who own the most Bitcoin will benefit the most in the long run, no matter what the current price is. The focus, he says, should be on growing the amount you hold rather than waiting for the perfect entry price. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, echoed similar views by predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s most optimistic scenario. She explained this would require Bitcoin to grow about 58% each year, driven mainly by more institutions getting involved. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-19T04:49:55,"Over $90M stolen from Iran’s Nobitex exchange burnt by pro-Israel hacker group","After breaching Iran’s largest crypto exchange, the pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande claimed to have destroyed more than $90 million in digital assets taken from Nobitex’s wallets. In a June 18 update via X, the group said it had burned the funds across multiple blockchains using “vanity addresses” that contain no recoverable private keys, effectively rendering the assets permanently inaccessible. This follows the high-profile exploit of Nobitex, in which over $90 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and other tokens were drained from hot wallets. The attackers had originally framed the breach as a direct response to Nobitex’s alleged role in helping the Iranian regime circumvent sanctions and fund terrorism. 12 hours ago 8 burn addresses burned $90M from the wallets of the regime's favorite sanctions violation tool, Nobitex. 12 hours from now The source-code of Nobitex will be open to the public, and Nobitex’s walled garden will be without walls. Where do you want your assets to be?… — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 18, 2025 The group, also known as Predatory Sparrow, tied the hack to ongoing military and cyber tensions between Iran and Israel, which intensified following Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites days earlier. Blockchain security platforms like Chainalysis quickly confirmed that the stolen assets had not been transferred to mixers or exchanges, but rather to irretrievable addresses with inflammatory labels. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran? Some of the addresses included phrases like “FuckIRGCTerroristsNoBiTEX,” targeting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One Bitcoin wallet used in the attack is provably unspendable due to its invalid checksum. On Ethereum, tokens were sent to the “0x…dead” burn address commonly used to retire supply permanently. In response, Nobitex issued a fresh statement acknowledging the burn. The exchange said that user assets are safe in cold storage and that the situation is now under control. Nobitex clarified that as a precaution, its staff had also emptied hot wallets. It reiterated that no customer funds would be lost, citing its reserve fund and insurance pool. Nobitex Announcement No. 4 – Regarding the Security Incident As part of Nobitex’s ongoing response to the recent security incident, we would like to inform our users that the situation is now under control. All external access to our servers has been completely severed. If you… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 18, 2025 The attackers have also threatened to release the source code and internal infrastructure data of Nobitex, which could worsen the situation for Iran’s leading cryptocurrency platform, which has over 11 million users. Gonjeshke Darande warned that any assets left on the platform would be at risk if users did not withdraw immediately. Despite having no financial motivation, the hack has far-reaching implications. The intentional destruction of more than $90 million worth of digital currency demonstrates how state-level conflicts have turned crypto infrastructure into a new battlefield.

The price is now consolidating losses and might recover unless the bears push it below $2.120. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.180 zone. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.1550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a recovery wave if there is a close above the $2.20 resistance zone. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price reacted to the downside below the $2.220 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.20 and $2.180 support levels. The pair tested the $2.120 support A low was formed at $2.120 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.335 swing high to the $2.120 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.1550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.180 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.20 level. The next resistance is $2.2250 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.335 swing high to the $2.120 low. A clear move above the $2.2250 resistance might send the price toward the $2.2540 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.280 resistance or even $2.30 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.350. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.1420 level. The next major support is near the $2.120 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.120 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone.

2025-06-19T03:37:25,"Binance, OKX Set Transparency Standard with PoR Reports as Coinbase Lags: CQ","A new report by CryptoQuant ranks the transparency of five major crypto exchanges based on their proof-of-reserves (PoR) practices. The analysis revealed that Binance is leading, while other players like Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase are trailing. The PoR Rankings The survey evaluated each exchange’s reserve ratio, a metric calculated by dividing the net customer balance by the platform’s total balance. Binance ranked first in transparency, consistently maintaining a coverage level above 100% and releasing its PoR reports on a monthly and timely basis. OKX followed closely behind, also reporting a capital backing rate that remains above 100%. However, the figure is slightly below Binance’s. The exchange also publishes its disclosures monthly and without delay. Bybit came in next on the list, with a reserve ratio ranging between 105% and 115%. The platform recently improved its disclosure practices by shifting from bi-monthly to monthly reporting. CryptoQuant gave Kraken the fourth spot, with the exchange maintaining backing figures above 100%. However, it has only published four reports since November 22, 2022, with CQ’s analysis highlighting the need for more regular updates. Coinbase is ranked last, as the exchange has not published any PoR report. Analyst Maartun described this trend as a major shortcoming, especially given the company’s size and market position. Coinbase Fails to Reveal Reserves The CryptoQuant quick take noted that Binance and OKX are currently setting the industry standard due to their strong reserve coverage and consistent, on-time reporting. Despite a few gaps that need to be filled, Bybit and Kraken are also making progress. However, Coinbase stood out as the only exchange among the five reviewed that has yet to offer any PoR data. Proof-of-reserves is a method used by crypto exchanges to show that they hold enough digital assets to cover customer deposits. The transparency measure became popular among institutions after big crypto platforms like FTX and Mt. Gox collapsed, leaving investors unsure whether their funds were safe. Despite growing adoption, the practice has also been criticized by some notable crypto industry figures. Strategy’s Michael Saylor recently called it a “ bad idea .” He argued that disclosing wallet addresses, often part of the PoR process, introduces serious security risks. According to the Bitcoin enthusiast, no professional security team would recommend making wallet structures public. He further claimed that if AI were asked to evaluate the risks posed by the practice, it would produce 50 pages of potential threats.

2025-06-19T03:25:13,"Who's Selling Bitcoin Above $100K and Holding Back the Price Rally?","Bitcoin's BTC bull market has stalled, and how. Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows , stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000. It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100K mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation ? According to Alexander Blume, managing partner at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors. ""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups."" Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total. The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits. ""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Thursday. Miners offload BTC Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock . The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days. ""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told CoinDesk. Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022. Accumulation stalls for next-best alternatives Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures. ""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Benjamin Lilly, founder of Jarvis Labs, noted. The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility. Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets. ""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk. What next? According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment. ""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted. Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter. ""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said. According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/19/who-s-been-selling-bitcoin-above-usd100k-and-holding-back-the-price-rally,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare
