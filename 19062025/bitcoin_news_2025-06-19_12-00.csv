2025-06-19T09:58:07,"It's Bull Time for Bitcoin (BTC) and Gold, Bear Time for Fiat Currency! Bitwise Explains Why!","The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has seen a huge increase in institutional adoption in recent months. While many companies are buying Bitcoin at this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin hoarding race. Related News: Huge BTC Move Comes From The Company That Consults The Person Who Convinced Donald Trump About Bitcoin! While the increase in institutional adoption is notable, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan spoke about the demand for BTC. Matt Hougan argued that investors globally are now questioning the future of the fiat currency system and have begun to turn to Bitcoin and gold as safe havens. Hougan said he believes the world is beginning to question the very foundations of the fiat currency system that has defined the modern economy since the early 1970s. Stating that the fiat currency system is no longer stable and secure at this point, Hougan said that central banks are turning to gold to protect against currency depreciation, while investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a digital alternative. The Bitwise CIO said that central banks, which were routine buyers of gold before 1971, abandoned the gold narrative and entered a period of unlimited money printing, but started buying gold again after the 2008 financial crisis due to growing concerns about fiat money. Pointing out that Bitcoin purchases with gold have also increased recently, Hougan said that a total of $45 billion has been invested in Bitcoin ETFs as of January 2024, while only $34 billion has been invested in gold ETFs in the same period. At this point, Hougan added, traditional portfolio strategies are now risky. Finally, Hougan noted that Bitcoin will emerge as a modern store of value as inflation concerns rise and trust in government-issued currencies decline, further reinforcing the need for investors to include alternatives like Bitcoin and gold in their portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

Together, the posts have added fresh fuel to the Bitcoin conversation, drawing in both long-time believers and curious onlookers. Here’s what’s behind the latest Bitcoin buzz. Max Keiser’s ‘Satoshi’ Post Sparks Crypto Reactions Max Keiser, well-known Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, shared a cryptic post on X. It featured a GIF of a hooded figure kneeling before a sword embedded in stone – strongly resembling the legend of King Arthur and Excalibur. The post carried just one word: “Satoshi.” The tweet quickly grabbed attention. Some users called Satoshi Nakamoto a “deity,” while others took the image as a symbol of Bitcoin’s role in challenging a broken financial system. Satoshi pic.twitter.com/qezco1kjRF — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 18, 2025 One user wrote: “He created Excalibur, which, like Bitcoin, conquers the monetary establishment.” Whether a tribute to Bitcoin’s creator or a deeper message, the tweet added another layer to the ongoing mystery around Satoshi Nakamoto and sparked a wave of discussion. Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million Adding more to this, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki made a shocking prediction: Bitcoin could be trading at $1 million per coin by 2030. PRICE vs QUANTITY Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity. I do not care much about the spot price of gold or silver. I do care about how many ounces of gold and silver I control. The same with Bitcoin. While I watch the price of Bitcoin I focus on how many… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 18, 2025 Kiyosaki said he started buying Bitcoin when it was just $6,000 and continues to stack it. He emphasized that it’s not about the current price – it’s about how much Bitcoin, gold, and silver you own. In another tweet, he pointed to his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy , where he warned of a major financial crash. He believes that collapse is now happening. With AI threatening jobs and many retirees seeing their savings wiped out, Kiyosaki’s advice is simple: “Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Back in the Spotlight Keiser’s eerie GIF and Kiyosaki’s bold forecast have once again pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight – this time as both a cultural symbol and a hedge against economic chaos.

2025-06-19T09:50:30,"Geopolitical Risk: Looming Middle East Tensions Could Trigger Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Looming Middle East Tensions Could Trigger Crypto Market Impact The world of finance, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market, is often a reflection of global events. When tensions rise in critical regions, investors pay close attention. Recent reports citing foreign media via Odaily suggest the U.S. is considering a significant military action: a strike on Iran, potentially targeting the Fordow nuclear facility, as early as this weekend. This development introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into an already complex global landscape. Understanding the Source of `Middle East Tensions` What exactly is fueling these concerns? The reports stem from foreign media outlets, relayed by Odaily, indicating a potential U.S. military response targeting Iran. While specifics remain fluid and official confirmation is awaited, the focus on a key nuclear site like Fordow underscores the gravity of the situation. The Middle East has long been a region prone to volatility, and any direct military confrontation between major powers like the U.S. and Iran would represent a significant escalation of existing Middle East Tensions . This isn’t just about two countries; the implications ripple outwards, affecting international relations, energy markets, and global finance. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core elements based on the report: The Report: U.S. reportedly considering a strike on Iran. Potential Timing: As early as this weekend. Primary Target (Reported): Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility. Source: Foreign media reports, cited by Odaily. It’s crucial to remember that these are reports and considerations, not confirmed plans. However, the mere possibility is enough to inject uncertainty into markets. Why Does `Geopolitical Risk` Matter for Markets? Geopolitical events, especially those involving potential conflict in strategically important regions, have a profound impact on financial markets. Why? Because they create uncertainty. Investors dislike uncertainty. They struggle to price in outcomes when the future is suddenly unpredictable. Geopolitical Risk can manifest in several ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can disrupt trade routes, energy supplies, and production, leading to price hikes and shortages. Increased Government Spending & Debt: Military actions require significant resources, potentially leading to increased national debt and inflationary pressures. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Fear and panic can lead to rapid sell-offs in perceived risky assets and a flight to safety. Sanctions and Economic Warfare: Governments may impose sanctions, impacting international trade and financial flows. Historically, major geopolitical events have often triggered periods of intense market volatility. Think back to events like the start of conflicts, major political crises, or terrorist attacks. While the long-term impact varies, the immediate reaction is almost always one of heightened caution and price swings. Direct `Crypto Market Impact`: How Could a Strike Affect Digital Assets? While the crypto market operates differently from traditional markets, it is not immune to global events. The potential for a U.S. strike on Iran and the resulting escalation of Middle East Tensions could have a notable Crypto Market Impact . Here’s how: Sentiment Shift: Global fear and uncertainty often lead investors to reduce exposure to assets perceived as high-risk, which cryptocurrencies sometimes are, despite arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven. Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell crypto assets to raise cash or cover losses in other markets. Safe Haven Narrative Test: Some argue Bitcoin is a digital safe haven akin to gold. Geopolitical crises test this narrative. Demand for Bitcoin *could* increase if investors truly see it as uncorrelated to traditional risks, but it could also fall if the overall risk-off sentiment dominates. Increased Use in Sanctioned Regions: Paradoxically, increased sanctions against Iran or other involved parties could potentially increase the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, though this is a complex and often debated topic with regulatory implications. The immediate Crypto Market Impact is likely to be negative volatility driven by fear, followed by a period where the ‘safe haven’ narrative is either reinforced or weakened depending on how investors react globally. Will This Impact `Bitcoin Price`? As the leading cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Price is often the primary indicator of the broader market’s reaction to macroeconomic and geopolitical events. A potential U.S. strike on Iran is highly likely to impact the Bitcoin Price , at least in the short term. Here are potential scenarios for the Bitcoin Price : Scenario Potential Bitcoin Price Reaction Reasoning Immediate Escalation & Fear Sharp Decline Risk-off sentiment dominates; investors sell perceived risky assets. Conflict Contained / De-escalation Recovery / Stabilisation Uncertainty decreases; market focuses on other factors. Protracted Conflict / Broad Instability Mixed / Potential Long-Term Decline Sustained global economic uncertainty outweighs specific crypto narratives. Bitcoin as Safe Haven (Strong Adoption) Potential Increase Investors flock to Bitcoin as an alternative asset uncorrelated to traditional markets (less likely for immediate, sharp conflict). In most immediate conflict scenarios, initial reactions tend towards risk aversion, which historically has put downward pressure on Bitcoin Price . However, the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ means that sustained geopolitical instability *could* eventually drive demand if traditional safe havens are perceived as insufficient or if confidence in fiat currencies wavers. The key challenge is the unpredictable nature of both the geopolitical event and the market’s reaction. Navigating `Financial Market Volatility`: Strategies for Crypto Investors Given the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility stemming from rising Middle East Tensions and broader Geopolitical Risk , what can crypto investors do? While no strategy guarantees protection, here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much potential loss you can withstand. Geopolitical events can cause significant, rapid price swings. Reduce Leverage: Highly leveraged positions are extremely vulnerable to sudden volatility. Consider reducing or closing leveraged trades. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset. While crypto may react in tandem, diversification across different asset classes (including traditional ones, if appropriate for you) can help mitigate overall portfolio risk. Have a Plan: Decide in advance how you will react to different market movements. Will you sell, hold, or buy the dip? Stick to your plan rather than making impulsive decisions based on fear. Stay Informed (Critically): Follow reliable news sources but be wary of sensationalism. Understand the potential implications without panicking. Consider Stablecoins: Moving a portion of your portfolio into stablecoins can preserve capital during periods of extreme volatility, allowing you to re-enter the market later. Managing Financial Market Volatility requires discipline and a long-term perspective. Short-term reactions to geopolitical news can be severe, but markets often recover or adjust over time. Beyond the Headlines: Long-Term Implications Should the reported potential strike occur, or should Middle East Tensions escalate significantly, the long-term implications for the global economy and financial markets could be substantial. This includes potential shifts in global alliances, increased defense spending, sustained energy price volatility, and potentially accelerated adoption of alternative financial systems if confidence in traditional ones is shaken. The Crypto Market Impact in such a scenario would evolve beyond immediate price reactions, potentially influencing regulatory approaches, institutional adoption timelines, and the perceived utility of cryptocurrencies in a more fragmented or unstable world. While the immediate focus is on the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility and its effect on Bitcoin Price due to rising Geopolitical Risk , smart investors will also consider how these events might shape the landscape for digital assets in the years to come. Compelling Summary Reports suggesting a potential U.S. strike on Iran this weekend have introduced a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk and heightened Middle East Tensions . Such events are notorious triggers for Financial Market Volatility across the board, and the cryptocurrency market, including the Bitcoin Price , is unlikely to be spared. While the ultimate Crypto Market Impact remains uncertain and depends heavily on the scope and duration of any conflict, investors should prepare for potential turbulence. Understanding the risks, having a clear strategy, and avoiding impulsive reactions are crucial steps for navigating these uncertain times. Geopolitical events underscore the interconnectedness of global finance and the importance of risk management in the volatile world of digital assets.

""What They're Doing Is Dangerous, It Will Eventually Hurt Bitcoin!""","Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, one of the vocal advocates of Bitcoin, made new statements. Accordingly, Anthony Scaramucci criticized companies issuing debt instruments to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) for their corporate treasuries. The famous CEO warned that this strategy would become obsolete, describing it as a risky trend that could harm Bitcoin. “This is Risky, Bitcoin Will Suffer Damage!” Speaking at the DigiAssets 2025 conference, Scaramucci argued that it was dangerous for companies to start buying Bitcoin in the style of Michael Saylor's company MicroStrategy (Strategy). “I don’t think it’s right for companies to buy BTC by issuing debt for their corporate reserves. But this happens all the time in our industry and it feels like SPACs. “I'm worried that this could eventually create a rift and hurt Bitcoin.” While borrowing money to buy Bitcoin is currently the most popular thing to do, “it will become obsolete and it will hurt Bitcoin,” Scaramcci said. We Think Differently with Michael Saylor! While the views that Bitcoin is digital gold are increasing day by day, Scaramucci said that he is among those who think that Bitcoin is digital gold. Stating that he thinks differently from Michael Saylor on this point, Scaramucci said that Saylor sees Bitcoin as digital property. At this point, although Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Saylor are optimistic about the Bitcoin price, Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin is “digital gold”; Saylor believes that Bitcoin is a “digital asset” with a potential value of $5 trillion. “For me, Bitcoin is digital gold and that is why I think it will be traded according to market value of gold. “If Michael Saylor was here, he would say, 'No, this is digital property, it's going to be tied to the rest of the world's property.' He thinks Bitcoin will be a $500 trillion asset. I think it's going to be a $24 or $25 trillion asset.” While Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin purchases have been closely monitored by the market, analysts at The Kobeissi Letter noted that a forced liquidation scenario for Strategy due to its BTC purchases is very unlikely. However, they added that there is a small risk of liquidation. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Famous CEO's Much-Talked-About Bitcoin (BTC) Criticism!

2025-06-19T09:27:55,"Trump slams Powell’s rate stance as BTC price flatlines","President Trump slams Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates, leaving America’s monetary policy unchanged again. As a result, Bitcoin has seen minimal price movement ever since. In a recent post shared to Trump Media & Technology Group-owned social media platform Truth Social, President Donald Trump did not hold back from harshly criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s unwavering stance towards interest rates. “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!” wrote Trump in his post . Not only that, he also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site , which quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator who called for the Federal Reserve Chairman to quit if he continues to maintain the current interest rate. Although the decision to keep the interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% range, it has left Bitcoin ( BTC ) at a standstill. Ever since it was announced that the Fed unanimously voted to maintain its current policy in June, Bitcoin has been stuck around the $104,000 floating around the mark, seeing weak gains of only 0.28% to as low as 0.1%. It appears that the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s previous rally, much to the dismay of traders and the President of the U.S. himself. In the past two weeks, the largest cryptocurrency has seen a slight increase of 0.3%.

On June 18, the Federal Reserve came to a unanimous decision to maintain a “wait-and-see” approach to the current monetary stance in June. According to a CNBC report , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference that policymakers are “well positioned to wait” before moving further on rates. He also said that the market is beginning to see the effects of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be,” said Jerome Powell, as quoted by CNN Business from the press conference. “I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects,” he continued. Maintaining interest rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% is considered restrictive by many, considering that it led to a fall in investor confidence. Moreover, Bloomberg reported that the Fed has also revised its economic growth forecast, showing a decline for 2025. Lower GDP projections could suggest less consumer spending, weaker investment, or global headwinds. The inflation forecast for 2025 has been raised to 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target. This signals that inflationary pressures may be more persistent than previously expected. After the Fed refused to cut interest rates and foreshadowed a bleaker economic outlook, the U.S. stocks took a dive. You might also like: Here’s how the crypto market reacted to the Fed’s 0.25% cut According to a report by Reuters , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.10% compared to the previous day. Meanwhile the S&P saw a decline of 0.03%. In contrast to the two exchanges, the Nasdaq Composite actually rose by 0.13%. However, overall stock prices were generally higher before the Fed’s announcement. On the crypto side of the market, the overall crypto market cap fell by 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The current crypto market cap stands at $3.3 trillion, after major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) saw declines ranging from 1.6% to 0.2%. Even the overall crypto trading volume suffered a 15% fall following the Fed announcement, from an initial $120 billion to $101 billion on June 19. Additionally, the CBS reported that the central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months. It also foresaw two interest rate cuts by the end of this year. This prediction is the same as its previous projection back in March. “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” said Jerome Powell. The Fed’s decision goes against increasing pressures from the White House to lower interest rated by two points. Just hours before the announcement, Trump said that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of his ongoing attacks on the Fed.

2025-06-19T09:25:42,"Bitcoin Battles for $105K Following Fed’s Decision, Altcoins Stagnate (Market Watch)","The decision regarding the general interest rates in the United States came in yesterday and the Federal Reserve didn’t really surprise the market. Bitcoin continues fighting for $105,000, going through some very moderate volatility in the interim, all the while altcoins are also stagnating. The Fed did note some changes in its economic outlook, though, so let’s take a closer look at the events that transpired throughout the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Battles for $105,000 At the time of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at around $104,800, marking a very slight increase of around 0.2% on the daily chart seen below. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency had declined to around $103,600 but the bulls were quick to intercept the move and pushed the price back towards $105K. This comes immediately after the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the general interest rates unchanged in the range between 4.25% and 4.5%. This is what the majority of the traders were expecting. In fact, according to Polymarket, there was less than 1% chance for the institution to go with a 25bps cut. Nonetheless, the FOMC update also included a few additional remarks, which do mark a slight change of tone. Most notably: Ups inflation forecast to 3% Cuts 2025 GDP forecast to 1.4% Sees 50bps in cuts this year Rates projected at 3.6% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027 At the same time, president Donald Trump continues with his hostile rhetoric towards Fed Chairman Powell, calling him “stupid,” and insisting that the country is losing billions of dollars because of the institutions refusal to cut rates. The political pressure seems to be mounting. Altcoins Stagnate Perhaps somewhat expectedly, the altcoins market is also stagnating and failed to chart any notable moves throughout the past 24 hours. As you can see in the heatmap below, most of the alternative cryptocurrencies are trading at more or less breakeven, with a few notable exceptions, of course. For example, Uniswap’s native token – UNI – managed to increase by more than 5%, defying the market slowdown, as well as OKB, which is up by almost 8%. On the other hand, Hyperliquid’s HYPE continues crashing and is down another 7% in the past 24 hours, currently trading below $38.

Soon after this post, Bitcoin dropped quickly from $108,952 to $103,371 before bouncing back slightly to $104,950 . Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, also fell. Ether lost 1.5%, dropping from $2,618 to $2,462 before recovering to $2,526. Meanwhile, Solana and XRP dropped over 2% in 24 hours. However, Cardano, SUI, and Dogecoin saw even bigger losses of over 10% to 12% for the week. Fed’s Warning Adds More Caution On top of geopolitical worries, the U.S. Federal Reserve added more concerns . Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that global conflict and new tariffs could make inflation worse. Although interest rates stayed the same, Powell made it clear that the Fed isn’t ready to lower them yet. Bitcoin Stuck Between Roles As tensions rose, many investors shifted their funds into stablecoins or held on to Bitcoin, viewing them as safer compared to altcoins. Despite this, BTC hasn’t acted fully like a safe-haven asset like gold, nor has it rallied like risk assets. While Bitcoin is up 60% in the last 1 year, analysts say it’s still unclear which direction it’ll take next. Crypto expert Doctor Profit warns that BTC could dip below $100,000 soon, possibly even to $93,000, as markets brace for more macro shocks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/middle-east-tensions-hit-crypto-market-altcoins-hit-hardest/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL","News",cryptocompare

According to the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) , the media and PR relations wing of the Pakistan armed forces, both the heads discussed economic development and crypto. “Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR noted. Trump Has Personal Interest in Crypto Talks The luncheon meeting took place amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran, with Trump looking for a possible US involvement. According to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, Trump takes a “deep personal interest” in talking crypto. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, and Counter Terrorism.” Further, diplomatic sources in Washington noted that the meeting wasn’t arranged through routine diplomatic channels. Pakistan’s daily, Dawn, reported that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation and engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, helped Pakistan secure the meeting with Trump. Meanwhile, Trump also praised both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Army chief for their roles in reducing and de-escalating tensions between India-Pakistan in May. “Prime Minister Modi just left a little while ago and we are working a trade deal with India and also with Pakistan,” Trump noted. “I am so happy. Two very smart people decided not to keep going with the war. Those are two big nuclear powers.” Pakistan’s Crypto Ambition Rises Pakistan has been mulling over several crypto advancements, including a plan to set up a Bitcoin reserve. The country’s Crypto Council noted that Bitcoin will be held and Pakistan will “ never sell them .” Interestingly, in April, Pakistan partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF) , a company linked to the US President Donald Trump’s family. Per the agreement, the collaboration will explore asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. However, details of the deal remain vague. Crypto is already widely popular in Pakistan, with around 20 million users , placing it among the top nations in crypto trading. Additionally, global crypto exchange platforms like Binance are showing interest, as Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and AI data centres. Hussain Nadeem, a policy strategist and Pakistani AI expert, said last month that Pakistan’s core interest in crypto is to gain access to the White House. “The regime has only ONE interest in Crypto: Access to Trump White House, and sadly this hype is all about that, nothing more.” Crypto is the new SIFC: The way this regime is approaching Crypto, it has unfortunately become a yet new con that has politics, not public good, as an end goal.

In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hayes says that between now and 2028, liquidity in the “realm of $9 trillion” will be injected into the US economy, initially flowing into the traditional economic sectors before trickling down to risk assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). “…And I think the banks are going to free, because they now don’t have to hold all this equity capital against their treasury book, they can lend more into the real American economy. And so you’re going to see the amount of loans going to manufacturing firms increase, which is again… that’s an increase in credit. And that will make its way into crypto as well.” The BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin could skyrocket by around 139% from the current price by the end of the year. By 2028, Hayes Bitcoin could go up nearly tenfold. “So I think that we get to $250,000 by the end of the year. It will be bumpy along the way, obviously. But that’s sort of my end-of-year price target. And then a $1 million Bitcoin.” On why Bitcoin could outperform other risk assets amid the expected injection of liquidity, Hayes says, “So Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It’s obviously a much smaller market in terms of market cap. And so you have a lot of things chasing a very small door, then the price goes up on the margin. And so that’s why Bitcoin has been the best performing financial asset in the last 15 years.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,462 at time of writing. ?

2025-06-19T09:00:29,"TRON Price Dips, But On-Chain Growth Tells a Different Story","TRON (TRX) has entered a period of downward price movement, with the asset declining steadily over recent weeks. At the time of reporting, TRX is trading at $0.2683, representing a 4% drop in the past 24 hours and nearly 10% over the past week. The current trend marks a continued break from the relatively stable price range TRON held earlier this quarter. Despite the market downturn, on-chain indicators suggest TRON’s ecosystem is still exhibiting growth in user activity and operational strength. This contrast between price performance and network fundamentals has drawn attention from analysts, including CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, who recently shared detailed insights on TRON’s blockchain dynamics via the platform’s QuickTake platform Transaction Metrics Show Long-Term Network Reliability According to Darkfost, TRON’s blockchain has seen consistent growth in daily transaction volume since 2021. From a baseline of around 2.5 million transactions per day, the figure has risen to over 9 million transactions as of recent data, signaling an increase in overall usage. Importantly, the transaction success rate has remained above 96% during this period, suggesting that the higher volume is not being driven by failed or spam-related activity, an issue that has surfaced in critiques of other high-throughput blockchains. The consistency extends to the network’s block production. Despite the uptick in transaction count, TRON has maintained a nearly linear block output over time. This indicates that the network infrastructure is able to handle increased demand without disruption, offering insights into its stability as a decentralized system. Furthermore, even in the face of higher global transaction fees, activity on the network has not declined, implying continued demand for TRON’s block space and throughput capacity. Speculation Aside, On-Chain Data Suggests Operational Strength In addition to its transactional metrics, TRX’s on-chain indicators continue to show resilience . Darkfost points out that while recent speculation around external associations, such as news involving Eric Trump or a potential Nasdaq listing , has captured headlines, the objective blockchain data is a more accurate measure of network health. Metrics like transaction success rate, throughput stability, and block production suggest that the network is functioning efficiently even in uncertain market conditions. This performance has continued amid broader developments in the TRON ecosystem, including the expansion of its DeFi services and integration of its USDT issuance platform. Despite the current price trend, these signals may play a role in shaping investor sentiment if the broader market environment stabilizes. For now, TRON’s core infrastructure appears to be scaling reliably in the background, even as its token faces downward pressure.

However, some market watchers believe that the altcoin is preparing for new highs despite the recent pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For ‘Large Move’ Amid $103,000 Retest – Key Levels To Watch SUI Eyes Breakout To $5 This week, SUI fell below the $3.00 mark amid the Israel-Iran news-fueled market retrace. The cryptocurrency has seen a 7% decline over the past three days, hitting a two-month low of $2.68 on Wednesday morning before recovering. Since its late April breakout, SUI has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range, with the price hovering around the upper boundary over the past two months. Notably, the altcoin ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March, leading to its rally to the $4.00 mark. On Wednesday, analyst Crypto Bullet suggested that it could be preparing for a similar performance. According to the post, SUI broke down a falling wedge pattern before bouncing off the yearly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average (MA) between March and April, which propelled the downtrend breakout and rally to its May high. Now, the cryptocurrency is testing the EMA and MA again, while printing a new falling wedge pattern that targets the $5.00-$5.50 area. To Crypto Bullet, “This is where SUI is gonna establish a Higher Low and soon rise to a New ATH.” Earlier this month, the analyst also highlighted a one-year rising wedge pattern that eyes the $8-$10 levels as the next major target for the cryptocurrency. The high-timeframe chart shows the altcoin has been hovering between the pattern’s upper and lower boundaries since early 2024. Amid its April price action, the cryptocurrency bounced from the pattern’s support, suggesting that a surge to the resistance line will come in the coming months if history repeats. Make-Or-Break Level Retest Meanwhile, trader Coinvo noted that SUI is currently retesting a make-or-break level, the key $2.80 area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year. Holding this level is crucial for the cryptocurrency’s rally, as a drop could send the price toward the $2.33 range low and risk a potential retest of the $2.00 support. On the contrary, price stability in this area could propel a reclaim of the $3.00 barrier and a recovery of the range highs, which is necessary for a bullish rally continuation. As analyst Rekt Capital previously warned, June’s performance will be decisive for its mid-term action. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels – $2,100 Or $4,000 Next? It’s worth noting that SUI has built a re-accumulation range around the same levels as it did in late 2024. At the time, it consolidated around the $3.39-$3.78 levels for weeks before Weekly Closing above the range and setting up for its all-time high (ATH) breakout. This time, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating less cleanly than last year, failing to secure a weekly close inside the range for two consecutive weeks. SUI must reclaim the $3.39 area in the coming weeks to maintain its Monthly Bull Flag and position itself for higher levels. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.79, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-19T08:50:22,"Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury Imagine a digital asset, born from the world of Cryptocurrency , that doesn’t just coexist with traditional finance but actively works to strengthen the bedrock of the global economy – the US Dollar . This isn’t a far-fetched concept; it’s a perspective recently highlighted by a key figure in U.S. financial policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that Stablecoins could play a significant role in reinforcing the US Dollar ’s global supremacy, primarily by becoming substantial buyers of US Treasury assets. This view from such a high-level official underscores the evolving perception of digital assets within traditional financial corridors and their potential impact on global Financial Stability . Why Does the US Treasury See Value in Stablecoins? The statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as reported by The Block, is noteworthy because it comes from an institution historically cautious about the volatile nature of Cryptocurrency . His perspective centers on a specific, often overlooked, aspect of certain Stablecoins : their reserve holdings. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US Dollar . To maintain this peg, issuers hold reserves. For the most popular dollar-pegged Stablecoins , these reserves often include highly liquid, low-risk assets – and U.S. Treasurys are a prime example. The logic is straightforward: as the market capitalization of dollar-pegged Stablecoins grows, the demand for the assets held in their reserves also increases. If a significant portion of these reserves is held in US Treasury securities, then the growth of the Stablecoin market translates directly into increased demand for U.S. government debt. This increased demand has several potential benefits for the US Treasury and the broader U.S. economy. Stablecoins and the US Dollar: A Digital Alliance? The US Dollar has long held the position of the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. This dominance provides significant economic and geopolitical advantages to the United States. In a rapidly digitizing global economy, maintaining this position requires the dollar to be easily accessible and usable in digital forms. While discussions around a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) continue, Stablecoins offer an existing, market-driven solution for digital dollar transactions. Here’s how Stablecoins can potentially strengthen the US Dollar ‘s global position: Increased Demand for Dollar-Denominated Assets: As mentioned, the reserve requirements of dollar-pegged Stablecoins create direct demand for dollar-denominated assets, including US Treasury securities. This reinforces the dollar’s status as a store of value. Enhanced Digital Accessibility: Stablecoins facilitate faster, cheaper, and more programmable transactions globally compared to traditional cross-border payment systems. This makes the digital dollar more attractive and easier to use for international commerce and remittances, potentially extending the dollar’s reach in new markets and digital economies. Alternative to Foreign Currencies in Digital Trade: In the absence of easy access to digital dollars via Stablecoins , users in digital ecosystems might opt for other currencies or assets. The availability of reliable dollar-pegged Stablecoins ensures the dollar remains the preferred medium of exchange in these growing digital spaces. Innovation Hub: The innovation spurred by the Stablecoin market within the U.S. regulatory framework (or proposed frameworks) can help maintain the U.S. as a leader in financial technology, further solidifying the dollar’s role. Secretary Bessent’s focus on US Treasury purchases highlights a tangible mechanism through which Stablecoins can provide direct economic benefit to the U.S. government by supporting its debt market. This is a different angle than just facilitating payments; it speaks to the underlying financial infrastructure that supports the dollar’s strength. Impact on the US Treasury and Financial Stability The sheer scale of the Stablecoin market means their reserve holdings are becoming increasingly significant. Major dollar-pegged Stablecoins represent tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization, and a substantial portion of this is held in assets like commercial paper, bank deposits, and critically, US Treasury bills and notes. Consider the implications for the US Treasury : New Source of Demand: As the Stablecoin market grows, it introduces a new, potentially large, and consistent buyer base for U.S. government debt. This diversification of buyers can be beneficial for market stability. Potential Impact on Borrowing Costs: Increased demand for Treasurys generally leads to higher prices for those securities, which translates to lower yields (interest rates) for the government when it borrows money. If Stablecoins become significant buyers, they could help keep U.S. borrowing costs lower than they otherwise might be. Reinforcing Market Depth and Liquidity: Large, active buyers contribute to the overall depth and liquidity of the US Treasury market, making it easier for the U.S. government to issue debt and for investors to trade it. This is crucial for maintaining Financial Stability . The idea that a technology born from the volatile world of Cryptocurrency could become a pillar of support for the highly traditional US Treasury market is a powerful testament to the potential for convergence between these two worlds. It underscores the need for policymakers to understand these new dynamics rather than simply viewing Cryptocurrency through a lens of risk. Stablecoins, Cryptocurrency, and the Path Forward Secretary Bessent’s comments signal a growing recognition within government that certain aspects of Cryptocurrency , specifically well-regulated and transparent Stablecoins , could be integrated into the existing financial system in beneficial ways. This perspective is vital for fostering a productive dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry. However, this potential doesn’t come without challenges. For Stablecoins to truly contribute to Financial Stability and strengthen the US Dollar and US Treasury , several key areas need attention: Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Clarity: A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for Stablecoins is essential. This includes rules around reserve requirements, auditing, redemption rights, and overall risk management to prevent failures that could harm users and potentially spill over into traditional markets. Reserve Management Risks: The quality and management of Stablecoin reserves are paramount. Lack of transparency or holding risky assets could undermine confidence and pose systemic risks if the market grows large enough. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that users understand the risks associated with Stablecoins and have adequate protections is crucial for building trust and encouraging adoption. Interoperability: Developing standards for how Stablecoins interact with traditional payment systems and other digital asset platforms will be key to their widespread utility. The conversation initiated by figures like Secretary Bessent moves beyond simply debating the merits of Bitcoin or the volatility of the broader Cryptocurrency market. It focuses on the specific utility and potential economic benefits that a particular class of digital asset – Stablecoins – can offer to the established financial order. This nuanced view is critical for developing regulation that fosters innovation while managing risk. Actionable Insights from the Treasury’s View What does this perspective from the U.S. Treasury mean for different stakeholders? For Policymakers: It reinforces the urgency of developing tailored, risk-based regulation for Stablecoins that acknowledges their potential benefits while mitigating risks. Collaboration with international bodies is also key to ensure global consistency. For the Cryptocurrency Industry: It highlights the importance of building transparent, well-managed Stablecoin projects that can demonstrate their safety and soundness to regulators and the public. Engaging constructively with policymakers is vital. For Investors and Users: It underscores the growing intersection between traditional finance and Cryptocurrency . Understanding how assets like Stablecoins fit into the broader financial ecosystem, including their role in reserve markets like US Treasury , is increasingly important. It also emphasizes the need to choose Stablecoins from reputable issuers with clear reserve policies. For Traditional Financial Institutions: It signals potential opportunities for collaboration and integration, particularly in areas like digital payments, asset tokenization, and participation in digital asset markets. The Secretary’s comments suggest a future where Stablecoins are not just tolerated but potentially embraced as tools that can enhance the existing financial infrastructure and reinforce the global standing of the US Dollar . This requires careful navigation of the regulatory landscape and continued innovation in building secure and reliable digital asset systems. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Stablecoins and the Dollar U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s view that Stablecoins can strengthen the US Dollar ’s global dominance by boosting demand for US Treasury assets marks a significant moment in the dialogue between government and the digital asset world. It shifts the focus from the speculative aspects of Cryptocurrency to the potential utility and economic benefits of Stablecoins as a digital form of the dollar and a new source of demand for U.S. government debt. While challenges related to regulation, risk management, and consumer protection remain, the recognition from a high-level official like Secretary Bessent highlights the potential for Stablecoins to become an integrated part of the global financial architecture, reinforcing the US Dollar ‘s position and contributing to overall Financial Stability . The path forward requires careful consideration, collaboration, and a commitment to building robust and transparent systems that can harness the power of digital innovation for the benefit of the traditional economy.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) cut its interest rate to zero on Thursday, to counter falling inflation, appreciating Swiss franc (CHF) and economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s trade war. The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China. The latest rate cut is bank’s sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024. The SNB’s return to zero may be a sign of things to come across Europe and other advanced nations.

""I Want It On My Desk ASAP!""","In the USA, the cryptocurrency-friendly stablecoin law GENIUS Act received approval from the Senate after long efforts. At this point, there is one last stage left for GENIUS, which US President Donald Trump plans to approve by August. The GENIUS law must also receive approval from the House of Representatives before it can be signed by Trump. Now, as all eyes turn to the House of Representatives, a new statement came from Donald Trump. Accordingly, Trump, in his post on his Truth Social account, asked the House of Representatives to move quickly for the final signature of the GENIUS Act and urged it to pass as soon as possible. Trump stated that the Senate passed an incredible bill that would make the United States the undisputed leader in the field of digital assets. Describing the bill as pure genius, Trump said GENIIUS would bring major investments and major innovations to the United States. “….There will be no country that can do better than this. (This bill) is truly a genius idea. Get this to my desk now — NO DELAY, NO ADD-ON. With this I will show the world how to earn with digital assets like never before.” The GENIUS law imposes strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compulsory licensing, full reserve support, annual audits for issuers with a market value of over $50 billion, and regulatory oversight by foreign entities. The stablecoin bill GENIUS passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote and now awaits a vote in the House of Representatives. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T08:40:17,"Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Why the Crypto Market is in Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Why the Crypto Market is in Bitcoin Season Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wondered whether it’s the season for Altcoins to shine or for Bitcoin to lead the charge? There’s a handy tool many in the community watch: the Altcoin Season Index . And right now, according to the latest data, this key metric is signaling a specific phase for the crypto market . As of 00:38 UTC on June 19, the Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap, registered a reading of 22. This is a slight uptick from the previous day but firmly places the market in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does that mean for your portfolio and the broader digital asset landscape? What is the Altcoin Season Index? Understanding the Metric Before we dive into what a reading of 22 signifies, let’s break down this crucial index. The Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a specific metric designed to gauge the relative performance of major Altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a defined period. The Source: It’s tracked by reputable platforms like CoinMarketCap, providing data based on a broad spectrum of the market. The Scope: The index focuses on the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The Timeframe: It analyzes performance over the past 90 days. This rolling window provides a dynamic view of recent market trends rather than a static snapshot. The Comparison: The core of the index is a direct comparison: How many of these top 100 Altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window? Think of it like a scorecard where each of the top 100 non-stablecoin/wrapped tokens gets a point if it has performed better than Bitcoin over the last three months. The index score is essentially the percentage of these Altcoins that have beaten Bitcoin. Decoding the Seasons: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Thresholds The Altcoin Season Index uses specific thresholds to define the prevailing market ‘season’. These thresholds provide clear markers for investors to understand whether Altcoins or Bitcoin are currently leading the market momentum. Here’s how the seasons are defined: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 Altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season. During this phase, we typically see significant rallies across a broad range of Altcoins, sometimes with many experiencing parabolic growth. Bitcoin Season: This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 Altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score of 25 or lower signals Bitcoin Season . In this environment, Bitcoin often dominates the market narrative and capital flows, either holding value better during downturns or leading during uptrends, while many Altcoins may lag behind or even lose value against Bitcoin. Neither Season (or ‘Other’): If the index falls between 26 and 74, the market isn’t clearly in either Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season. This period can be characterized by choppy price action, sector rotation, or a less defined market trend where performance is more mixed across different assets. So, with the index currently sitting at 22, the data explicitly tells us the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . Why the Current Reading of 22 Signals Bitcoin Season A reading of 22 means that over the last 90 days, only 22% of the top 100 eligible Altcoins have managed to perform better than Bitcoin . This is significantly below the 75% threshold required for Altcoin Season and falls squarely within the Bitcoin Season . What does this performance gap suggest? It indicates that capital has likely been flowing disproportionately into Bitcoin , or perhaps flowing out of Altcoins faster than out of Bitcoin. This could be due to several factors: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of uncertainty in the broader financial markets or even within the crypto space, investors often flock to Bitcoin as the most established and liquid digital asset, viewing it as a relatively ‘safer’ store of value compared to more volatile Altcoins. Institutional Interest: Much of the recent institutional investment has been focused primarily on Bitcoin, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions. Large capital inflows into Bitcoin naturally increase its market dominance and can pull performance away from Altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in interest rates, inflation data, or global economic outlook can influence investor risk appetite. During periods of heightened caution, riskier assets (which Altcoins are generally perceived to be compared to Bitcoin) tend to underperform. Post-Halving Dynamics: Following a Bitcoin halving event, historical patterns often show a period where Bitcoin consolidates or makes initial moves, with Altcoins potentially lagging before catching up later in the cycle. We are currently in the period following the April 2024 halving. Being in Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean Altcoins are necessarily losing value in absolute terms (though many might). It specifically means they are, on average, underperforming relative to Bitcoin over the past three months. Historical Context: When Have We Seen Altcoin Season Before? Understanding the current state is often best done by looking at the past. True Altcoin Season , where the index consistently stays above 75, is a less frequent phenomenon than periods of Bitcoin dominance or ‘neither season’. Notable periods of strong Altcoin Season include: Late 2017 / Early 2018: This was arguably the most iconic Altcoin Season, fueled by the ICO boom. Many Altcoins saw exponential gains, and the index likely stayed high for a significant period as retail investors piled into virtually anything crypto-related. Mid-2020 to Early 2021: Following the March 2020 crash and leading into Bitcoin’s break of its all-time high, a strong Altcoin Season emerged. This was driven by increased DeFi adoption, the rise of new layer 1s, and renewed retail and institutional interest expanding beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum’s significant rally was a key part of this period, pulling many other Altcoins up with it. Parts of 2021 (e.g., Spring 2021): Even within the broader bull market, there were distinct periods where Altcoins saw explosive growth relative to Bitcoin, often tied to specific narratives like NFTs, specific blockchain ecosystems, or meme coins. These periods were characterized by high market enthusiasm, significant technological developments in the Altcoin space, and often, a feeling that Bitcoin had made its major move and it was ‘time’ for Altcoins to catch up. Conversely, Bitcoin Season often follows periods of high Altcoin euphoria (as capital rotates back to the perceived safety of Bitcoin) or occurs during market downturns or periods of consolidation after a large Bitcoin rally. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Altcoins and Bitcoin Investors So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What should investors and traders consider? This phase of the crypto market presents unique challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Many Altcoins may continue to lose value relative to Bitcoin, meaning even if they go up in dollar terms, they might go down when measured in satoshis (fractions of Bitcoin). Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Altcoins can be more susceptible to sharp drops during Bitcoin consolidations or pullbacks. Difficulty in Picking Winners: While some Altcoins might still perform well based on specific news or developments, a broad-based rally driven by overall market momentum is less likely during Bitcoin Season. Opportunities & Actionable Insights: Accumulate Bitcoin: If you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue or increase, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin during this period might be a primary strategy. Strategic Altcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to buy quality Altcoins at potentially lower prices, especially relative to Bitcoin. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and engaged communities that you believe will perform well when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Reduce Altcoin Exposure: For those with high Altcoin exposure, this might be a time to de-risk slightly by converting some Altcoins back into Bitcoin or stablecoins, especially if you hold Altcoins with weaker fundamentals. Focus on Specific Narratives: While broad Altcoin performance is weak relative to Bitcoin, specific sectors (like AI, DePIN, or specific L2 solutions) might still see bursts of activity. Researching and focusing on these specific narratives could yield results, but carries higher risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regardless of the season, consistently investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of trying to time the market perfectly. This can be applied to both Bitcoin and selected Altcoins. Set Alerts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index itself. A sustained move upwards, particularly towards the 25-30 mark and beyond, could be an early signal that market dynamics are starting to shift. It’s crucial to remember that market cycles are fluid. Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever, just as Altcoin Season doesn’t. The index provides a snapshot of the recent past (90 days) and current momentum, not a guaranteed forecast of the future. Looking Ahead: What Could Trigger the Next Altcoin Season? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the question on many investors’ minds is: When will Altcoin Season return? Predicting market shifts is impossible with certainty, but we can identify potential triggers and signals to watch for: Sustained Decrease in Bitcoin Dominance: The most obvious signal is a downtrend in Bitcoin’s percentage of the total crypto market cap. As Bitcoin’s dominance falls, it typically means capital is rotating into Altcoins. Breakout Performance from Major Altcoins: If Ethereum (ETH) or other large-cap Altcoins start to significantly outperform Bitcoin, it can pull the rest of the market with them. Successful network upgrades (like Ethereum’s future developments) can be catalysts. Emergence of Powerful New Narratives: New technological trends or use cases (like the next wave of DeFi, GameFi, specific Layer 2 solutions, or entirely new concepts) that gain significant traction and investment can drive Altcoin performance. Increased Retail Investor Activity: Altcoin Season is often fueled by retail enthusiasm, as smaller investors are more likely to speculate on lower-priced, higher-potential Altcoins. A surge in retail interest and new money entering the market can be a strong catalyst. Favorable Macroeconomic Conditions: A global economic environment where investors are more willing to take on risk can benefit Altcoins disproportionately. A Significant Bitcoin Rally Followed by Consolidation: Sometimes, Bitcoin makes a large upward move first, drawing attention and capital. Once Bitcoin consolidates at a new high, capital can then flow into Altcoins looking for the ‘next big gain’. Monitoring these potential catalysts alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself can provide valuable clues about potential market shifts. A gradual increase in the index score towards the ‘Neither Season’ zone (26-74) and eventually towards the Altcoin Season threshold (75+) would be a strong indicator that the winds are changing. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market Seasons The Altcoin Season Index provides a data-driven perspective on whether Altcoins or Bitcoin have been the stronger performers recently. Its current reading of 22 clearly indicates that the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season , meaning Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 Altcoins over the past 90 days. This doesn’t mean Altcoins are irrelevant, but it highlights the prevailing market dynamic. For investors, understanding this can inform strategy – whether it’s focusing on Bitcoin accumulation, selectively buying Altcoins with strong conviction at potentially attractive relative prices, or simply exercising caution with broader Altcoin exposure. Market seasons are cyclical. While we are in Bitcoin Season now, the factors driving performance are constantly evolving. Staying informed, understanding the metrics like the Altcoin Season Index , and adapting your strategy based on data and your own risk tolerance are key to navigating the exciting, albeit sometimes challenging, world of cryptocurrency investing.

The Treasury chief declared that digital assets are “one of the most important phenomena in the world right now” while criticizing how they have been “ignored by national governments for far too long.” Crypto is not a threat to the dollar. In fact, stablecoins can reinforce dollar supremacy. Digital assets are one of the most important phenomena in the world right now, yet they have been ignored by national governments for far too long. This administration is committed to… pic.twitter.com/vWsLgYyNW7 — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) June 18, 2025 His remarks come as President Trump urgently calls for swift House passage of the GENIUS Act without amendments, demanding lawmakers deliver the comprehensive stablecoin regulation bill to his desk “ASAP” following the Senate’s decisive 68-30 approval vote. The Treasury Secretary’s embrace of cryptocurrency as a tool for dollar reinforcement rather than replacement directly contrasts with growing European concerns, as Italy’s Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti warns that U.S. stablecoin policies could pose a “more dangerous impact on the euro than the effects of trade tariffs.” Dollar Supremacy vs. European Monetary Sovereignty The global monetary implications of America’s pro-crypto stance have created a fascinating geopolitical dynamic that extends far beyond traditional trade concerns. European policymakers recognize that digital assets represent a new front in currency competition. Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, warned that the Trump administration’s favorable approach toward dollar-denominated stablecoins could affect the eurozone’s “monetary sovereignty and financial stability” by encouraging the adoption of alternative payment methods that bypass European financial institutions entirely. Italy’s Giorgetti articulated the most direct challenge to European monetary policy, explaining how U.S. stablecoin policies inadvertently offer European savers a pathway to invest in risk-free dollar-denominated assets without requiring banking relationships with American institutions. This development threatens to fragment Europe’s payment industry while strengthening the dollar’s role as the preferred store of value for international transactions. Does Europe really need a digital euro? Experts weigh in on privacy, regulation, and the role of stablecoins at UN:BLOCK crypto conference #DigitalEuro #CBDC https://t.co/sjQoXA1ayi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 The concern has prompted the European Central Bank to accelerate its digital euro project , though implementation remains years away, with a rollout not anticipated until 2028 or 2029. While Europe sees it as a threat, the pent-up demand for clarity and the GENIUS Act’s comprehensive framework could trigger a wave of institutional adoption that further entrenches dollar-denominated stablecoins as the backbone of global crypto trading and cross-border payments. GENIUS Act Near Victory Amid Political Controversy The GENIUS Act’s path to approval has been marked by intense partisan debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren led Democratic opposition by highlighting potential conflicts of interest related to Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures. Warren’s concerns center on Trump’s USD1 stablecoin, which reportedly generated $57 million last year through the World Liberty Financial platform. This raises questions about whether the president could profit from legislation he signs into law. Despite these objections, 18 Democrats joined most Republicans in supporting the Senate version. Senator Cynthia Lummis has emerged as a key advocate for broader crypto legislation , arguing that while the GENIUS Act represents progress, comprehensive market structure legislation remains necessary to establish the United States as the global “crypto capital.” Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill @POTUS ' vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world. pic.twitter.com/tyz6Kbc5qK — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 18, 2025 Trump’s urgent call for House passage without amendments is a strategic calculation to lock in digital asset policy before potential complications arise from extended congressional negotiations or bundling with more contentious crypto legislation. The president’s allies view rapid approval as essential to maintaining momentum for his administration’s broader digital asset agenda, which includes establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves and positioning America as the global blockchain development hub. The GENIUS Act represents Congress’s first major attempt to regulate the rapidly expanding stablecoin market, which has grown from under $10 billion to $239 billion in just five years. The legislation would establish a federal licensing system requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain full 1:1 backing with U.S. dollars while restricting reserves to redemptions and low-risk investments such as Treasury repos. Before now, the regulatory uncertainty has contributed to a 14% decline in the U.S. share of global blockchain developers since 2018, falling to just 26% by 2023.

2025-06-19T08:30:36,"Iran imposes curfew on crypto exchanges following Nobitex hack","Iran has ordered a curfew on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges after a politically motivated attack on the country’s largest trading platform, Nobitex. According to blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis, the June 18 hack resulted in losses upwards of $90 million. The funds, which included assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, and Ton, were drained from Nobitex’s hot wallets and subsequently burned, making them permanently inaccessible. In response to the incident, the Central Bank of Iran restricted the operating hours of all local crypto exchanges, limiting them to between 10 am and 8 pm. “This operational curfew could signal increasing pressure on exchanges operating within Iran, as the regime attempts to manage systemic risk in a market that plays an outsized role in navigating around global sanctions,” the analytics firm wrote in a recent report . Pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, also known as Predatory Sparrow, has claimed responsibility and stated that the operation was intended to disrupt Iran’s sanctioned financial infrastructure. The stolen assets were sent to burner wallets without private key access, indicating a deliberate act of destruction. You might also like: Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex suffers $81M exploit, pro-Israel hacker group takes credit Chainalysis’s findings confirmed that none of the funds were sent to mixers or exchanges, and a significant portion was transferred to addresses labeled with anti-IRGC slogans. Some were sent to blockchain burn addresses, including Ethereum’s “0x…dead” wallet, while a portion of Bitcoin was directed to a provably unspendable address with an invalid checksum. Nobitex is widely considered a central pillar of Iran’s crypto economy. According to Chainalysis, it has processed over $11 billion in total inflows, more than the combined inflows of Iran’s ten next-largest crypto exchanges. It acts as the backbone for the majority of on-chain activity in the country and serves as a gateway to global markets for users cut off from traditional finance due to international sanctions. Beyond its domestic role, Chainalysis linked Nobitex to wallets associated with a range of sanctioned and illicit actors. These include ransomware operators affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, pro-Hamas media channels such as Gaza Now, and sanctioned Russian crypto exchanges including Garantex and Bitpapa. The Nobitex hack followed a series of Israeli airstrikes inside Iran, part of ongoing military and cyber tensions between the two countries. The attackers published inflammatory wallet labels and threatened to release internal source code and infrastructure data unless Nobitex users withdrew funds. In its official response, Nobitex said user assets remain secure in cold storage and that all hot wallets have been emptied. It also confirmed that its reserve fund would fully cover the losses and that it has taken steps to bolster platform security, including migrating funds to new offline wallets.

2025-06-19T08:28:48,"The Smarter Web Company boosts Bitcoin holdings to 346 BTC after doubling fundraising target","The Smarter Web Company has expanded its BTC treasury to over 346 coins, following a a highly successful fundraise that brought in nearly double its initial target. On June 19, London-listed technology firm The Smarter Web Company announced that it had expanded its Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury with the acquisition of 104.28 BTC at an average price of £77,751 ($104,451) per coin. The purchase, totaling £8,108,114, brings the company’s total BTC holdings to 346.63 BTC. Altogether, the company has spent £27.2 million on Bitcoin so far, with an average purchase price of £78,480 ($105,430) per BTC. The acquisition follows a recently completed fundraise, announced on June 16, which was done through a mix of institutional bookbuilding and qualified investor subscriptions. The fundraising target was at least £15 million, but due to strong demand, they raised approximately £29.3 ($37.1) million — nearly double that amount. However, the capital raise resulted in a 7.39% dilution for existing shareholders, including directors, who maintained their share counts but saw slight decreases in ownership percentages. You might also like: U.K.’s Smarter Web Company adds $2.7m worth of Bitcoin to its holdings The Smarter Web Company regularly adds to its Bitcoin stash as part of its long-term “10 Year Plan,” which centers on keeping an active Bitcoin treasury as a key part of its financial strategy. Just a few days before the latest fundraising, on June 13, they bought 74.27 BTC for £5.98 million, bringing their total to 242.34 BTC at that point. With the latest purchase of 104.28 BTC, their Bitcoin holdings have jumped by 43% since that last buy. Other UK companies are also expanding their BTC holdings. Most notably, London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital recently acquired approximately 2,949 BTC, worth over $250 million, taking advantage of a market dip. Meanwhile, more UK firms are embracing a Bitcoin treasury strategy inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy .

2025-06-19T08:20:49,"Bitcoin ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Despite Middle East Tensions","The inflows remained strong despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. BlackRock’s IBIT led with nearly $279 million in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC also posted impressive gains. Meanwhile, Ether ETFs, led by BlackRock’s ETHA, also resumed their positive momentum. In contrast, Iran’s crypto sector suffered after a pro-Israel hacking group exploited the Nobitex exchange, which caused the central bank to restrict trading hours. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, also recently warned of a societal collapse due to France’s increasing censorship and regulatory pressure. Bitcoin ETFs Thrive in Volatile Market Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded $388.3 million in inflows on June 18. This was the eighth consecutive day of capital injections despite the geopolitical tension stemming from the Israel-Iran conflict. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) According to data from Farside Investors , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack with $278.9 million in inflows, followed by the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $104.4 million. The consistent demand means that there is still institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even after markets initially reacted nervously to Middle East developments. Crypto analytics platform Santiment pointed out that Bitcoin stayed resilient in the $104,000 to $105,000 range throughout the day. They mentioned that this behavior mirrors patterns that were seen in previous geopolitical events like the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in late 2023, where Bitcoin initially dropped but quickly stabilized. Other ETFs also showed strength, with the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recording an $11.3 million inflow, while products from ARK Invest, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree did not register any movement. The only major outflows came from Grayscale products. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) lost $16.4 million, while its lower-cost counterpart, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, shed another $10.1 million. Still, the broader trend is still positive. Since April 17, Bitcoin ETFs recorded just eight days of net outflows, and attracted $11.2 billion in inflows. In total, more than $46.3 billion has flowed into the eleven US-based Bitcoin ETFs to date, with BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC managing $50.6 billion and $11.5 billion in assets, respectively. This includes large outflows of $23.2 billion from Grayscale’s GBTC product. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs in the US are also seeing increased attention. Despite a brief pause in inflows on June 13, the funds bounced back with three straight days of inflows between June 16 and 18. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is leading the Ether ETF market as well, and it only experienced two days without inflows since May 20. Iran Limits Crypto Exchange Hours After Pro-Israel Hack While the Middle East tensions did not slow down inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it did impact the crypto space in Iran itself. Iran’s central bank imposed strict operating hours on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges after a major security breach at Nobitex, the country’s leading crypto trading platform. The new regulations restrict trading to between 10 am and 8 pm to try and improve oversight and manage potential future attacks during working hours. The decision was made after pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for an exploit that drained over $100 million from Nobitex’s hot wallets across multiple cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana. According to Chainalysis , the stolen funds were not transferred to new wallets for profit but were instead sent to burner addresses, permanently removing them from circulation. This politically motivated attack stands out in contrast to typical financially driven exploits. Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, explained that Iran may be trying to assert tighter control over citizen crypto activity, particularly during a period of rising geopolitical tension and the potential for capital flight. This is not the first time Iran’s central bank intervened in the crypto market. In December, all exchanges were temporarily shut down to prevent further devaluation of the Iranian rial. Now, in the wake of the Nobitex incident and Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian territory on June 13, authorities are once again exercising tighter control over the country’s crypto infrastructure. Nobitex confirmed the breach publicly, and announced that external access to its servers had been severed. The exchange reassured its users that its reserve fund will fully cover the losses and that affected hot wallets are being moved to cold storage. However, internet disruptions and restricted server access are likely to delay the restoration of user access. (Source: Chainalysis ) Chainalysis shed some light on Nobitex’s central role in Iran’s digital asset ecosystem, with more than $11 billion in inflows. This is much larger than the next ten Iranian exchanges combined. The platform is seen as a vital link for Iranians navigating sanctions to participate in global crypto markets. However, its operations have also been connected to groups considered terrorist organizations by Western authorities, as well as sanctioned Russian exchanges like Garantex and Bitpapa. Pavel Durov Warns of Collapse in France Tensions are mounting in other parts of the world as well. Telegram founder Pavel Durov warned that France risks facing societal collapse if it continues pursuing what he describes as a misguided path of censorship and overregulation. In an interview with French publication Le Point, Durov expressed his disappointment with President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, and stated that France is becoming “weaker and weaker” and losing its competitive edge. He explained that failing to enact necessary reforms and raising generations under restrictive ideologies could lead to extreme transformations or even collapse. This is in stark contrast with innovation-friendly environments like Dubai, which he said are attracting France’s top talent. Pavel Durov Durov’s comments are part of a broader media campaign he undertook since his arrest in France in August of 2024. That arrest drew a lot of backlash from the crypto industry and global civil rights advocates, who saw it as a threat to free speech and digital sovereignty. While the legal case is still under international scrutiny, Durov speaks out against what he sees as creeping authoritarianism under the guise of regulatory reform. (Source: X ) In the interview, Durov also made serious allegations against France’s intelligence services by claiming that their chief, Nicolas Lerner, approached him at the Hôtel de Crillon and requested the censorship of pro-conservative content ahead of Romania’s May 2025 presidential election. Durov said he refused the request as it contradicted the principles of open discourse. He also criticized the European Union’s Digital Services Act, and described it as a deceptive legislative framework that could enable widespread censorship under the pretext of consumer protection and misinformation control. Durov warned that such laws are inherently dangerous, as they could eventually be turned against those who helped enact them.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9620/bitcoin-et-fs-extend-inflow-streak-despite-middle-east-tensions,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T08:16:14,"Bitcoin Ecosystem Poised for Major Growth as Scaling Advances and Institutional Adoption Deepens","The Bitcoin ecosystem is in a crucial state of transformation, as it expands far beyond its initial primary role as a store of value. The scaling solutions now being focused upon, along with the robust DeFi structure that is taking shape on the Bitcoin network, mean that attention is shifting quite rapidly from the paradigm of Bitcoin as a mostly static, low-throughput asset to that of a far more dynamic and fully usable Bitcoin network. Even at a low level of infrastructural development, the promise of a rigorous stack of DeFi primitives emerging on the Bitcoin network is pushing the price of Bitcoin upward—and for the first time, really, signaling to the architecture community that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is ripe for serious redevelopment and renovation. Bitcoin Ecosystem The Bitcoin ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with a strong focus on scaling solutions. Once the #Bitcoin scaling challenge is addressed, a flourishing DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin seems almost inevitable. This is especially true given Bitcoin’s dramatically… pic.twitter.com/zvac3yQCMH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 18, 2025 Even with the spectacular rally of Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark, vital signs indicate that the market is not yet in the speculative bubble mode of prior peak periods. This creates the perhaps unprecedented situation of Bitcoin being up over 1,000% in the past year, yet being looked at as a relatively stable investment. In any case, it is virtually unthinkable that the current Bitcoin price level is anywhere near the ceiling. Scaling Unlocks the Path to Bitcoin DeFi The perennial problem of scalability on Bitcoin has been a serious bottleneck for greater utility and application development. Yet, a few recent developments in Layer 2 solutions—like the Lightning Network and other off-chain transaction frameworks—are finally starting to show some real promise. These innovations have allowed the network to achieve something that’s relatively rare in the world of Bitcoin: faster and cheaper transactions. And that, in turn, is enabling something that’s even rarer in the world of DeFi: a native ecosystem. DeFi has been built on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. But building DeFi on Bitcoin has not yet been realized. With its serious security and phenomenal name recognition, Bitcoin could very well become the backbone of a future decentralized financial system—if the protocols keep improving in usability and scaling. This evolution is happening when institutional investors and state-level actors are taking part in Bitcoin like never before. Government-backed initiatives, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds have been putting real capital into Bitcoin, and the above-mentioned developments are only adding more and seemingly inexorable momentum to the Bitcoin ecosystem’s evolution and maturation. Market Still in Cooling Zone Despite All-Time Highs While Bitcoin trades easily above $100,000, its present MVRV ratio—a key valuation metric comparing market value to realized value—lingers at a modest 2.25. This is reminiscent of the way things were in the lead-up to the 2023 Bitcoin Halving, in that the MVRV was somewhat low relative to the price action (like way back in 2021). And yet, we must also say that the 2.25 figure has not typically been associated with major market tops. The last time the MVRV ratio had a similar reading (in the bull run leading to the 2021 Bitcoin top) was when prices were under $40,000. Although Bitcoin is now trading comfortably above $100k, its MVRV ratio is only 2.25; still far below previous cycle peaks, even after factoring in the indicator’s long-term downward drift. This indicates the market still isn't as overheated as it was during earlier peaks pic.twitter.com/4TX39NLU3s — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) June 17, 2025 Also, this relatively tame MVRV ratio occurs despite the indicator’s long-term trending downward. This drift suggests a market that is long overdue for an awesome, almost cavalier, sense of achievement (a.k.a. a market in BTC that is increasingly mature and efficient). The current MVRV reading entertains the rising BTC price not yet in a zone of dangerous overexuberance. This is being interpreted by investors, traders, and analysts as a sign that the current cycle may have more room to run. If inflation and the debasement of fiat currencies continue to drive demand for hard, decentralized assets, we might be in for quite a run. Whale Movements Signal Strategic Adjustments The overall market is fairly stable, but the recent activity of a few important traders shows the overall market is more than what’s on the surface. One of these traders, the “Mysterious Whale”—under the handle @AguilaTrades—recently made some news by not just rebalancing but by really cutting back on a huge leveraged position. Aguila started with a position that was 20 times as large as Bitcoin’s price when he bet on the cryptocurrency in October 2021. The trader initially opened a 20x long position valued at $424 million, representing a bold bet on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. However, after recent developments in the market and price actions, he has now closed the majority of that position and reduced his holdings to just 736.5 BTC, a far cry from the original 3,952.66 BTC he controlled. The value of the remaining position, at current prices, is approximately $77 million. Exiting after a previous trade that resulted in a loss of $12.5 million, Aguila has now realized total losses of over $15 million. This retreat makes clear that even with Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs, high-leverage players are exercising a lot more caution these days. While the move may well reflect risk management on the part of Aguila, it also underscores how short-term, high-volatility trading is a bit of a crapshoot right now. Even with these adjustments being made, they don’t seem to have affected investors’ overall enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency space. “On-chain data and macro signals continue to impressed, support a longer-term bullish narrative, especially as the Bitcoin ecosystem extends its reach toward not just being a store of simple value, but also toward building a complex financial infrastructure in addition to that simple value storage.” – Wall Street Journal As the ecosystem keeps maturing, a completely realized Bitcoin-native DeFi landscape is no longer a hypothetical—it’s an emerging reality with deep institutional roots and global potential.

Despite strong ETF inflows and positive signs from the market, the price isn’t breaking out. So what’s holding it back? Recent reports reveal that both short-term traders and long-term holders are quietly selling. Even Bitcoin miners are adding to the pressure. Let’s take a deeper look into what’s really going on behind the scenes. Short-Term Holders Taking Profits Over the last few weeks, Bitcoin has faced heavy selling pressure from different types of holders. According to Glassnode, wallets that held Bitcoin for less than a year accounted for 83% of realized profits recently. Just six to twelve-month holders alone sold over $904 million worth of BTC, one of the highest selling amounts this year. Last week, we highlighted how $BTC wallets that held >12m were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. Yesterday: 6–12m holders alone realized $904M – second-highest daily profit YTD pic.twitter.com/gBD8tLCjVG — glassnode (@glassnode) June 17, 2025 But it’s not just the short-term crowd. Even long-term holders who’ve kept their BTC for over a year are cashing out. In early June, they realized a massive $1.2 billion in profits. While that number has dropped, it still shows how veteran investors are using this range to take money off the table. Miners Add to Selling Pressure Another group adding pressure is the miners.Recent data shows they’ve sold 30,000 BTC in just 20 days, lowering their total holdings from 1.94 million to 1.91 million BTC. While this isn’t huge compared to the total market volume, it adds to the overall pressure keeping Bitcoin from breaking higher Investors Searching For Other Option At the same time, some institutional investors are shifting their focus. Delta-neutral strategies, which involve locking in gains without price risk, are giving returns of 15–30% APY. That’s attractive compared to holding Bitcoin, which has already seen huge gains from $75K to $100K in under two months. With fewer explosive gains expected from Bitcoin now that it’s over $100K, some funds are diversifying into gold, stocks, or private assets. Low Funding Rates Signal Healthy Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. According to on-chain analytics from Santiment , this price stability is accompanied by notably low funding rates, which is an encouraging sign for the market’s overall health. Funding rates are a key indicator in the crypto derivatives market. When these rates are low, it means there isn’t a surge of traders using leverage to bet on Bitcoin’s price moves. Bitcoin: Key Level To Watch Out As of now, Bitcoin continues to trade above the $100,000 mark, currently hovering around $104,665. Bitcoin’s next big breakout likely depends on U.S. stocks moving higher or broader liquidity returning to markets. The key levels to watch are $102,000 and $106,000.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-stuck-above-100k-whos-selling-and-slowing-the-next-big-rally/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T08:10:05,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 57: Crucial Shift into Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 57: Crucial Shift into Greed Zone Curious about the mood of the digital asset space? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular barometer for gauging the prevailing emotion in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, this index has shown a significant uptick, signaling a notable shift in crypto market sentiment . Let’s dive into what this move means and how this fascinating tool works. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aggregates various market data points to produce a single number between 0 and 100. This number aims to represent the current emotional state of the market participants. A score closer to 0 signifies extreme fear, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarian investors, while a score near 100 indicates extreme greed, which some view as a signal for a potential market correction. As of June 19, the index registered a value of 57, a five-point increase from the previous day. This upward movement pushed the index out of the ‘Neutral’ territory and firmly into the ‘Greed’ zone. This shift suggests that market participants are becoming more optimistic and confident, potentially driven by recent price movements or positive news flow. Here’s a simple breakdown of the index zones: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-59: Neutral 60-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed What Factors Influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index isn’t based on a single metric but is a composite of six key factors, each weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values. High volatility, especially downwards, can increase fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans Twitter for specific posts related to Bitcoin and analyzes their sentiment and engagement rates. A high volume of positive, engaged tweets suggests greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused by Alternative) This factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear of altcoins and a flight to the perceived safety of Bitcoin, while decreasing dominance might signal increasing greed for potentially higher altcoin gains. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Search data for search queries related to Bitcoin. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “how to buy Bitcoin” can indicate growing public interest and potentially greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does it Mean for Trading Psychology? The index moving into the ‘Greed’ zone is often interpreted as a sign that the market is heating up. Investors are becoming more confident, perhaps even euphoric. This increased confidence can lead to more aggressive buying, potentially driving prices higher in the short term. However, it’s crucial to understand the implications for trading psychology . Historically, periods of extreme greed have sometimes preceded market pullbacks or corrections. When greed is high, investors might overlook risks, chase hype, and make impulsive decisions based on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can create a bubble-like environment that is vulnerable to sudden reversals. Therefore, while ‘Greed’ indicates positive momentum, it also serves as a yellow flag, reminding participants to exercise caution and avoid getting swept up in the euphoria. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ are often associated with market bottoms, as panic selling drives prices down, potentially creating opportunities for those brave enough to buy against the prevailing sentiment. The index essentially quantifies these collective emotional states, offering a counter-perspective to purely fundamental or technical analysis. Using the Index: Actionable Insights and Crypto Volatility How can investors and traders use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s best viewed as a supplementary tool, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use the index as a contrarian signal. Extreme fear might suggest a potential buying opportunity (when others are panicking), while extreme greed might suggest a potential selling opportunity (when the market is overheated). Sentiment Confirmation: It can help confirm or question your own read on the market. If you feel the market is fearful but the index is high, it prompts further investigation. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score can be a reminder to tighten stop losses, reduce leverage, or take some profits, acknowledging the increased risk of a downturn fueled by high crypto volatility . Understanding Market Phases: The index helps visualize the cyclical nature of market emotions, from panic and capitulation (fear) to optimism and euphoria (greed). It’s important to remember that the crypto market, known for its high crypto volatility , can change sentiment rapidly. The index provides a snapshot, but market conditions are constantly evolving. Limitations and Considerations While valuable, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not without limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects sentiment, which correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t directly *cause* them. External news, regulations, or technological developments are primary drivers. Bitcoin-Centric: While it considers Bitcoin dominance, the underlying factors (volatility, volume, social media, Google Trends) are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts specific to altcoins. Historical Data: The effectiveness of using the index as a contrarian tool is based on historical patterns, which may not always repeat. Factor Weighting: The specific weightings assigned to each factor are determined by Alternative and might be debated. Therefore, always use the index in conjunction with other forms of analysis, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Market Psychology The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 57 and its entry into the ‘Greed’ zone marks a significant moment for crypto market sentiment . It reflects increasing optimism among participants, driven by a combination of factors like market momentum, volume, and social buzz. While this indicates positive short-term energy, it also highlights the importance of understanding trading psychology and the inherent crypto volatility . The index serves as a powerful reminder that emotions play a huge role in financial markets. By tracking fear and greed, it offers investors a unique perspective – a pulse check on the collective mindset. As the market continues to navigate its path, keeping an eye on this index, while employing sound risk management strategies and diverse analysis methods, remains a prudent approach for anyone involved in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Could this be where the bleed ends? Solana Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $145 & $147 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Solana based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up? The Cost Basis Distribution tells us about how much of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was last purchased or transferred at what spot price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the data of the indicator for Solana over the past few months. As is visible, there are a few price zones near the current Solana spot price that stand out in terms of the amount of supply that they hold. The $155 to $157 range carries the cost basis of around 31 million tokens and the $164 to $166 range that of 29 million tokens. A third demand zone exists at $145 to $147, a region that the cryptocurrency’s price is currently making a retest of. Here, the investors last purchased a total of 13 million SOL. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so they are more likely to show some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. Generally, this type of reaction isn’t anything relevant for the asset when just a few holders share their acquisition mark at the level, but when a large amount of them are involved, like in the case of the range that SOL is retesting right now, a sizeable reaction can sometimes appear. Generally, these moves tend toward buying when the retest occurs from above. That is, when the investors were in the green prior to the retest. This happens because these holders might believe the price decline to be just a dip opportunity or they may simply want to protect their cost basis. Similarly, holders might panic sell when the retest happens from below. This could happen because underwater sellers can be desperate to get back into the green and once they do, they might fear that the rise is only temporary so they could push for the exit. As Solana is retesting the $145 to $147 range from above, it’s possible that buyers from this region could provide support to the asset and help cushion its fall. In the event that a turnaround does happen, the $155 to $157 resistance range could be of focus next. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? The analytics firm has also shared the CBD of another altcoin, Tron (TRX). As Glassnode explains, Cost Basis Distribution shows TRON found support in the $0.26–$0.27 range, where over 14B $TRX is held -marking the strongest cluster on the chart.

2025-06-19T07:50:08,"1inch price could jump 18% as DAO vote backs 2024 exploit compensation","Cryptocurrencies remained relatively muted over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin remained rangebound . The global crypto market cap declined by 0.51% to $3.27 trillion, while Bitcoin hovers around $105K, trading at $104,987 during this publication. Meanwhile, 1INCH appears ready for potential reversals after weeks of prolonged consolidations and significant downtrends. The alt recently rebounded from the reliable support at $0.1777, hinting at upside price actions. With the underway voting looking to compensate victims of last year’s hack, could 1INCH extend its recovery to the key hurdle at $0.2274? Fundamentals and technical indicators suggest so. DAO proposal to compensate exploited victims 1inch Foundation’s new proposal , dubbed 1IP-80, fuels the prevailing optimism on the digital asset. It seeks to pay individuals who suffered from the October 2024 supply chain exploit. The incident happened after perpetrators leveraged weakness in the website plugin Lottie Player library, stealing tokens worth $768,026. While the protocol recovered most assets from the latest attack (which happened in March 2025), it hasn’t recompensed October victims. Thus, the new proposal seeks to pay affected investors using DAO treasury funds. Compensating exploit victims might renew confidence in the project as it reveals its user-centric approach. The proposal reads: A comprehensive reimbursement maintains user trust, demonstrates ecosystem resilience, and aligns with the DAO’s commitment to community protection. The proposal’s controversy and KYC requirements The proposal has attracted controversies among the DAO community. One side believes compensating users using DAO funds without continued revenue inflows would drain the treasury, weakening 1inch. They trust the project doesn’t boast financial muscles to offer insurance services. However, some argue that the DAO should protect its users. The ongoing voting testifies to the split, with 53.47% (3.8 million) in favor and 46.53% (3.3 million) against. Source: 1inch Network However, only two large addresses dominate the voting, one accounting for all No and the other YES votes. Voting will conclude on 22 June. Meanwhile, the reimbursement plan requires various actions from users (if the proposal passes). First and foremost, they should verify their identities by completing KYC procedures. Also, victims should prove the loss with evidence and file a law enforcement statement. Moreover, they should sign a reimbursement agreement and surrender future rights to any retrieved assets. Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into 1inch’s exploitations is ongoing in the Cayman Islands 1NCH price outlook: an 18% rally imminent? The native token has struggled with notable bearishness lately, depicting deteriorated user confidence, possibly due to hacking incidents. Crypto enthusiasts avoid protocols with weak security infrastructures. 1INCH trades at $0.1916 after dropping 15% and 12% in the past month and week. Nevertheless, price charts bring some hope. 1inch forms a potential reversal pattern on the 4H chart after extended declines. The altcoin has bounced back from the reliable support barrier at $0.1777. 1NCH has tested this zone several times, highlighting buyer interest around the mark. Recently, prices plunged to $0.1744 but rebounded to the support swiftly, creating a potential double-bottom setup, which heralds substantial price rallies. 1inch bulls will target the resistance at $0.2208. That could clear the path to $0.2274, which would mean an 18.69% jump from 1NCH’s current price. The MACD and RSI demonstrate the gradual buyer resurgence. Source: TradingView However, 1inch trades below the 50EMA, indicating seller control. Price dips below $0.1900 could plunge the token to the $0.1777 foothold. Losing $0.1744 will invalidate the bullish narrative and catalyze notable dips or consolidations.

2025-06-19T07:37:12,"Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure","The post Blocksense Moves Beyond the Oracle Bottleneck with Verifiable, Permissionless Infrastructure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As web3 scales across new chains, verticals, and user experiences, one foundational layer has remained frustratingly stagnant: oracles. While computation and storage have seen real breakthroughs, oracle infrastructure still relies heavily on permissioned setups, opaque pricing, and manual onboarding. The result is a bottleneck that slows innovation and burdens newer chains with long lead times and steep costs. Blocksense , a zero-knowledge-native oracle protocol launched in 2024, set out to change that. One year after raising a $4 million pre-seed round, the team has evolved from early-stage concept to active deployments across more than two dozen ecosystems. Live feeds now serve builders on Aztec, Citrea, Pharos, Aurora, TAC, Plume, BIMA, and Manta Network, with the protocol preparing to join EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS), and its SDK entering public release. From Seed Round to Ecosystem Integration In mid-2024, Blocksense raised funding to build oracle infrastructure from scratch. Programmable, verifiable, and open by design. That vision has materialized into a protocol with measurable traction. It uses a ZK rollup-inspired architecture that allows feed updates to be batched and verified through zero-knowledge proofs. This drastically reduces on-chain cost while maintaining full integrity. Consensus is secured using zkSchellingPoint , where reporters vote in secret and are only rewarded if their submissions match the final majority. These aren’t theoretical claims. Blocksense’s system is already live in testnet environments, with pull-model feeds supporting DeFi protocols, prediction markets, real-world attestations, and emerging use cases in AI inference. Oracle-as-Code: Programmability Comes to Data Feeds What truly distinguishes Blocksense from earlier oracle models is its programmability . Legacy oracles operate as walled gardens. Developers often need approvals just to get a new feed listed — a process that can take weeks and limit experimentation. Blocksense flips that model. With its SDK, developers can define oracle logic in a WebAssembly-compatible format, specifying exactly what data to fetch, how to process it, and under what conditions to publish it. Once deployed, these scripts can be executed by node operators and verified on-chain — without any centralized bottlenecks. This shift from “oracle-as-a-service” to “oracle-as-code” unlocks a wide range of new use cases: Pharos uses programmable feeds to resolve prediction markets based on game-theoretic input. TAC triggers smart account actions only when multi-agent intent conditions are met. Citrea leverages custom scripts to publish Bitcoin L2 state views to Ethereum. BIMA verifies off-chain deliberation outcomes from human and AI collectives. Plume relies on oracle scripts to validate real-world asset metadata from partner registries. Manta Network experiments with feeds that verify compliance proofs for zk-based DeFi access. The core design: developers write the logic, node operators execute it, and a zero-knowledge circuit verifies that the votes and aggregation were processed correctly — including cryptographic signature validation and consensus logic. The result is a verifiable, permissionless, and expressive oracle layer designed for modular web3. Scaling Securely Without Sacrificing Trustlessness Blocksense avoids centralized coordination through a blend of cryptography and incentives. Reporters are selected privately and vote without visibility into the network’s state. A structure that discourages collusion and bribery. The system then uses a ZK circuit to prove that only valid votes were counted and that results matched the majority. To support this, the team has grown to 30+ across protocol engineering, cryptography, and developer support. While initial operations are backed by a trusted node set, decentralization is evolving — with open script publishing already live and full operator participation on the roadmap. The upcoming EigenLayer integration will deepen security by allowing Ethereum-aligned stakers to secure Blocksense as an AVS, aligning incentives across protocols, operators, and feed authors. What’s Next for Oracle Infrastructure? Blocksense envisions oracles not just as data feeds, but as middleware for intersubjective truth . The kind needed to verify AI outputs, trigger intent-based contracts, or synchronize decisions across modular systems. For Q2 and beyond, the team is focused on: Finalizing the public SDK for permissionless script creation Expanding support for non-price data formats and AI-related feeds Automating deployment pipelines for new rollups and alt-VMs Scaling incentives for reporters via MEV/OEV participation and AVS yield alignment With its 30+ network integrations, Blocksense is already powering applications that would be impossible to serve through legacy oracle frameworks. Conclusion In 2024, Blocksense raised capital to challenge how oracle data is produced, verified, and consumed. One year later, it has turned that capital into live infrastructure — tested, adopted, and used by real-world developers. Where many protocols celebrate fundraising as a milestone, Blocksense sees it as a starting point. What matters more is the shift it represents: away from permissioned data, toward a world where any developer can define how truth is derived on-chain. For builders seeking autonomy over their data layer, that shift is already underway.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/blocksense-moves-beyond-oracle-bottleneck-with-verifiable-permissionless-infrastructure/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZK","Information",cryptocompare

The total valuation of the industry has dipped slightly to $3.26 trillion. Trading volumes, too, have taken a hit, down by 9% indicating cautious moves by market participants. Talking about blue chip coins, Bitcoin is changing hands at $104,991.34, while Ethereum trades at $2524.22. XRP is slightly down at $2.16, holding on to gains from earlier in the week. The business appears to be in a consolidation phase, with volumes reducing and price ranges tightening. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price continues to hover around the $105k mark, showing resilience despite geopolitical instability. On the charts, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a potential breakout, although the direction remains uncertain. It is worth noting that the support lies at $103,600, and a break below this could drag BTC toward the psychological $100k mark. Contrarily, the bulls must reclaim their foothold at $105,500 and aim for a breakout toward $108,000, where significant resistance awaits. However, with intraday volume at $48.42 billion, down nearly 9%, any upside may be capped unless fresh momentum arrives. Curious about BTC’s long-term growth? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum has been range-bound, with prices slipping 0.54% to $2524.22. However, whale wallets have been actively accumulating, which is a healthy sign for a possible breakout. Traders should take note that the 24H low of $2469.05 serves as immediate support. If ETH price holds above $2,500, a short-term rally to $2,600 is possible. Conversely, falling below $2,460 could take ETH back toward the $2,400 demand zone. That being said, the drop in 24H volume by 17.65% may reflect weakening conviction among retail traders. Interested in stacking some Ether? Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction XRP is showing signs of strength amid broader market uncertainty, down only 0.11% in the past day. Its relatively stable price at $2.16 comes in the wake of positive sentiment from the Canadian XRP ETF approval, which has kept the asset in the spotlight. Technically speaking, XRP is trading close to resistance at $2.18. A bullish breakout could push it toward the $2.30 region. On the downside, support rests at $2.12, and a slip below that may open the gates to $2.00. Despite the price stability, the 14.94% drop in volume signals hesitation in the rally’s continuation.

2025-06-19T07:22:17,"Analysis: Bitcoin’s dormant supply growth outpaces new issuance for the first time in history","For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the amount of BTC held dormant for a decade or more is now growing faster than the network is producing new coins. This shift, which began shortly after the April 2024 halving, marks a critical turning point in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply dynamics, according to a June 18 report by Fidelity Digital Assets. As of June 8, an average of 566 BTC per day is crossing into the “ancient supply” category, meaning the coins have not moved in 10 years or more. That figure now exceeds the network’s post-halving daily issuance rate of 450 BTC. Fidelity’s analysis stresses how the growing influence of long-term holders is redefining Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative in real-time. Dormant coins are often interpreted as a sign of conviction, or in some cases, permanent loss due to inaccessible private keys. Regardless of motive, the numbers are significant. Over 3.4 million BTC, more than 17% of the total supply, have not moved in at least a decade. That figure includes coins mined in Bitcoin’s early years, with Satoshi Nakamoto considered the first 10-year holder as of January 2019. You might also like: Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable This trend is more than symbolic. Fidelity notes that fewer than 3% of days since 2019 have seen a decline in ancient supply, while the portion of coins held for five years or more is also decreasing far less often than it rises. At the same time, public companies are increasingly contributing to this long-term cohort. As of June 8, 27 listed firms held more than 800,000 BTC combined. Projections suggest ancient supply could account for 30% of all Bitcoin in circulation by 2035 if this pattern holds. Still, high conviction isn’t absolute. Since the 2024 U.S. election, the report notes that ancient supply has fallen day-to-day 10% of the time, about four times the historical average. For holders of five years or more, that volatility is even higher, with 39% of days showing net outflows. These movements partly explain the choppy price action in early 2025 and serve as a reminder that even long-term holders can be shaken in uncertain markets. Fidelity emphasizes that scarcity is not the only factor influencing price. However, when issuance is decreasing and long-term supply is tightening, there is a greater chance of upward price pressure, especially if institutional and new ETF product demand picks up speed.
