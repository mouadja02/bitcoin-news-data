2025-06-19T04:49:55,"Over $90M stolen from Iran’s Nobitex exchange burnt by pro-Israel hacker group","After breaching Iran’s largest crypto exchange, the pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande claimed to have destroyed more than $90 million in digital assets taken from Nobitex’s wallets. In a June 18 update via X, the group said it had burned the funds across multiple blockchains using “vanity addresses” that contain no recoverable private keys, effectively rendering the assets permanently inaccessible. This follows the high-profile exploit of Nobitex, in which over $90 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and other tokens were drained from hot wallets. The attackers had originally framed the breach as a direct response to Nobitex’s alleged role in helping the Iranian regime circumvent sanctions and fund terrorism. 12 hours ago 8 burn addresses burned $90M from the wallets of the regime's favorite sanctions violation tool, Nobitex. 12 hours from now The source-code of Nobitex will be open to the public, and Nobitex’s walled garden will be without walls. Where do you want your assets to be?… — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 18, 2025 The group, also known as Predatory Sparrow, tied the hack to ongoing military and cyber tensions between Iran and Israel, which intensified following Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites days earlier. Blockchain security platforms like Chainalysis quickly confirmed that the stolen assets had not been transferred to mixers or exchanges, but rather to irretrievable addresses with inflammatory labels. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran? Some of the addresses included phrases like “FuckIRGCTerroristsNoBiTEX,” targeting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One Bitcoin wallet used in the attack is provably unspendable due to its invalid checksum. On Ethereum, tokens were sent to the “0x…dead” burn address commonly used to retire supply permanently. In response, Nobitex issued a fresh statement acknowledging the burn. The exchange said that user assets are safe in cold storage and that the situation is now under control. Nobitex clarified that as a precaution, its staff had also emptied hot wallets. It reiterated that no customer funds would be lost, citing its reserve fund and insurance pool. Nobitex Announcement No. 4 – Regarding the Security Incident As part of Nobitex’s ongoing response to the recent security incident, we would like to inform our users that the situation is now under control. All external access to our servers has been completely severed. If you… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 18, 2025 The attackers have also threatened to release the source code and internal infrastructure data of Nobitex, which could worsen the situation for Iran’s leading cryptocurrency platform, which has over 11 million users. Gonjeshke Darande warned that any assets left on the platform would be at risk if users did not withdraw immediately. Despite having no financial motivation, the hack has far-reaching implications. The intentional destruction of more than $90 million worth of digital currency demonstrates how state-level conflicts have turned crypto infrastructure into a new battlefield.

2025-06-19T03:37:25,"Binance, OKX Set Transparency Standard with PoR Reports as Coinbase Lags: CQ","A new report by CryptoQuant ranks the transparency of five major crypto exchanges based on their proof-of-reserves (PoR) practices. The analysis revealed that Binance is leading, while other players like Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase are trailing. The PoR Rankings The survey evaluated each exchange’s reserve ratio, a metric calculated by dividing the net customer balance by the platform’s total balance. Binance ranked first in transparency, consistently maintaining a coverage level above 100% and releasing its PoR reports on a monthly and timely basis. OKX followed closely behind, also reporting a capital backing rate that remains above 100%. However, the figure is slightly below Binance’s. The exchange also publishes its disclosures monthly and without delay. Bybit came in next on the list, with a reserve ratio ranging between 105% and 115%. The platform recently improved its disclosure practices by shifting from bi-monthly to monthly reporting. CryptoQuant gave Kraken the fourth spot, with the exchange maintaining backing figures above 100%. However, it has only published four reports since November 22, 2022, with CQ’s analysis highlighting the need for more regular updates. Coinbase is ranked last, as the exchange has not published any PoR report. Analyst Maartun described this trend as a major shortcoming, especially given the company’s size and market position. Coinbase Fails to Reveal Reserves The CryptoQuant quick take noted that Binance and OKX are currently setting the industry standard due to their strong reserve coverage and consistent, on-time reporting. Despite a few gaps that need to be filled, Bybit and Kraken are also making progress. However, Coinbase stood out as the only exchange among the five reviewed that has yet to offer any PoR data. Proof-of-reserves is a method used by crypto exchanges to show that they hold enough digital assets to cover customer deposits. The transparency measure became popular among institutions after big crypto platforms like FTX and Mt. Gox collapsed, leaving investors unsure whether their funds were safe. Despite growing adoption, the practice has also been criticized by some notable crypto industry figures. Strategy’s Michael Saylor recently called it a “ bad idea .” He argued that disclosing wallet addresses, often part of the PoR process, introduces serious security risks. According to the Bitcoin enthusiast, no professional security team would recommend making wallet structures public. He further claimed that if AI were asked to evaluate the risks posed by the practice, it would produce 50 pages of potential threats.

2025-06-19T03:25:13,"Who's Selling Bitcoin Above $100K and Holding Back the Price Rally?","Bitcoin's BTC bull market has stalled, and how. Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows , stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000. It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100 mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation ? According to Alexander Blume, managing partner at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors. ""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups."" Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total. The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits. ""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Thursday. Miners offload BTC Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock . The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days. ""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told COinDesk. Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022. Accumulation stalls for next-best alternatives Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures. ""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Benjamin Lilly, founder of Jarvis Labs, noted. The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility. Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets. ""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk. What next? According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment. ""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted. Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter. ""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said. According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/19/who-s-been-selling-bitcoin-above-usd100k-and-holding-back-the-price-rally,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T03:00:40,"These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend—But Can They Keep It Up?","A few altcoins have diverged from the market with sharp rallies. Here’s whether they can sustain the momentum, according to social media data. Social Media Has Started Paying Attention To These Altcoins In a new insight post, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about some altcoins that have recently diverged from the rest of the market with notable price surges. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? Here are the coins in question and how their monthly returns have looked: As is visible above, these altcoins have managed to deliver sizeable profits during a period where the major assets have printed losses. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, is down around 2% on this timeframe. Among the listed alts, two are particularly prominent in terms of market cap size: Hyperliquid (HYPE) and WhiteBIT Token (WBT). The former has seen a rise of 51.6% and the latter 59.2%. Now, can these coins sustain their runs? One hint can come from social media data. Santiment has shared two indicators related to social media: Social Dominance and Positive/Negative Sentiment. The first metric, the Social Dominance, tells us about what part of social media discussions related to the top 100 assets a particular cryptocurrency is responsible for. The indicator determines this by comparing the asset’s Social Volume, a count of the posts/messages/threads on social media containing unique mentions of the coin, with the combined Social Volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The other metric of interest, the Positive/Negative Sentiment, basically measures the ratio between the positive and negative sentiments present among the social media users. To determine this, the indicator runs the Social Volume of an asset through a machine-learning model to distinguish between bullish and bearish comments. It then takes the ratio of the two to find the net situation on these platforms. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in both of these metrics for Hyperliquid: As displayed in the above graph, the Social Dominance of HYPE peaked at 1.5% in May, but has gone down since then, despite the price continuing its surge. Nonetheless, the indicator has remained at 1.25%, which is still a notable level. Alongside this high attention, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has stayed at around 3.75, which suggests social media users have been making almost 4 times as many bullish comments related to the altcoin as bearish ones. Historically, altcoins have tended to move against the crowd’s expectations, so an excessive sentiment in either direction has often proven to be a reversal signal. This means that an overly bullish mood can actually lead to a top for an asset. Considering this, HYPE may not be in the best position for continuing its surge, at least from the perspective of sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High While Hyperliquid has seen a bit of a cooldown in Social Dominance, WhiteBIT Token has just seen a huge surge. That said, WBT’s Positive/Negative Sentiment hasn’t budged alongside this Social Dominance explosion, although it remains at a notable level of 3.07. Based on the trend, the analytics firm thinks, “we likely will see its price make a second run after its local top that just occurred on June 15th unless FOMO begins to make an appearance.” HYPE Price Hyperliquid has seen a sharp decline since its peak on Monday as its price has come down to $39, a potential sign that the social media hype may already be biting back.

2025-06-19T03:00:37,"Spot Solana ETF Appears On DTCC—When SEC Approval?","VanEck’s proposed spot Solana exchange-traded fund has quietly appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website under the ticker VSOL, placing the product in the clearinghouse’s “active & pre-launch” roster. “BREAKING: VanEck’s Solana ETF (VSOL) is now listed on DTCC… While not an SEC approval, it’s a preparatory step, mirroring BTC and ETH ETFs,” the analytics account SolanaFloor told its 109,000 followers on X overnight. VanEck’s Solana ETF Hits DTCC Listing The DTCC entry signals that the fund’s operational plumbing—creation/redemption identifiers, trade settlement codes and clearing eligibility—has been assigned, even though shares cannot yet be issued. Derivatives and prediction markets reacted swiftly. On Polymarket, the contract that pays out if any Solana ETF is approved by 31 July 2025 now prices a 58–60 % probability, while the full-year contract has surged to 92%. Regulatory handicappers are still leaning bullish. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas wrote that investors should “get ready for a potential alt-coin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way,” and together with colleague James Seyffart now assigns a 90% likelihood of eventual approval. Seyffart tempered near-term euphoria, however, warning that “there needs to be a back-and-forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details,” recalling the flurry of paperwork that preceded January 2024’s spot-Bitcoin launches. That dialogue is already under way. The SEC asked would-be issuers to amend their S-1 registration statements last week; seven managers—including Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Grayscale and Canary—filed updates on 13 June. European digital-asset house CoinShares followed yesterday , becoming the eighth entrant in the race. Macro structure also looks friendlier than during earlier alt-coin attempts. CME Group l aunched cash-settled futures in mid-March, adding the asset to its regulated derivatives suite. While the DTCC listing does not bind the SEC, it places VanEck’s fund on the same procedural track that preceded January 2024’s Bitcoin and July 2024s Ether approvals. Whether that track leads to a July debut—or slips to year-end—now hinges on how quickly staff conclude their review of staking language, custody mechanics and market-manipulation surveillance. For traders, the presence of VSOL on DTCC’s screens is more than cosmetic: it demonstrates that, at least on the market-infrastructure side, the switch has been wired and tested—waiting only for a regulatory finger to press “on.” When SEC Approval? Notably, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s spot-Solana ETF application yesterday—a pause that analyst James Seyffart called “expected… [because] today was only an intermediary deadline.” He added that the agency’s ongoing dialogue over the updated S-1s for Solana-staking products is “a very positive sign,” even if “timelines for approvals are less certain.” Fellow Bloomberg ETF watcher Eric Balchunas concurred , reiterating his 90% base-case odds of eventual approval while cautioning that the current “2-to-4-week” horizon is “ambitious”: “The ball is in the SEC’s court after the S-1s are re-filed; the dialogue between staff and issuers is a great sign, but the timeline is less clear.” Seyffart summed up the mood: “I wouldn’t be shocked if we see approvals in the next month, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if we have to wait until the final deadline in October… At the end of the day, the SEC is engaging—and that’s a good sign.” At press time, SOL traded at $145.89.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-solana-etf-on-dtcc-when-sec-approval/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Solana|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price",cryptocompare

A low was formed at $103,400 and the price started a minor recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,924 swing high to the $103,400 low. However, the bears were active below the $105,500 zone. Bitcoin is now trading below $105,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $105,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $105,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $105,500 level. The next key resistance could be $106,150. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $108,924 swing high to the $103,400 low. A close above the $106,150 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $108,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $110,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $105,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $104,200 level. The first major support is near the $103,500 level. The next support is now near the $102,650 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $101,200 support in the near term. The main support sits at $100,000, below which BTC might gain bearish momentum. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $104,200, followed by $103,500.

2025-06-19T02:00:56,"Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says","Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a moderate price correction since June 11, falling from around $111,000 to just above $104,000 at the time of writing. While rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may be weighing on the asset, several analysts maintain that BTC’s long-term bullish trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin To Top At $205,000? In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Carmelo Aleman pointed to the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend as a signal of strong potential growth in BTC’s price through the rest of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend tracks BTC’s annual price performance since 2011, revealing a recurring pattern of three bullish years followed by one year of consolidation. This trend aligns closely with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle, helping investors identify long-term market phases beyond short-term volatility. Aleman shared the following chart to support his outlook for 2025. If BTC maintains the growth pace typically seen in the third year of this cycle, it could climb 120% in 2025. Such a surge would take BTC from $93,226 at the beginning of the year to as high as $205,097 – potentially marking the cycle top for this year. If realized, this would make 2025 the third consecutive year of gains and complete another full bullish cycle. This scenario suggests that BTC is currently in the final phase of its ongoing cycle, giving investors limited time to adjust their strategies to align with the market’s growth trajectory. Supporting this outlook, other cyclical metrics – such as Realized Cap – continue to post new all-time highs in 2025. Aleman concluded: The Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend is a tool that allows us to filter out daily market noise and reconnect with Bitcoin’s true cyclical nature. It reminds us that beyond micro metrics and short-term candles, Bitcoin adheres to a structural rhythm that repeats with striking consistency: three years of expansion followed by one of compression. On-Chain Indicators Suggest More Upside Beyond the Yearly Percentage Trend, several on-chain metrics continue to support a bullish case for BTC. Notably, both whale and retail BTC inflows to Binance have dropped to cycle-lows – often a sign that investors are holding in anticipation of further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Whales also appear to be accumulating ahead of a potential breakout. According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales withdrew 4,500 BTC from Binance on June 16 – a move historically associated with price rallies. Still, caution remains warranted. On-chain data indicates that short-term holders have been selling into the recent dip, which could temporarily suppress price momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,079, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours.

2025-06-19T01:52:27,"DOJ Ties Kansas Bank Collapse to $225 Million 'Pig Butchering' Seizure","A Kansas banker who looted millions from his small-town bank in 2023 , which triggered its collapse, lost much of the money to overseas crypto scammers targeted in a record-breaking DOJ bust, according to a complaint filed Wednesday. Prosecutors have filed a civil forfeiture action targeting over $225 million in laundered USDT, part of a butchering scam with ties to a Philippines call center that ensnared Shan Hanes, the disgraced former CEO who embezzled $47 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank , a theft which was directly attributed to the agricultural lender's demise in 2023. According to the Department of Justice complaint , OKX, a crypto exchange, provided key information that helped identify an intricate network of accounts on the exchange used to launder the crypto proceeds. Scammers laundered funds by first directing victims to send USDT to 93 scam-controlled deposit addresses. From there, the funds were routed through as many as 100 intermediary wallets in a process designed to obscure the source of funds and mix deposits from multiple victims, according to the complaint. These laundered funds were then funneled into 22 primary OKX accounts and further shuffled across 122 additional OKX accounts, all linked by shared IP addresses, reused KYC documents, and coordinated behavior allegedly traced to a Manila-based scam compound, which the complaint names as ITECHNO Specialist Inc. In total, the DOJ says that approximately $3 billion in transaction volume was generated by this laundering network. Largest victims In total, the DOJ says there were 434 victims and has identified 60 of them who lost a combined $19.4 million. The largest of these victims was Hanes, with the DOJ identifying $3.3 million of the $47 million he embezzled in this seizure. Hanes embezzled the money between May 30, 2023, and July 7, 2023, according to both the DOJ complaint and the Federal Reserve’s report into the collapse of Heartland Tri-State Bank, one of the banks to collapse in the aftermath of the 2023 U.S. banking crisis. During this six-week period, Hanes initiated 10 wire transfers totaling approximately $47.1 million from Heartland Tri-State Bank, a small community lender focused on agricultural loans, to a crypto wallet he controlled. These wire transfers occurred between the bank’s quarterly regulatory reporting periods, allowing the activity to go initially undetected. At the time, Heartland was well-capitalized with $13.7 million in capital and $139 million in assets, but Hanes' actions depleted its liquidity, triggered $21 million in emergency borrowing, and left the bank with a $35 million capital hole, forcing regulators to shut it down in July 2023. According to prior reporting from CNBC , Hanes also stole $40,000 from the Elkhart Church of Christ, $10,000 from the Santa Fe Investment Club, $60,000 from his daughter’s college fund, and liquidated nearly $1 million in stock from a firm called Elkhart Financial to send to pig butchering scammers. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison in August 2024. The DOJ complaint referred to him as both a perpetrator and a victim. Seized crypto likely going to Fed stockpile Crypto seized by the U.S. government, such as in this case, is likely to be earmarked for a not-yet-established stockpile ordered by President Donald Trump. The bitcoin BTC reserve and the stockpile of other cryptocurrencies haven't yet been formally established, but the Treasury Department has been leading an audit of governmental digital asset holdings to determine what needs to be gathered. Once established, the long-term crypto holdings will likely put seized bitcoin in one fund and other types of tokens in another. The holdings in this case appear to be in significant amounts of USDT, according to the filing. It's unclear what funds may eventually be returned to victims, as only a relatively small percentage of those directly harmed have been identified.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/18/doj-ties-kansas-bank-collapse-to-225-million-pig-butchering-seizure,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT","Policy|Pig Butchering|crypto scams|Kansas|Department of Justice|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T01:50:22,"FalconX considers going public in the wave of IPO filings in the crypto space","FalconX held early-stage discussions to take itself public, with an IPO filing potentially hitting this year, said three sources close to the matter. This move will strengthen the firm’s push to serve the surging institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies. The sources said that the cryptocurrency prime broker also had informal talks with bankers and advisers to investigate the IPO process. FalconX is evaluating tapping public markets as it hunts for strategic partnerships and deals. However, it has not hired an investment bank. This is the first formal step to a public listing . Additionally, the company declined to comment on whether it has considered going public. FalconX considers going public in the wave of IPO filings in the crypto space Two sources revealed that FalconX has also discussed ways to boost its public image during the talks. This maneuver may help FalconX’s quest to raise fresh capital for its rapidly expanding company, which has recently increased the pace of its dealmaking. According to a person familiar with the matter, crafting a compelling narrative is crucial when preparing for an IPO, as it shapes how the company is introduced to potential investors. FalconX’s discussions are unfolding amid a surge of initial public offerings in the cryptocurrency sector. A record number of digital asset firms — including Bitcoin services provider Fold, crypto wallet company Exodus, and trading platform eToro — have gone public in 2025. Circle’s listing of approximately $1.1 billion on June 5 marked the largest crypto IPO in recent memory. These developments align with industry experts’ predictions that more digital asset companies will soon join the competition. For instance, in recent weeks, several crypto companies have revealed that they will soon try to access public markets. This happened just days after Circle’s blockbuster IPO, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Bullish and Gemini filed for IPOs. At the same time, c rypto tycoon Justin Sun’s blockchain group Tron is set to go public in the United States through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, a toy company that will rebrand itself as Tron Inc. as part of the deal. The merger deal includes a $100 million equity investment from a private investor affiliated with Sun to establish a Tron treasury, with a total token injection planned to reach up to $210 million in TRX digital tokens, which the new public company will hold as a primary reserve asset, adopting a strategy similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. FalconX positions itself as a financial services provider for the next crypto generation FalconX was established in 2018 as a crypto-focused prime brokerage that allowed clients access to markets where they could trade directly on exchanges. It has since evolved into a trading firm and digital assets services provider. The company operates three verticals — a markets business, a custody and staking business, and a prime brokerage direct-market-access business. It is like a principal trading business or dealer, investing client capital. FalconX has also accelerated its f in the past year to underpin its broadening mandate across its business verticals. The deals put the company in a position to offer services to a broader range of clients as investors’ interest in crypto is exploding. Moreover, in early 2025, FalconX announced that it had purchased crypto derivatives-focused trading company Arbelos Markets to expand in the lucrative global derivatives space. A few months later, FalconX struck a strategic partnership to implement the international banking group Standard Chartered’s banking structure and foreign exchange capabilities into its businesses, enhancing its institutional arm. Following these achievements, Josh Lim, a FalconX co-head of markets, highlighted the company’s aim to be a financial services provider for the next generation of crypto. However, Lim declined to say whether FalconX has been exploring raising new funds. In late May, the company announced its agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald to tap into a large credit facility backed by Bitcoin. This is the “first step in a broader credit framework” that could make it possible for FalconX to cater to more traditional institutional investors, according to FalconX CEO Raghu Yarlagadda. Lim signaled they could acquire many possible partners or companies that offer services connecting their current business areas. Based on his argument, these are services that customers might otherwise need to combine from different sources outside their company. He says they aim to partner with or purchase businesses to help them fill those gaps. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-19T01:30:00,"Next Wave Leaders: Crypto Projects Ready to Move First in Q3","In a market known for its rapid innovation and fast gains, the crypto market requires a keen eye for projects with potential. Waiting too long can be the difference between a 2x return and a 30x gain. In this article, we will explore projects that hold potential for gains of over 3,000%. One of them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , looks especially promising. The project is currently in the presale phase, which means there is potential for massive upside. This is especially so since the project is built on utility, and not merely hype. The projects on this list are built for long-term gains, allowing investors to use the trusted buy-and-forget strategy. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) has been an impressive project when it comes to returns. Over the past decade, its value has grown over 100x. While it is trading close to its most recent all-time high, many investors believe it has potential for gains in the future. One of the main things going for Bitcoin (BTC) is that it was the first crypto coin in the world. As such, it is the most well-known and is now considered to be digital gold by many in the crypto world. At the current price of over $100,000, analysts forecast that it could rise to $150,000 by the end of 2025. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is forecast to offer even bigger returns for investors. As such, for investors looking for new opportunities for growth, MUTM tokens could be a better option. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Massive Growth Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that has received a wave of interest recently from investors looking to extend their gains from the recent bull run. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens could rise by 2,765% in the upcoming altcoin bull run. For context, a $1,700 investment in the presale could grow into $47,005, based on those projections. That is a massive return that no investor wants to miss. On top of these positive projections, Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway . In the ongoing giveaway, the team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 each for participating in the presale. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to make a $50 purchase in the ongoing presale. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The presale has raised over $10.7 million from around 12,100 investors so far. That figure is expected to keep climbing as word spreads about the analysts’ forecasts. Over 38% of the presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have already been sold, a signal of the high interest in this project. Besides the positive forecasts, another major driver of the presale is the CertiK audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a Token Scan Score of 80 from CertiK, which has been a source of trust for the project. A CertiK audit is so important that many investors will not even consider a project if it has not undergone one. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) understood the importance of trust-building, and they made sure to submit their code for CertiK auditing early in the life of the project. To ensure that the project maintains the highest levels of security, the team plans to launch a bug bounty program when it goes live. This program will be an open invitation to security experts, ethical hackers, and blockchain developers to examine the code on their own and alert the internal team. The bug bounty will ensure that there are always eyes on the code in real time. Besides the code, the program will cover the user interface and all API services that will be used within the extensive ecosystem. Tron (TRX) TRX is the native coin of the Tron blockchain and has gained significant traction since it went live. Tron aims to build a decentralized internet and become a competitor to existing projects like Ethereum. The blockchain is touted for its high transaction speed and scalability. Additionally, it is known to have low transaction costs. One of the main downsides of this project is the high level of centralization. Besides that, its founder, Justin Sun, has been a source of controversy in the past, which has not been helpful to the progress of the project. Conclusion 2025 is an exciting year for the crypto sector, and June has brought with it new opportunities for growth. If you are looking to make gains of over 20x, one of your best bets is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Built with a laser focus on utility and ecosystem growth, this could be one of your top gainers this summer.

2025-06-19T01:00:12,"Dogecoin Danger: A Dip Under $0.16 Could Trigger A 30% Crash—Analyst","Dogecoin’s price is back at a crucial line. It’s testing the $0.168 area for a second time since mid‑April. A clear break could send the meme coin spinning lower. Bulls and bears are watching every tick. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Key Support Under Scrutiny According to crypto expert Ali Charts, Dogecoin fell roughly 30% from its mid‑May high. That slide brought it down to the same $0.168 mark that held as support last April. If prices drop below that level on a weekly close, there are hardly any bids to slow the fall. Below $0.168 lies what traders call a “gap area,” where past buying activity was sparse. That could open the door to steeper losses and fast moves. Cup And Handle Pattern Based on reports, the current chart forms part of a four‑year cup‑and‑handle setup. The lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle sits right where the handle meets its cup. A clean break above the triangle’s upper trendline would point to a target near $0.75. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 That projection comes from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup’s depth. Hitting $0.75 would mean a 350% gain from today’s levels. Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Momentum readings have lost much of their shine. After a brief golden cross in May, the 50‑day moving average slipped under the 200‑day in early June. The MACD line is widening beneath its signal, hinting at longer‑term selling pressure. The RSI sits at 42, under the neutral 50 mark, and drifting lower. Under 50 on the RSI often points to more sellers than buyers. With those readings turning sour, bulls need a strong bounce around $0.168 to stay alive. ETF Decision Could Swing Sentiment All eyes now turn to June 15, when US regulators may rule on a spot Dogecoin ETF. Approval would let traditional money flow in from big funds. A thumbs‑down or a delay, on the other hand, could spark fresh sell‑offs. That decision could make or break the next leg of Dogecoin’s move. Related Reading: Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone – What’s Next? According to CoinCodex data, Dogecoin has recorded 13 out of 30 green days over the past month, with price swings of about 10.57% on average. Their forecast pegs DOGE at $ 0.20 by July 18, a 17% rise from current levels. Market sentiment sits in the neutral zone, and on‑chain signals aren’t flashing clear buy or sell warnings. This week’s action around $0.168 will tell us if Dogecoin can steady itself. Holders and traders should watch volume, weekly closes, and that looming ETF call. If support holds, we may see a rebound. If it breaks, lower levels could come into view fast. Either way, Dogecoin is at a make‑or‑break moment—and everyone will be listening for the next big clue.

2025-06-19T00:02:00,"Crypto price predictions: Bubblemaps, AERO, Sei","The crypto market remained on edge on Thursday morning amid reports that the Trump administration was about to launch strikes against Iran, which may lead to a wider war in the Middle East. Bitcoin price remained below $105,000, while Ethereum was stuck above $2,500. XRP dropped slightly to $2.165, while the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped to $3.25 trillion. The crypto market performance mirrored that of the US stock market as the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 dropped by about 0.25%. This article provides a forecast for crypto tokens like Bubblemaps (BMT), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and Sei (SEI). Bubblemaps price technical analysis The Bubblemaps token has done well in the past few weeks, even as the crypto crash accelerated. It bottomed at $0.087 on June 11 and soared to a high of $0.1483 on Thursday. BMT token moved briefly above the crucial resistance level at $0.1370, the highest swing on June 6 this year. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top chart pattern, a popular bearish reversal sign. Bubblemaps token has moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It is hovering near the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) drifted upwards. BMT price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the Bubblemaps token price will likely continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $0.1895, up by 34% from the current level. A drop below the support at $0.13 will invalidate the bullish Bubblemaps forecast and point to more downside, potentially to $0.10. AERO price technical analysis Aerodrome Finance token has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past few weeks as it jumped to its highest level since February. AERO jumped as the volume handled on the network soared. Aerodrome Finance also jumped ahead of its integration with Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the US. This integration will likely boost its volume and revenues over time. AERO price rose above the key resistance level at $0.8010, the highest swing on May 10. This price was also the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern. It has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pointed upward. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at $1.3170, the 50% retracement level. A drop below the support at $0.8010 will invalidate the bullish view. AERO price chart | Source: TradingView Sei price technical analysis The SEI token has remained on edge in the past few months, even as its ecosystem growth accelerated. For example, it has become the second biggest player in the blockchain gaming industry with over 2.49 million unique active addresses (UAW). SEI price dropped from a high of $0.2747 on May 10 to $0.1832, its lowest point since April 22. The token moved below the key support at $0.2017, its lowest swing in August last year. Sei price chart | Source: TradingView Sei price has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Similarly, the RSI and the MACD have continued falling. Therefore, the token will likely drop to $0.2195, its lowest point in April, and then bounce back, potentially to the neckline at $0.2747.

According to the analytics platform, those holding onto Bitcoin between six and 12 months are abruptly locking in massive gains at a rate exceeding all other cohorts, raking in a $904 million profit on Monday. “Last week, we highlighted how BTC wallets that held greater than 12 months were the primary profit-takers. But that trend has now flipped. [On Monday]: less than 12 months cohorts accounted for 83% of all realized profit. Six to 12-month holders alone realized $904 million – the second-highest daily profit year to date.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode says the same six-to-12-month investor cohort netted more profits two months ago. “Mid-cycle buyers (six-12 months) stepped up on June 16th with $904 million in realized gains. That’s just behind the April top in terms of daily profits – and shows that Q4’24 buyers are now distributing heavily.” Source: Glassnode/X However, the analytics firm says that the selling of Bitcoin for profits is slowing way down for long-term BTC holders. “Meanwhile, greater than 12-month holders realized just $324 million, a notable drop from the relentless profit realization in May or even the last week’s peak of around $1.2 billion.

2025-06-19T00:00:04,"Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet","Bitcoin is navigating a highly volatile environment, as escalating Middle East conflicts and intensifying macroeconomic risks dominate global headlines. Despite mounting uncertainty, BTC continues to hold firm above the $104K level, signaling strong buyer interest at key support zones. Bulls remain in control for now, but hawkish macro conditions—such as elevated US Treasury yields, persistent inflation concerns, and geopolitical turmoil—pose serious risks that could drive BTC below the critical $100K mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching – Will History Repeat? The market is divided on what comes next. Some analysts point to strong fundamentals and institutional adoption as fuel for a massive bull run, while others warn of a deeper correction before any upward continuation. Top analyst Darkfost emphasized the importance of monitoring on-chain behavior during such periods of uncertainty. According to CryptoQuant data, realized profits on Bitcoin (7-day moving average) show no major warning signs. Current profit-taking activity remains below $1 billion—similar to levels seen following the October 2024 correction—indicating that investors are neither panicking nor overly euphoric. This muted profit realization could be a sign that long-term holders are still confident in the broader trend, setting the stage for an eventual breakout once macro conditions stabilize. On-Chain Metrics Signal Calm Bitcoin Consolidates As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, fears of a broader war—and the possibility of US intervention—continue to weigh heavily on global markets. Investors remain on edge, with rising oil prices and weakening economic confidence feeding into macro uncertainty. Yet, Bitcoin seems largely unfazed. Despite the heightened geopolitical tension, BTC continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, showing resilience that has both bulls and bears second-guessing their next move. Fundamentally, Bitcoin remains strong. Institutional adoption is steadily increasing, and exchange supply continues to decline, reflecting a trend toward long-term holding and off-exchange accumulation. In many ways, BTC appears to thrive in this environment of volatility and uncertainty. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits on Bitcoin—measured by the 7-day moving average (7DMA)—show no major warning signs. Current profit levels remain under $1 billion, a range not seen since the end of the October 2024 correction. Even during the recent ATH surge, realized profits stayed well below the January 2025 peak. This lack of aggressive profit-taking suggests that most investors are still holding strong, neither panicking nor rushing to sell. That restrained behavior is playing a key role in Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation. Without a wave of profit realization, there’s little pressure to force the market down—yet no catalyst strong enough to push it decisively higher either. Monitoring these on-chain signals will be critical in the coming days. If realized profits spike or exchange inflows surge, it may mark the beginning of a new phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack BTC Technical Analysis: Key Support Being Tested The 12-hour chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows the asset currently trading at $104,292, just above a crucial support level at $103,600. This area, which corresponds to the previous all-time high set in late 2024, has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. BTC has repeatedly bounced from this level in recent weeks, and its ability to hold could determine the direction of the next major move. BTC failed to break through the $109,300 resistance, forming a series of lower highs since tapping the $112,000 level. This suggests a weakening bullish momentum and highlights the importance of current price action around the 50-period SMA, which is now acting as short-term dynamic resistance. Volume has remained relatively stable but showed slight upticks during recent pullbacks, hinting at cautious selling rather than full-blown capitulation. The 100-period and 200-period SMAs, currently sitting at $104,065 and $94,617, respectively, offer additional support beneath the current range, with the 100-SMA now directly aligned with the horizontal $103,600 level.

2025-06-18T23:30:02,"Crucial Fed Economic Outlook: Persistent Inflation and What it Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Crucial Fed Economic Outlook: Persistent Inflation and What it Means for the Crypto Market The U.S. Federal Reserve speaks, and the financial world listens – especially the dynamic crypto market . While central bank announcements might seem distant from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings, the reality is that macro-economic policy, particularly concerning Fed interest rates and liquidity, has a profound inflation impact on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the Fed’s latest update and what its assessment of the economic outlook means for your digital asset portfolio. So, What Exactly Did the Fed Say This Time? The Federal Reserve recently concluded its meeting, offering insights into the current state of the U.S. economy and its policy stance. Here are the key takeaways: Growth Path: The Fed maintained its assessment that the economy remains on a steady growth path. This suggests resilience despite various global and domestic headwinds. Labor Market: The job market continues to be described as stable, with low unemployment figures. A strong labor market is often seen as a positive sign for consumer spending and overall economic health. Inflation: This remains the persistent challenge. Inflation is still above the Fed’s long-standing 2% target. This is a critical point as it directly influences monetary policy decisions. Data-Dependent Policy: The Fed reiterated that future decisions regarding interest rates will be heavily based on incoming economic data and evolving forecasts. This emphasizes flexibility rather than a predetermined path. Quantitative Tightening (QT): The process of reducing the Fed’s balance sheet continues as planned. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system is a key component of the Fed’s tightening policy alongside interest rates. In terms of forecasts, the Fed did make some adjustments: Metric Previous Forecast New Forecast (2025) GDP Growth ~1.8% (Hypothetical Previous) 1.4% PCE Inflation ~2.6% (Hypothetical Previous) 3.0% (Note: Specific previous forecast numbers were not provided in the source text, the ‘Hypothetical Previous’ are illustrative based on typical forecast revisions). The downward revision in the 2025 GDP forecast suggests a slightly less optimistic view on future growth, while the upward revision in the inflation estimate underscores the challenge of bringing prices back down to the target level. How Do Fed Interest Rates Really Affect the Crypto Market? Understanding the link between Fed interest rates and the crypto market is crucial for any digital asset holder. Here’s the simplified mechanism: Cost of Capital: When the Fed raises interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money. This increases the ‘cost of capital’ across the economy. Impact on Risk Assets: Higher borrowing costs and potentially lower economic growth prospects tend to reduce investor appetite for ‘risk assets’. Risk assets are investments perceived as having higher potential returns but also higher volatility, such as stocks (especially tech stocks) and, yes, cryptocurrencies. Discounting Future Value: Investment valuations often involve discounting expected future profits or value back to the present. Higher interest rates mean a higher discount rate, making future potential profits (like those hoped for in early-stage tech or crypto projects) worth less today. Opportunity Cost: Higher interest rates make safer investments, like government bonds or high-yield savings accounts, more attractive. This increases the opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like crypto, as investors can get a decent return with less risk elsewhere. Therefore, a central bank committed to keeping rates higher for longer to combat inflation can create a challenging environment for the crypto market , potentially leading to downward price pressure or sideways consolidation as liquidity tightens and risk appetite wanes. Is Quantitative Tightening Still a Headwind for Crypto? Absolutely. While rate hikes grab headlines, quantitative tightening (QT) is the Fed’s other major tool for withdrawing monetary stimulus. Here’s why it matters for the crypto market : Reducing Liquidity: During Quantitative Easing (QE), the Fed injects money into the financial system by buying assets. QT is the reverse – the Fed allows assets on its balance sheet to mature without reinvesting, effectively removing money from the system. Less Money Chasing Assets: A reduction in overall financial system liquidity means there’s less readily available capital looking for a home. This reduced pool of money can impact asset prices across the board, including cryptocurrencies. Bond Market Impact: QT also affects the bond market, potentially pushing up longer-term interest rates, which further tightens financial conditions. Think of it like draining a pool. Even if you stop adding water (rate hikes slowing), if you’re still actively removing water (QT), the overall water level (liquidity) continues to drop. This ongoing withdrawal of liquidity from quantitative tightening acts as a persistent headwind for risk assets, including the crypto market . What Does the Updated Economic Outlook Tell Us? The Fed’s updated economic outlook provides clues about their future policy path and the potential macro environment for the crypto market . The revised forecasts suggest: Slower Growth Ahead: The lower GDP forecast for 2025 indicates expectations of a moderation in economic expansion. While not predicting a recession outright, slower growth can impact corporate earnings, consumer confidence, and overall investment levels. Inflation Challenge Remains: The higher inflation forecast for 2025 is a strong signal that the Fed believes bringing inflation back to 2% will be a longer, more challenging process than previously hoped. Policy Implications: Persistent inflation combined with potentially slower growth creates a difficult balancing act for the Fed. It reinforces the likelihood that interest rates may need to remain elevated for a significant period to curb price pressures, even if growth softens. This scenario, often termed ‘stagflation lite’ or a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment, is generally not favorable for risk assets like crypto. The updated economic outlook suggests that the macro environment will likely continue to be a dominant factor influencing the crypto market for the foreseeable future, driven by the ongoing battle against inflation and the implications for Fed interest rates and quantitative tightening . What Should Crypto Investors Consider Now? Given the Fed’s stance and the prevailing macro conditions, what are the actionable insights for those navigating the crypto market ? Challenges Highlighted by the Fed’s Stance: Sustained Macro Pressure: Expect the influence of macro factors (inflation, rates, liquidity) to continue driving market sentiment and volatility. Reduced Risk Appetite: A ‘higher for longer’ rate environment tends to dampen speculative enthusiasm. Liquidity Constraints: Quantitative tightening means less easy money flowing into assets. Potential Approaches & Considerations: Focus on Fundamentals: In a challenging macro environment, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and sustainable tokenomics may outperform purely speculative assets. Long-Term Perspective: Recognize that macro cycles are temporary. Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific crypto projects rather than short-term price swings driven by Fed announcements. Risk Management: Revisit your portfolio’s risk exposure. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate the risk of investing a lump sum at a market peak. Diversification: While crypto is a specific asset class, ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic indicators and central bank communications. Understanding the macro backdrop is vital for making informed decisions in the crypto market . Inflation Hedge Debate: While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes touted as inflation hedges, their performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, heavily influenced by their status as risk assets sensitive to liquidity. Understand this nuance and don’t rely solely on crypto as your only hedge. This period requires a nuanced approach, balancing the exciting long-term potential of crypto with the realities of the current macro landscape shaped by the Fed’s fight against inflation and the ongoing quantitative tightening . Conclusion: Navigating the Macro Tides The Federal Reserve’s latest update confirms a picture of steady growth alongside persistent inflation, necessitating a continued tight monetary policy stance involving elevated Fed interest rates and ongoing quantitative tightening . This macro environment presents clear challenges for risk assets like those in the crypto market . While the Fed’s primary focus is on domestic economic stability, its actions have undeniable ripple effects across global financial markets, including digital assets. The updated economic outlook , particularly the revised inflation forecast, suggests that the ‘higher for longer’ narrative regarding interest rates may persist, keeping liquidity relatively constrained. For crypto investors, this underscores the importance of understanding the macro backdrop. It’s a time for informed decision-making, focusing on robust projects, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective rather than being solely reactive to short-term price volatility driven by macro headlines. Staying educated on how factors like inflation impact the broader financial system is key to navigating the current landscape successfully.

2025-06-18T23:05:27,"Trader Who Made XRP Millionaires In 2024 Releases New XRP Price Prediction","Michael XBT, a prominent market analyst known for his expertise in Bitcoin, has shared a new forecast for XRP’s price movement. He emphasizes that his previous projection, issued in mid-2024, delivered substantial returns and transformed ordinary investors into millionaires. July 2024 Prediction Delivered Exceptional Returns In July 2024, Michael identified a bullish technical chart signal , a breakout from a seven-year bull pennant formation, describing it as the most compelling setup he had encountered in cryptocurrency markets. At the time, XRP was priced around $0.50 and underperformed despite positive developments involving Ripple’s corporate deals. Many market participants dismissed the token, but Michael remained steadfast in his conviction. That conviction paid off. XRP surpassed the $0.50 resistance level by November 2024 and surged sharply to reach $3.40 in January 2025, representing a nearly 580% increase. This move marked a return to price levels not seen since 2018. The prediction earned respect from some previously critical voices, many of whom acknowledged the accuracy of Michael’s original call. Last year, I shared an XRP prediction that helped many ordinary people become millionaires. The cabal didn’t like it. They tried to stop me in various ways. Yesterday, I posted another XRP prediction.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they try to stop me again when it plays out. https://t.co/49ZsoVxT1E — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 16, 2025 Seven-Month Consolidation Marks a Pause Following the parabolic uptrend, XRP entered a consolidation phase that lasted approximately seven months. This period included a decline of over 50%, bringing the price down to around $1.60. Since that dip, XRP has mostly remained above $2. Michael interprets this behaviour as a healthy correction. He suggests it represents a period of accumulation and stability, setting the stage for the next upward move. According to him, XRP is now exiting this consolidation and preparing for a new rally. Bitcoin Breakout to Ignite Next Crypto Surge In his latest commentary, Michael shifts attention to Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin is nearing a breakout above an eight-year descending trendline. He believes that when Bitcoin finally surges past that resistance, its momentum will ripple through the crypto market and significantly benefit altcoins like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Michael cautions that this upcoming rally could be supported by what he terms a “generational wealth” event, which would draw wider investor interest. Although he does not specify XRP’s exact target, he suggests the movement could prove exceptionally rewarding for long-term holders. Potential Gains and Price Range Expectations Michael acknowledges possible resistance to this forecast but remains confident in its potential. He points to analyst projections that XRP might reach between $5 and $30 during this cycle. Even at the lower bound, investors holding 500 XRP could see significant gains. For example, if XRP climbs to $5, a holding of 500 tokens, currently worth approximately $1,000, could increase to $2,500, representing a 150% gain. Some in the community believe XRP could reach $100 ; however, Michael regards this as overly optimistic for the present cycle. Still, he notes that even speculative targets in this range would have a lasting impact on smaller positions. Michael XBT reiterates that his mid-2024 XRP call delivered transformative results and that he is prepared to repeat that level of accuracy. With XRP emerging from its consolidation and Bitcoin potentially breaking a significant resistance, he believes market conditions are aligning for a new round of significant price movement.

2025-06-18T23:00:29,"Bitcoin Stablecoin: Elastos Unleashes BTCD, Revolutionizing BTC DeFi","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Stablecoin: Elastos Unleashes BTCD, Revolutionizing BTC DeFi Are you ready for a major step forward in bringing stability to the world of Bitcoin DeFi? Elastos, known for its innovative work in decentralized technologies, has just unveiled a groundbreaking new asset: BTCD. This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s a Bitcoin stablecoin designed with robust mechanics to provide a stable dollar value, directly backed by BTC itself. What is the Elastos BTCD Stablecoin? Elastos has officially launched BTCD stablecoin , a digital asset pegged to the US dollar but uniquely collateralized by Bitcoin. Developed as part of their BeL2 protocol – a layer designed to bring Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into the DeFi space – BTCD represents a significant effort to bridge the gap between the world’s largest cryptocurrency and the need for price stability in decentralized applications. The core idea behind BTCD is to create a stable unit of account within the Bitcoin ecosystem without relying on centralized fiat reserves. Instead, it leverages the inherent value of Bitcoin itself, but with a crucial twist: significant overcollateralization. Asset Backing: Primarily backed by Bitcoin (BTC). Pegging Mechanism: Aims to maintain a stable 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Protocol: Launched on Elastos’s BeL2 protocol. Overcollateralization: Features a high collateralization ratio, reported between 160% and 200%. Why is a BTC-Backed Stablecoin Important for Bitcoin DeFi? Bitcoin, while the king of crypto in terms of market cap and security, is famously volatile. This volatility makes it challenging to use directly in many decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as lending, borrowing, or trading, where predictable value is essential. A BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD addresses this fundamental problem. Imagine trying to take out a loan denominated in BTC. If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of your loan decreases, potentially triggering liquidations or making the loan less attractive. Conversely, lending BTC means the value of your principal could fluctuate wildly. Stablecoins provide a much-needed anchor in this turbulent sea. By creating a stable, dollar-pegged asset derived from BTC, BTCD allows users to participate in DeFi activities on protocols like BeL2 using the value locked in their Bitcoin, but with the stability of a stablecoin. This unlocks new possibilities for yield generation, borrowing against BTC, and stable value transfer within the Bitcoin ecosystem, facilitated by Elastos. How Does BTCD’s Overcollateralization Work? One of the standout features of Elastos BTCD is its high level of overcollateralization, ranging from 160% to 200%. This means that for every dollar worth of BTCD minted, there is between $1.60 and $2.00 worth of Bitcoin locked up as collateral. This high ratio serves as a crucial buffer against Bitcoin’s price volatility. If the price of BTC drops, the collateral value decreases, but the high overcollateralization ensures that the system can absorb significant price swings before the collateral value falls below the value of the outstanding stablecoins. This mechanism is designed to enhance the stability and security of the BTCD peg. In systems with lower collateralization or reliance on volatile assets, a sharp price drop can lead to rapid liquidations and even de-pegging events. BTCD’s conservative collateralization ratio aims to mitigate these risks, providing a stronger foundation for its stability. The Digital Bretton Woods Vision and On-Chain Arbitrage CoinDesk reported that BTCD is designed to mimic a ‘digital Bretton Woods system’. The original Bretton Woods system pegged global currencies to the US dollar, which was in turn pegged to gold. In BTCD’s digital parallel, Bitcoin acts as the underlying ‘gold’ or reserve asset, and BTCD acts as the stable ‘dollar’ equivalent within the digital economy. Maintaining this peg relies heavily on on-chain arbitrage. Arbitrageurs play a vital role in stablecoin systems by profiting from small price discrepancies between the stablecoin and its peg. If BTCD trades slightly below $1, arbitrageurs can buy it cheaply and redeem it for $1 worth of the underlying BTC collateral (minus fees), pushing the price back up. If BTCD trades slightly above $1, arbitrageurs can mint new BTCD using BTC collateral and sell it on the market for a profit, increasing supply and pushing the price back down. This constant activity by arbitrageurs helps to keep the BTCD stablecoin trading close to its intended $1 peg, leveraging market forces directly on the blockchain. The BeL2 protocol provides the infrastructure for these on-chain operations. Benefits of BTCD for the Bitcoin Ecosystem The introduction of BTCD brings several potential benefits: Enhanced Stability: Provides a stable medium of exchange and store of value within Bitcoin-centric DeFi applications. Increased Capital Efficiency: Allows BTC holders to utilize their assets in DeFi without selling their Bitcoin, unlocking liquidity. Reduced Volatility Risk in DeFi: Makes lending, borrowing, and trading on BeL2 and potentially other compatible protocols more predictable. Strengthening Bitcoin DeFi: Adds a crucial building block needed for a mature and functional decentralized finance ecosystem around Bitcoin. Decentralization: As a BTC-backed stablecoin, it relies on decentralized collateral (Bitcoin) and on-chain mechanisms, reducing reliance on centralized entities compared to fiat-backed stablecoins. Potential Challenges and Considerations While promising, the launch of Elastos BTCD also faces potential challenges: Collateralization Management: Maintaining the required overcollateralization ratio requires robust liquidation mechanisms to handle significant and rapid drops in BTC price. Oracle Reliance: The system relies on accurate and timely price feeds (oracles) for Bitcoin’s value to manage collateral and liquidations effectively. Oracle failures or manipulation could pose risks. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of BTCD depends on gaining user adoption and sufficient liquidity on exchanges and DeFi protocols to facilitate efficient arbitrage and use. Smart Contract Risk: As with any DeFi protocol, there is inherent risk in the smart contracts governing the minting, burning, and collateral management processes. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin DeFi? The launch of a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin like BTCD on BeL2 is a significant development for the nascent Bitcoin DeFi space. For years, the vast liquidity and security of Bitcoin have been largely siloed from the rapid innovation happening in DeFi on other chains like Ethereum. Protocols like BeL2 and assets like BTCD are attempting to change this. By providing essential DeFi primitives – in this case, a stable unit of account – they pave the way for more complex and useful applications to be built, potentially unlocking billions in value currently held in inert Bitcoin wallets. This move by Elastos signals growing momentum in bringing Bitcoin’s power to decentralized finance. It’s a space to watch closely as more protocols and assets emerge to build out the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. Actionable Insights for Users For those interested in exploring BTCD and the BeL2 protocol: Research: Understand the mechanics of BTCD, including how collateralization and liquidation work. Evaluate Risk: Be aware of the risks associated with stablecoins (de-pegging, smart contract risk) and the specific risks related to volatile collateral. Look for Opportunities: Explore where BTCD is available for trading or use within DeFi protocols on Elastos/BeL2 to potentially earn yield or use it as collateral. Stay Informed: Follow updates from Elastos and the BeL2 team regarding the stablecoin’s performance and any changes to the protocol. Conclusion: A Stable Future for Bitcoin DeFi? Elastos’s launch of BTCD is a bold step towards building a more stable and functional Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. By leveraging Bitcoin’s security and value with a carefully designed overcollateralization model and on-chain arbitrage, the BTCD stablecoin aims to provide a reliable dollar peg within the BeL2 protocol. While challenges remain, the potential for a robust, BTC-backed stablecoin to unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin holders in DeFi is immense. This development could be a key piece in realizing the full potential of decentralized finance built around the world’s most secure blockchain.

2025-06-18T22:24:04,"AI Warns of Crypto Black Swan: Would Blockchains Survive Nuclear War?","ChatGPT’s o3 model was given data and an analytical framework to assess the potential black-swan fallout of a nuclear conflict on the global cryptocurrency ecosystem amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran over nuclear weapons concerns. The model’s core scenarios included both a wide-scale nuclear war and a more localized, tactical nuclear strike, which o3 suggests could immediately disrupt regional exchanges, nodes, and fiat on-ramps wherever the strike occurs. New AI Model Warns of Crypto Chaos in Nuclear Conflict Scenarios In a more severe scenario of widespread nuclear exchange, o3 warns that global internet backbones could be knocked out by electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), forcing transactions to rely on offline relays and satellite fallback systems. These projected disruptions are juxtaposed with real-time market moves observed during the recent Israel-Iran airstrikes . Bitcoin fell sharply late Thursday, sliding over 4% to $103,556 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran that intensified already fragile Middle East tensions. #Bitcoin #Iran https://t.co/ZCEtoEGUuB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 On June 12, for example, explosions in Tehran triggered a sharp reaction in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell by over 4% in 24 hours, from $106,042 to $103,053, before stabilizing near $104,370, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The total crypto market cap shed 3%, with Ethereum and Solana off about 7% and Dogecoin down 6%. Bitcoin crashes 3.3% to $103,556 as Israeli strikes on Iran trigger over $1.16 billion in crypto liquidations, marking the worst day since June with technical analysis pointing to further decline. #Bitcoin #Israel #Iran https://t.co/R6wNFZdHh0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 In the same 24-hour window, a massive crypto liquidation cascade destroyed over $1.16 billion in leveraged positions . It marked one of the most brutal trading days for crypto in recent months. As investors fled to traditional safe havens like gold and oil, crypto and other risk assets sold off aggressively. The scale and speed of the decline validated the AI model’s central thesis: that digital assets remain acutely sensitive to psychological and liquidity shocks during periods of extreme geopolitical risk. From Disruption to Breakdown: How Tactical and Full-Scale Attacks Could Disrupt Blockchain The threat of global war looms over economies as we head into 2025. Experts warn: crypto won’t be spared. #Bitcoin #Regulation #GlobalConflict #DonaldTrump https://t.co/dtQUFJZZFB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 4, 2025 In the case of a limited tactical nuclear strike, o3 noted that, “While regional exchanges, mining facilities, and fiat on-ramps could suffer outages, the global nature of blockchain infrastructure would help preserve core network functionality.” However, the psychological impact alone would likely be enough to trigger a rapid 15-30% decline across major crypto assets, worsened by panic-driven sell-offs and cascading liquidations. Short-term disruptions would be followed by a stabilization period, which depends on the extent of the physical and economic fallout. In contrast, o3 predicts that “a full-scale nuclear exchange, particularly one involving electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), poses a far more existential threat. EMPs have the potential to knock out large swaths of the internet and global power infrastructure.” In such a scenario, blockchain continuity would depend on the availability of satellite relays, off-grid nodes, and fallback communication methods, o3 wrote. While consensus mechanisms may technically survive in isolated zones, transaction delays, ledger fragmentation, and severe network degradation would be likely outcomes. In both scenarios, Bitcoin and other proof-of-work (PoW) networks would face vulnerabilities due to their reliance on high-energy mining infrastructure, often concentrated in specific regions. “Power outages or internet disruptions across key mining hubs could cripple network throughput and hash rate, leaving the system temporarily inoperable until redundancies are activated or grid power is restored,” o3 explained. Nonetheless, the decentralized nature of these PoW systems offers a glimmer of hope: as long as some nodes remain operational, full recovery remains possible. But proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum may hold a structural advantage in such crises. These systems consume less power and have more geographically dispersed validators, improving their chances of maintaining uptime and consensus. However, their dependence on oracles and off-chain data feeds introduces new vulnerabilities. If oracles fail, smart contracts across DeFi platforms could behave unpredictably, resulting in asset freezes, erroneous liquidations, and widespread liquidity failures. Resilience by Design: Why Decentralized Architectures May Outlast Centralized Systems Even more interesting, according to o3, systems built on decentralized architectures with built-in redundancy, such as satellite-linked nodes, solar-powered validators, and mesh relay networks, are more resilient than legacy exchanges or centralized finance platforms. Among the most promising are DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) networks. Unlike traditional blockchains that build a single linear chain of blocks, DAG-based systems allow multiple chains or paths to progress simultaneously. This structure can allow higher throughput and greater flexibility in times of fragmentation or node isolation. Some key DAG and other decentralized networks include: IOTA : Designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), IOTA uses a tangle-based DAG system where transactions validate each other. It eliminates miners entirely in exchange for lightweight, scalable infrastructure. Fantom (Opera) : A DAG-based smart contract platform built to handle high-speed transactions and low fees, often cited for its consensus mechanism (Lachesis) which allows asynchronous validation. Nano : A lightweight, fee-less cryptocurrency using a block-lattice DAG structure, where each account has its own blockchain. Its design supports instant transactions with minimal energy usage. Hedera Hashgraph : Though not a traditional DAG, Hedera uses a gossip-about-gossip protocol that enables high throughput and finality, popular among enterprise blockchain applications. Aleph Zero : A privacy-enhancing DAG chain focused on both performance and zero-knowledge proofs, often referenced in discussions around next-generation Web3 security. Alongside these, more conventional proof-of-stake (PoS) chains like Ethereum 2.0 , Polkadot , and Cosmos also rate highly for their validator diversity and lower energy dependence, key factors if grid stability becomes an issue. Meanwhile, stablecoins would likely face severe redemption pressure as fiat rails collapse and trust in issuer reserves erodes. Memecoins and speculative tokens would also almost certainly collapse. Lacking infrastructure, utility, or robust community organization, these assets are expected to shed nearly all their value in the face of systemic crisis. Conversely, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash could see a sudden surge in demand in a nuclear exchange. These tokens, built for censorship resistance, may serve as essential financial tools for people evading capital controls or seeking anonymity in wartime conditions. Crypto’s Real Test: Rising Inflows Clash with AI Warnings on Network Fragility Despite the turmoil, some signs point to crypto’s resilience, especially in less widespread and dramatic scenarios. Bitcoin ETFs have seen five straight days of inflows, even as the regional Israel-Iran conflict escalated, for example. Over $1.3 billion entered Bitcoin-linked funds in the past week, with $386 million flowing in on June 9 alone, according to Farside Investors . Some industry voices see this as evidence that crypto remains attractive during geopolitical stress, though o3 indicates that, under worst-case scenarios, tech and financial infrastructure would be severely tested. #Bitcoin Geopolitical Events Are Just Noise in the Long-Term Trend If you think new WW3 fears will be the end of crypto, you are mistaken. What do we see on the chart: Every red arrow marks a major war event since 2022. The pattern is crystal clear: Bitcoin doesn't care about… pic.twitter.com/rxv1CUYcmb — Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) June 13, 2025 “Flight to safety” behavior is still present, though the crypto market has been treated largely as a risk asset in the initial stages of the conflict. In a more severe scenario with actual nuclear weapons involved, the outcome is hard to predict. 99% are hedged expecting a war crash This is the perfect recipe for a bullish breakout of the 8-year line Everyone will be positioned for a dump and miss out on the major breakout That’s exactly what they want The perfect storm.. It’s called the 1% for a reason — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 18, 2025 However, there is a widespread narrative that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, may function as a hedge in times of global stress. Despite this, o3 introduces a counterpoint to this bullish narrative. The AI suggests that in the immediate aftermath of such a nuclear disaster, all cryptocurrencies would likely suffer violent selloffs as investors retreat to cash and traditional safe havens. Yet the model does not paint a uniformly bleak picture. As the initial chaos settles, functional differences between digital assets begin to matter. Cryptocurrencies capable of maintaining network integrity, either through decentralized validator sets, satellite node connectivity, or energy-efficient or more decentralized consensus mechanisms, may see relative recovery, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure has been degraded but internet access remains viable. Bitcoin, according to the projection, might demonstrate a degree of price resilience over other assets. Its wider distribution, simpler consensus mechanics, and historical credibility lend it a higher chance of partial survival, even under severe strain. In contrast, highly complex platforms or tokens reliant on off-chain services could falter amid infrastructure breakdowns and data feed disruptions. Regional divergence would become pronounced in such a scenario. In jurisdictions where financial systems collapse but online access endures, operational cryptocurrencies could even begin to substitute as the de facto financial infrastructure. Governments, meanwhile, would likely respond in disparate ways, creating a fragmented regulatory patchwork that influences which cryptocurrencies thrive or decline across different territories. In the long-term reconstruction phase, the AI model anticipates a profound revaluation of the digital gold thesis. Gold, the traditional hedge, would likely outperform all cryptocurrencies during the crisis onset, o3 predicts. But if Bitcoin’s network remains intact in at least part of the world, its utility and symbolism could allow it to rebound faster, perhaps even reinforcing its status as a cornerstone of a new monetary paradigm.

2025-06-18T21:53:53,"Bitcoin (BTC) Fever Spreads: DDC and Others Join the Corporate BTC Craze","Hong Kong-based DDC Enterprise has announced it has entered into three securities purchase agreements that could generate up to $528 million in gross proceeds, excluding placement agent fees and offering expenses. The capital raise features participation from institutional investors, including Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, Kenetic Capital, QCP Capital, and a network of prominent Bitcoin investors. Embracing Bitcoin Treasury Strategy According to the company’s official press release , nearly all proceeds will be used to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The funding includes a $26 million equity PIPE investment through subscription agreements with Animoca Brands, Kenetic Capital, QCP Capital, and notable individuals like Jack Liu and Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin Protocol. DDC said that it expects to issue up to 2,435,169 Class A Ordinary shares at an average price of $10.30 per share, with a 180-day lock-up period. Additionally, DDC has secured a $200 million equity line of credit with Anson, allowing the company flexible access to capital for Bitcoin accumulation, subject to future registration and market conditions. DDC isn’t alone in this approach; Fold Holdings is also pursuing a similar Bitcoin-focused capital strategy. The Arizona-based publicly traded bitcoin financial services company, Fold, has secured a $250 million equity purchase facility, which has granted it the option to issue and sell common stock at its discretion. The company plans to use net proceeds primarily to acquire additional Bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Utilization of the facility will be determined by SEC registration and other conditions. BitMine Immersion Technologies, too, has joined the wave of firms committing capital directly into Bitcoin holdings. The Nevada-based company announced completing Bitcoin purchases using the full $16.34 million in net proceeds from its recent stock offering. The company acquired 154.167 BTC at an average price of $106,033 per coin. CEO Jonathan Bates confirmed the move aligns with BitMine’s commitment to allocate 100% of the raised capital to building its Bitcoin treasury. Eyenovia Embraces HYPE in Treasury Strategy While Bitcoin remains the primary reserve asset for many firms, some are exploring emerging tokens to capture broader crypto exposure. Digital ophthalmic technology company Eyenovia announced a $50 million private placement to launch a cryptocurrency treasury strategy focused on the HYPE token, native to Hyperliquid. The company becomes the first U.S.-listed firm to hold HYPE in its treasury. Hyunsu Jung was appointed Chief Investment Officer and Board Member. If warrants are fully exercised, the transaction could yield up to $150 million.
