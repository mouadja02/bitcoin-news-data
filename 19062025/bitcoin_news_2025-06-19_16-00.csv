2025-06-19T13:57:00,"Bitcoin Price Trapped Between Key EMAs As Volume And RSI Reflect Market Indecision (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin consolidates as short-term EMAs compress the price into a narrow range. Volume weakens on Binance, aligning with neutral RSI to confirm indecision. Key breakout zones identified as the market awaits trigger for directional move. By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin price ( BTC-USD ) has been locked in a tight range over the past week, trading between the well-defined resistance at $108,900 and support at $103,000. As of the European session today, June 19, Bitcoin is hovering around $104,700, barely moving from its earlier levels in the Asian session. This consolidation reflects growing market indecision, particularly as price trades below short-term resistance and above firm support zones. The 20-day EMA currently stands at $105,790, just overhead from Bitcoin’s present level, while the 50-day EMA sits closer to the lower boundary at $103,000. This configuration is compressing price into a narrow band, forming a technical squeeze. The 50-day EMA reinforces the recent support level, increasing the likelihood that $103,000 holds firm in the near term unless significant momentum shifts. BTC price dynamics (May - June 2025). Source: TradingView Volume data adds another layer to the picture. Binance’s spot volume on Bitcoin declined yesterday compared to the last three trading days. This weakening in participation indicates a lack of conviction from both bulls and bears. It also aligns with the Relative Strength Index on the daily timeframe, which is parked near neutral territory. The RSI reading reflects a market that is yet to favour either direction, further validating the range-bound structure. Bitcoin technical squeeze continues amid rising Middle-East tensions On the 4-hour chart, a stack of EMA layers sits above current price levels. This implies any bullish breakout will face multiple layers of technical resistance, which could slow upward moves unless volume expands meaningfully. However, a successful breakout through this EMA cluster will likely test $108,900 and, if that level is cleared, extend to $110,500. A move toward the all-time high at $112,000 may follow if the broader market turns risk-on. On the downside, if Bitcoin fails to defend the 50-day EMA and drops below $103,000, immediate attention will shift to $101,000. This level serves as the next key support before the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold, which could trigger wider selling if breached. Until then, the price action suggests Bitcoin is in consolidation, caught between opposing technical forces and a muted sentiment environment as traders observe the conflict in the Middle-East. A decisive move outside this EMA boundary will set the tone for the next directional trend. Bitcoin stalled near $103,000 as compressed EMA blocked further upside . Fading volume and neutral sentiment pointed to weak conviction in the recovery.

Each day, coins marked as long-term storage grow larger compared to newly mined Bitcoins. For the first time, BTC held in long-term supply is growing faster than the supply of newly mined coins. More and more wallets are crossing the 10-year mark with no coins moved, adding to the increasing scarcity of available Bitcoin. The share of ancient supply as a percentage of total BTC supply is near a record, as older holders are unwilling to sell. | Source: Fidelity Digital Assets Satoshi Nakamoto is the original ancient whales While initially intended as electronic cash for daily payments, Bitcoin has turned into a reserve asset. In the past decade, BTC also developed its strong ‘hodl’ ethic, leading to the creation of multiple whale wallets with no intention to sell or move coins. This idle supply was added to the coins held in early miner wallets, including those of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is the first big holder of wallets older than a decade. Soon after that, the supply of early miners also joined that cohort, reaching new peaks in 2025. Currently, over 566 BTC on average move into the ancient supply category, surpassing the newly mined 450 BTC per day. Over time, a peak 17% or roughly 3.5M coins of Bitcoin supply is now in the long-term holdings of ancient whales, which may not enter circulation again. Over time, the coins locked in ancient stockpiles will only increase. Some of the ancient wallets are relatively small. Currently, there are only 93 wallets with over 10K Bitcoins, as even whales are trying to secure their assets on multiple addresses. More than 2M wallets have over 1,000 BTC . Ancient BTC whales show long-term conviction The ancient supply of BTC contains coins that are considered lost, forgotten, or unmovable for some reason. On very rare occasions, an old wallet will awaken and move or sell some of the coins. However, selling Bitcoins is seen as abandoning the long-term potential of the coin, especially at a time when corporate buyers are scrambling for a dwindling supply of BTC to be locked in treasuries. Bitcoin treasuries are newer, but also hold over 3.39M BTC, catching up with the ancient supply. Scarcity is also driven by other long-term cohorts, including wallets aged 7-10 years and those over five years old. Most of the flux of BTC holdings comes from the earliest wallet cohorts, created under three months ago, as well as from buyers realizing profits from the recent bull market. Some of the whale wallets are specifically engaging in trading, but the overall trend is for even more Bitcoin to become unavailable. Bitcoin daily transactions are at around 440K, near a 12-month low. Currently, on-chain activity is extremely subdued, while traders use the derivative markets to trade “paper BTC.” The expected supply crunch may start affecting the market, as new sources of Bitcoin and willing sellers are getting depleted. Even retail holders have already sold their coins, with significant outflows at much lower prices in the past year. Exchanges and OTC desks are also decreasing their available supply. Unmoved Bitcoin may continue to expand in the coming years, as even 500 BTC would be enough to set up a treasury company. Holders may never sell, instead tapping the value of their Bitcoin through various forms of staking, reserves, or lending.

2025-06-19T13:45:17,"GENIUS Unleashed: Trump’s Push Ignites Crypto Markets. What Are the Best Altcoins That Could Rally 100x","The crypto world is electric with the recent surge of momentum for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The landmark legislation , which cleared the Senate with a decisive 68-30 vote and is now headed for House approval, has been lauded as a transformative step for the digital asset landscape. President Trump himself has publicly thrown his support behind the bill, urging the House to approve it ‘ASAP – NO DELAYS’ and directly to his office. The powerful endorsement, coupled with the bipartisan Senate approval, could be interpreted by the market as a bullish signal for the entire crypto industry, catalyzing a possible rally. A Summer of Stablecoins: Market Responds with Explosive Growth The immediate aftermath of the GENIUS Act’s Senate passage saw a significant uptick in the valuations of crypto companies. Coinbase, listed on the Nasdaq, closed the trading day up an impressive 16.32% to $295.29. Even more striking was the performance of Circle, listed on the NYSE, which soared 33.82% to close at $199.59 . The rapid surge has led some in the crypto community to declare the arrival of ‘Stablecoin Summer’, as regulatory clarity is poised to unlock substantial institutional investment and wider adoption. The general impression is that GENIUS will be unequivocally good for the crypto market as a whole. The stage is set for a period of accelerated growth, with many investors now looking at the best altcoins that could rally 100X as Trump praises the GENIUS stablecoin bill and the ecosystem matures. 1. SUBBD ($SUBBD) – The AI Powerhouse for Creators The broader market optimism caused by the GENIUS Act is perfect for projects like SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which introduce significant technological innovation and address a market need. It’s well-positioned to thrive in this new era of crypto clarity. The $85B+ content subscription industry is ripe for disruption, and $SUBBD could lead the charge. The innovative AI creator platform is designed to empower both creators and fans by integrating cutting-edge AI creation tools and token-powered experiences. With an impressive combined following of over 250M across its ecosystem and ambassadors, and substantial benefits for token holders, $SUBBD is poised for mass adoption. As the first AI-integrated crypto creator/subscription platform, SUBBD offers a unique value proposition. Creators can leverage an AI assistant to automate tasks like chat, editing, and monetization, freeing them to focus on content. Meanwhile, users can generate realistic photos and short-form videos, approved by the original creator, fostering a deeper engagement. The ongoing presale offers early access and attractive 20% APY staking rewards. You can buy $SUBBD for $0.0557. We recommend getting in early, as we predict $SUBBD could reach $0.301 by the end of 2025, seeing a ROI of 440.40%. 2. Just A Chill Guy ($CHILL) – The Meme Coin for Vibe-Driven Investors In a market characterized by volatility and rapid movements, Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) offers a refreshing, laid-back alternative. This meme-inspired token gains traction by fostering a community around the viral ‘Chill Guy’ meme – a nonchalant character unfazed by life’s challenges. $CHILL aims to embody this ethos, providing a cool and engaging space for crypto enthusiasts. While many coins prioritize short-term hype, $CHILL distinguishes itself by focusing on strong community engagement and long-term potential, making it an appealing option for those seeking a more relaxed crypto journey. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the best meme coins will seek to carve out their niche by leveraging the widespread appeal of their underlying memes and cultivating a loyal following. $CHILL can be bought on all good exchanges for around $0.04955. 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Capitalizing on $BTC’s Ascent If you’re confident in Bitcoin’s inevitable climb to $1M and beyond, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an exciting and accessible entry point. Bitcoin remains the most talked-about crypto asset when it comes to market adoption, making headlines in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve back in March of this year. The institutional confidence and broader adoption bolstered by the GENIUS Act will see it gain even more attention, creating an even more favourable environment for Bitcoin-linked assets. $BTCBULL, a community-driven token built on the Ethereum network, is designed to let holders earn free $BTC and $BTCBULL tokens as $BTC surges. Unlike traditional $BTC investments, $BTCBULL allows anyone to benefit from $BTC’s rise without needing to own an entire coin. It’s the only altcoin that rewards holders and presale buyers with real $BTC, making it a standout. $BTCBULL’s unique mechanics are engineered for maximum holder benefit. As Bitcoin hits the $150K and $200K landmarks, $BTCBULL holders receive direct $BTC airdrops seamlessly integrated through its partnership with Best Wallet, one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets. Furthermore, the project operates a deflationary token burn mechanism, also at key $BTC landmarks, meaning the $BTCBULL supply is permanently reduced, increasing scarcity and value. You can buy $BTCBULL in presale for $0.00257. To make sure you don’t miss this $BTC linked opportunity, follow our how-to-buy guide . The GENIUS Act has undoubtedly stirred excitement in the crypto market, bringing a fresh wave of optimism and transforming investor sentiment to anticipation. The evolving landscape offers fertile ground for innovative projects, making both $SUBBD and $BTCBULL compelling options for those wanting to capitalize on the next wave of altcoin rallies in what looks to be a vibrant ‘Stablecoin Summer’ and beyond.

2025-06-19T13:44:19,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Ancient Wallets Hoard More BTC Than Miners Can Replace – Supply Shock Coming?","Bitcoin supply dynamics are tightening in a way we’ve never seen before. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, 550 BTC per day are now being classified as “ancient,” meaning coins untouched for over 10 years, surpassing the daily mining rate of 450 BTC. This marks a historic inversion in Bitcoin’s supply mechanics. Over 17% of the total BTC supply is now illiquid, and that figure could surge to 30% by 2026. BULLISH: Bitcoin Supply Squeeze COMING! ""Ancient"" bitcoin supply is growing faster than newly mined coins. Addresses that have held coins for 10 years or longer are now outstripping new supply. pic.twitter.com/D9Mk12gPB2 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 19, 2025 Ancient BTC holders rarely sell: net outflows occurred less than 3% of the time. After the 2024 election, even long-term wallets showed brief activity. Illiquid supply growth signals firm conviction despite price volatility. This imbalance between shrinking liquid supply and ongoing demand is laying the groundwork for what analysts call a structural supply shock. Institutions Gear Up to Absorb Millions of Bitcoins The demand side of the equation is equally compelling. Asset manager Bitwise estimates that inflows into Bitcoin will reach $120 billion by 2025, growing to $300 billion in a base case and $426 billion in a bullish scenario. That could absorb over 4 million BTC, nearly 19% of the total capped supply. What’s fueling this? Public companies and pension funds are slowly increasing their BTC exposure US states and cities are exploring treasury allocations Advisors on major platforms now offer 1–3% BTC model portfolios Despite $35 billion in sidelined interest due to compliance hesitations at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the institutional tide is shifting. With these players collectively managing over $60 trillion, even small allocations have significant implications. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Coils Near Critical Trendline On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is consolidating at $104,600. Price action is tightening along a rising trendline from the June 5 low. The 50-period EMA is sloping down at $105,381 and has been rejecting upside moves. The MACD lines are flat below zero, indicating a potential breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Levels to Watch: Support: $104,000 and $103,431 Resistance: $105,600-$105,800; above opens up $106,658 and $107,748 Bitcoin Trade Idea Longs look to confirm a breakout above $105,600 to $106,658 and $107,748 with a stop under $104,000—shorts below $103,400 to $102,200 and $100,449. Institutional flows are rising, and old supply is locking up BTC. Now, it’s time to see if price follows fundamentals or if volatility will shake out before the next leg up. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

2025-06-19T13:30:09,"Jerome Powell Attacked: Trump Launches Furious Blast at Federal Reserve Chair","BitcoinWorld Jerome Powell Attacked: Trump Launches Furious Blast at Federal Reserve Chair In the often-unpredictable world where politics collides with economic policy, recent comments from Donald Trump regarding Jerome Powell , the current Chair of the Federal Reserve , have certainly grabbed headlines. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these high-level economic and political tensions is crucial, as they can ripple through the broader US economy and influence market sentiment, including digital assets. Why is Donald Trump Attacking Jerome Powell? Former President Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to unleash sharp criticism directed at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . The language used was notably harsh, labeling Powell as “Too Late—Powell,” “the WORST,” and even “a real dummy.” Trump asserted that Powell’s actions were costing the United States billions of dollars. This isn’t the first time Trump has publicly criticized Powell. During his presidency, Trump frequently attacked the Fed Chair, particularly over decisions related to interest rates . Trump consistently advocated for lower rates, often clashing with the Fed’s mandate for independent monetary policy focused on stable prices and maximum employment. The recent attack also included Trump sharing an article that specifically called for Powell’s resignation. The article reportedly originated from sources associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, key players in the country’s mortgage lending sector. The Federal Reserve’s Latest Move on Interest Rates Adding another layer to this story, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the principal monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve , recently concluded its meeting with a significant announcement: interest rates would remain unchanged. This decision comes at a time when the US economy is grappling with various factors, including inflation concerns, employment data, and global economic uncertainties. The Fed’s strategy has been to use interest rates as a tool to manage economic growth and inflation. Keeping rates steady signals the Fed’s current assessment of the economic landscape, which appears to be at odds with Trump’s critical view. Key points from the Fed’s position: Maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate. Monitoring incoming economic data to guide future decisions. Aiming for maximum employment and inflation at the 2 percent longer-run goal. Acknowledging that economic outlook remains uncertain. Understanding the Impact on the US Economy Attacks on the Federal Reserve Chair and calls for resignation introduce political uncertainty into economic policy discussions. While the Fed operates independently, political pressure can still influence public perception and potentially market reactions. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates directly affect borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, influencing everything from mortgage rates to corporate investments. Lower rates can stimulate borrowing and spending, potentially boosting the US economy but risking higher inflation. Higher rates can curb inflation but may slow down economic growth. Challenges and Considerations: Balancing inflation control with economic growth. Navigating global economic headwinds. Managing market expectations regarding future rate changes. Maintaining the perceived independence of the Federal Reserve from political influence. How Does This Affect Crypto Investors? While seemingly a political squabble about traditional finance, tensions surrounding Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve ‘s policies have indirect but important implications for cryptocurrency markets: Macroeconomic Sentiment: Uncertainty in the traditional US economy can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, viewing them as potential hedges against inflation or economic instability. Interest Rate Environment: The Fed’s stance on interest rates impacts the liquidity in the financial system. Lower rates generally make riskier assets (like crypto) more attractive compared to lower-yield traditional investments. Higher rates can pull capital away from risk assets. Dollar Strength: Fed policy influences the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international buyers. Regulatory Landscape: Political pressure on economic institutions can sometimes spill over into discussions about regulating emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insight: Stay informed about the Federal Reserve ‘s announcements and general macroeconomic trends. While crypto markets have unique drivers, they are not entirely insulated from the broader financial system and political climate surrounding figures like Jerome Powell and Donald Trump . Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty The recent, fierce criticism from Donald Trump towards Jerome Powell highlights ongoing political tensions surrounding the leadership and policies of the Federal Reserve . Despite these attacks, the Fed’s FOMC has maintained its course, keeping interest rates unchanged in response to its assessment of the US economy . This dynamic interplay between political rhetoric and independent monetary policy creates a layer of uncertainty. For those involved in cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic signals and the potential impacts of political pressure on institutions like the Federal Reserve is vital for making informed decisions in an interconnected global market.

2025-06-19T13:30:00,"Iran Imposes Crypto Exchange Curfew After $100M Nobitex Hack","Iran’s central bank has imposed strict operating hours on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges following a devastating $100 million exploit on Nobitex, the country’s largest digital asset platform. The attack, reportedly carried out by a pro-Israel hacker group, has prompted a swift government response aimed at reducing the risk of further cyber intrusions. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the new curfew limits exchanges to functioning only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. local time. Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, recently stated that the move likely aims to contain the potential damage of future incidents. “Incidents are easier to triage if they’re not happening in the middle of the night,” he noted. The Nobitex hack occurred early Wednesday morning , during off-peak hours. Chainalysis also suggested that the Iranian government may be using the curfew to tighten control over citizen transactions, especially in a time of high geopolitical tension and the risk of capital flight. This is not the first time Iran has restricted crypto activity—last December, authorities shut down all exchanges temporarily to stabilize the rial. Pro-Israel Hackers Burned the Stolen Crypto The hacking group Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for infiltrating Nobitex’s systems and draining its hot wallets of major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana. Chainalysis reported that the stolen funds were sent to burner wallets—addresses with no private key access—effectively removing the assets from circulation. “This attack stands out not just for its size but for its motive,” Fierman said. “Unlike typical hacks motivated by profit, this one appears politically driven, intended to deprive the Iranian regime of access to funds.” Nobitex, which facilitates more than $11 billion in inflows—far surpassing any other Iranian exchange—has acknowledged the breach. In a statement on X, the platform said it has severed all external access to its servers and moved remaining funds from hot wallets to secure cold storage. Nobitex Struggles to Restore Access Although Nobitex claims the situation is under control, user access remains suspended. The exchange confirmed that its Reserve Fund will cover all losses incurred in the breach. However, it warned that ongoing internet disruptions and additional security protocols may delay the restoration of full services. As a key player in Iran’s crypto space, Nobitex’s compromise could have ripple effects throughout the region. Chainalysis highlighted its role in facilitating global crypto access for Iranian users—many of whom are otherwise cut off from international financial systems.

2025-06-19T13:20:06,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot ETH ETFs Record $19.1M on June 18","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot ETH ETFs Record $19.1M on June 18 Are you watching the crypto market, especially the developments around US spot ETH ETFs ? There’s exciting news from June 18, as these newly launched investment products experienced their third consecutive day of net inflows, bringing in a combined $19.1 million. This trend signals growing investor interest and provides valuable insights into the market’s sentiment towards Ethereum. Understanding the Significance of US Spot ETH ETFs Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch on why US spot ETH ETFs are such a big deal. These exchange-traded funds hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, offering traditional investors exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without needing to directly buy, store, or manage ETH themselves. This simplifies investment and opens the door for broader participation from both retail and institutional investors. The approval and subsequent launch of these funds in the U.S. are considered a major milestone for the crypto industry, similar to the impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. They provide a regulated and accessible pathway into the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially increasing liquidity and market maturity. Breaking Down the Latest ETF Inflows According to data compiled by Farside Investors, June 18 saw a solid performance for ETF inflows into the U.S. spot Ethereum funds. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: Total Net Inflow: $19.1 million Leading Fund (BlackRock’s ETHA): $15.1 million net inflow Second Leading Fund (Grayscale’s mini ETH): $4 million net inflow Other Funds: Reported no change in holdings for the day. This data highlights BlackRock’s ETHA as a dominant player early on, capturing the lion’s share of the day’s inflows. Grayscale’s mini ETH, which is a spin-off from its larger Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), also saw positive movement. Why Does a Third Consecutive Day of Inflows Matter for the ETH Price? Observing a trend is often more insightful than looking at a single day’s data. The fact that June 18 marks the third straight day of net inflows for Ethereum ETF products is significant. It suggests that the initial outflows from Grayscale’s primary ETHE fund, which often occur as investors arbitrage or switch to lower-fee options, might be stabilizing or being offset by fresh capital entering the ecosystem via these new ETFs. Consistent inflows can be interpreted as a positive signal for the market. It indicates sustained buying pressure through these investment vehicles, which could potentially have a positive impact on the underlying ETH price over time, assuming the trend continues and scales up. While $19.1 million might seem modest compared to some Bitcoin ETF figures, a steady stream of inflows builds confidence and liquidity. Comparing ETH ETF Inflows to the Crypto ETF Landscape How do these early Crypto ETF inflows for Ethereum stack up against the experience with spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows shortly after their launch in January, quickly accumulating billions of dollars in assets under management. Ethereum ETFs are still in their nascent stages, having received regulatory approval more recently and with actual trading expected to commence later. The current inflows, while positive, are smaller than the initial frenzy seen with Bitcoin ETFs. However, this could be due to various factors, including market conditions, the specific timing of their trading launch, and differing investor appetites for ETH versus Bitcoin exposure. The key takeaway is that capital is indeed flowing into the Ethereum ETF space, adding a new dimension to the overall ETF inflows narrative in the crypto market. What Potential Benefits and Challenges Do These Inflows Present? The emergence of significant US spot ETH ETFs inflows brings both opportunities and potential hurdles: Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Makes investing in Ethereum easier for traditional investors and institutions. Potential Price Support: Sustained buying through ETFs can add upward pressure on the ETH price . Market Legitimacy: The approval and adoption of these products by major financial institutions like BlackRock lend further credibility to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading volume and assets under management in ETFs can improve market liquidity. Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows can support prices, the crypto market remains inherently volatile, and ETFs are not immune to price swings. Competition: The ETF market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can still evolve. Grayscale Dynamics: Managing outflows from the existing Grayscale ETHE fund remains a factor influencing net flows across the ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum ETFs? The trend of positive ETF inflows is certainly encouraging for Ethereum proponents. As these funds become more established and potentially begin trading, we could see increased interest and larger capital allocations. The performance of BlackRock’s ETHA and other funds will be closely watched as indicators of institutional and retail demand. Continued inflows could provide a tailwind for the ETH price , but market-wide factors, regulatory developments, and overall economic conditions will also play significant roles. Investors interested in this space should monitor the inflow data, track the performance of individual ETFs, and stay informed about the evolving market dynamics. Compelling Summary The $19.1 million net inflow into US spot ETH ETFs on June 18, marking the third consecutive day of positive flows, is a clear indicator that investor interest in Ethereum through regulated investment products is growing. Led by BlackRock and Grayscale’s mini ETH, these inflows suggest increasing accessibility and potential support for the ETH price . While early compared to Bitcoin ETF performance, the trend is positive and adds a new layer of institutional and retail participation to the Ethereum ecosystem. As the market matures, tracking these ETF inflows will be crucial for understanding capital movement and sentiment in the crypto space.

2025-06-19T13:15:27,"Pro-Israel hackers deliver on threat to release Nobitex's source code","A pro-Israel hacking collective has followed through on its promise to release the full source code of Nobitex, Iran’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, just a day after orchestrating a high-profile blockchain exploit involving more than $100 million in digital assets. The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, also referred to as Predatory Sparrow , published a post on social media platform X on Thursday confirming the release of Nobitex’s internal data. “ Time’s up, full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN ,” the post read. Hacker releases blockchain script post $100 million exploit The leak, posted on an X thread, included components of the platform’s infrastructure such as blockchain scripts , internal privacy configurations, and a list of servers. Cybersecurity analysts say the disclosure effectively cripples the back-end security of Nobitex, leaving any remaining assets on the exchange vulnerable to further attacks. Time's up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN. بازمانده دارایی های شما در نوبیتکس هم اکنون در معرض دید و خطر هستند But before that, lets meet Nobitex from the inside: Exchange Deployment (1/8) pic.twitter.com/jiMfBpNXwd — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 19, 2025 The source code release follows through on threats issued a day earlier, when the group claimed responsibility for a coordinated attack across multiple blockchain networks. According to the statement, the group’s motivation stemmed from Nobitex’s alleged role in assisting the Iranian government in bypassing international sanctions . They labeled the exchange as “the regime’s favorite sanctions violation tool.” Predatory Sparrow has taken credit for other cyberattacks in recent days, including one targeting Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah. $100M in crypto burned, not stolen On Wednesday, blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis and Elliptic confirmed that approximately $100 million worth of crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, Tron, and Toncoin, were impacted in the heist. According to Chainalysis’s head of national security intelligence, Andrew Fierman, the stolen assets were sent to burner wallets, cryptographic addresses that the attackers cannot access. Analysts believe the funds were not stolen for profit but were instead destroyed to send a political message. “ The motive for stealing the $90+ million in funds is for something other than financial gain ,” Fierman stated, calling the act symbolic and destructive. Elliptic’s analysis also supports this interpretation, noting the use of provocatively named vanity wallets such as “1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX” and “DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t.” These addresses appear to have been created with brute-force generators and lack recoverable private keys, likely a deliberate effort to make the funds irretrievable. Yehor Rudytsia, a security researcher at blockchain firm Hacken, said the choice of wallet addresses used in the attack was more “political” than a typical financial theft. “ The wallet names and behavior suggest a political statement rather than a financially motivated theft ,” Rudytsia said. He added that most of the assets, over 20 different tokens on EVM-compatible chains, were sent to clean burner addresses. “ The only potential for partial recovery lies with Tether, which could reissue the $55 million in stolen USDT ,” he explained. Nobitex responded to the developments on Thursday, saying that no additional losses occurred following the data leak. The exchange announced plans to restore services within five days, although ongoing internet disruptions inside Iran may slow recovery efforts. Exchange linked to Iranian military and militant groups The hacker has claimed Nobitex is connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a military organization designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canada. Research by Elliptic has previously linked Nobitex to ransomware operatives sanctioned for ties to the IRGC, and individuals with close affiliations to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Blockchain data also shows transactional activity between Nobitex wallets and accounts connected to groups including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Yemen’s Houthi movement.

2025-06-19T13:00:56,"Bitcoin Is The Purest AI Trade, Says Wall Street Veteran","Macro investor Jordi Visser has published a Substack essay arguing that Bitcoin is “the purest AI trade,” a claim he says has followed him “in nearly every one of my videos, Substack posts, and conversations with Anthony Pompliano.” The piece, released yesterday under the title You Don’t Find Bitcoin, Bitcoin Finds You: Why It’s the Purest AI Trade, sets out a personal and macro-economic narrative that Visser believes binds artificial-intelligence disruption to the rise of the world’s first decentralised digital asset. Visser, who now heads AI Macro Nexus Research at 22V Research after three decades trading derivatives at Morgan Stanley, running a global-macro hedge fund, and ultimately serving as president and CIO of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, frames the essay as a pre-emptive answer to critics who “don’t see it or understand it.” “This statement wasn’t born from a single insight but rather a journey that unfolded across three distinct steps and four accelerating forces that helped me connect the dots between monetary policy, exponential innovation, and a world shifting faster than our corporate, financial, and government systems can handle,” he writes. The three steps, he explains, were “personal awakening, macro-economic context, and the recognition of Bitcoin as foundational infrastructure for the digital economy.” Why Bitcoin Is The Ultimate AI Trade The four forces Visser identifies as central to his thesis span the domains of monetary policy, technology, and sovereignty. The first, he writes, is “unprecedented fiscal and monetary intervention which I believe marked the final climax of the global government debt super-cycle and ultimately the dollar as the global reserve currency.” In his view, the pandemic-era explosion in government spending exposed the limits of fiat systems propped up by central bank liquidity. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet—Analyst Says Time Holds The Key The second force centers on structural deflation: “deflationary pressure from exponential technologies.” Visser sees AI and automation as not just economic disruptors but forces that drive prices downward across the board—pressuring legacy systems built on perpetual inflation and debt. The third pillar of his argument is institutional erosion. “Accelerating institutional obsolescence through AI,” he warns, will hollow out bureaucracies and corporate incumbents that are too slow to adapt to exponential change. Finally, Visser cites “Bitcoin’s emergence as a sovereign digital asset—independent, decentralised, and not defined by any nation-state.” In contrast to fiat currencies reliant on state power and monetary intervention, Bitcoin exists as an autonomous, verifiable infrastructure layer for the digital economy. Visser dates his “personal awakening” to early 2021, when the pandemic-era money print collided with a household epiphany: “Asset prices jumped and crypto prices were rising daily, and I was struck by the fact that my 13-year-old son … could explain the space in a way that I could not understand.” That curiosity pushed him toward Michael Saylor’s corporate-treasury bet on Bitcoin and Paul Tudor Jones’s description of the asset as “the fastest horse in the race,” convincing him that “Bitcoin [was] a rational response to an irrational system looking for a new one.” The second intellectual milestone came through Jeff Booth’s book The Price of Tomorrow, from which Visser lifts the line: “Innovation is always deflationary for the economy so the baseline for inflation is always negative.” Booth’s argument, he says, revealed “an Economic Trilemma” in which a debt-laden industrial economy can only survive by tapping government balance-sheets, even as a capital-light digital economy accelerates away. The result, he warns, is a fragile fiat system propped up by “artificially low rates, quantitative easing, and fiscal stimulus” that cannot be maintained indefinitely. Visser’s third pivot came with Marc Andreessen’s 2014 essay Why Bitcoin Matters. Andreessen’s framing of the Bitcoin white paper as a monetary protocol—“on par with the creation of the internet itself”—convinced Visser to stop viewing Bitcoin as a challenger to sovereign currency and start seeing it as “the base-layer for a new, decentralised economic system.” Stablecoins, he concedes, may bridge fiat and crypto, but they remain “tethered to the very institutions they’re trying to outrun.” Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play—Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps The final, self-described “force” is AI itself: “For years, we’ve said software is eating the world. But now, AI is eating software and soon it will eat everything in its path.” He argues that intelligent agents will erode the scarcity premia that support most legacy assets, leaving Bitcoin—algorithmically finite and independent of any issuer—as “sovereignty at digital scale.” In one of the essay’s bleakest forecasts he writes, “AI will destroy everything eventually—not maliciously, but systematically. And the economic system we’ve built on top of scarcity, debt, and centralisation is not equipped to survive it.” Visser closes by channelling Saylor’s mantra—“You don’t find Bitcoin, Bitcoin finds you”—to explain why adoption is emerging first in the periphery: retail investors in emerging markets, smaller firms outcompeted by big-tech AI monopolies, and early-mover states such as El Salvador. “This bottom-up foundation is setting the stage for a future top-down capital rotation as FOMO and greed eventually force more and more of the doubters in,” he concludes. “That’s why Bitcoin is, in many ways, the purest AI trade—an opt-out of a system being reshaped by intelligence no one fully controls. At press time, BTC traded at $104,816.

2025-06-19T13:00:00,"Crypto Exchange Kraken Adds Bitcoin Staking Via Babylon as BTC Driven DeFi Picks Up","Crypto exchange Kraken has launched bitcoin BTC staking through a new integration with Babylon, as decentralized finance on BTC picks up. Babylon is a Bitcoin-native protocol that enables BTC to secure proof-of-stake (PoS) networks without leaving the blockchain. The service allows Kraken users to stake their bitcoin directly, locking it in a custodial vault on the native chain. The staked bitcoin is then delegated to PoS networks via Babylon, and rewards are paid in BABY, the token of Babylon Genesis, a bitcoin-secured Layer 1 , Kraken said. Bitcoin has historically been used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. The advent of novel security sharing protocols has made BTC staking a third native use case , bitcoin DeFi, for the world's largest cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin network is ""evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi,"" Binance Research said in a report in March. Only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large ""untapped opportunity,"" the report said. Binance, the competing crypto exchange of Kraken, also offers a bitcoin staking opportunity on its platform through Babylon . “With this launch, clients can earn a return on their BTC while also enabling emerging PoS blockchains to benefit from the economic weight of bitcoin in order to validate transactions and bolster the security of their networks,” said Kraken’s Global Head of Consumer, Mark Greenberg, in the release. The mechanism is fully on-chain, with staking governed by Bitcoin scripts and cryptographic safeguards to deter malicious behavior. Users can unstake at any time, with around a 7-day unbonding period. The crypto exchange first introduced custodial staking in 2019.

2025-06-19T13:00:00,"Project Eleven Raises $6M to Defend Bitcoin From the Coming Quantum Threat","Project Eleven has raised $6 million to protect bitcoin BTC from the existential threat of quantum computing, as fears mount that the network’s core cryptography could one day be rendered obsolete. The round was co-led by Variant Fund and Quantonation, with participation from Castle Island Ventures alongside founding investors Nebular and Formation, according to a release. ""As quantum computing capabilities advance, the threat to systems like Bitcoin is no longer theoretical, it's imminent,"" Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, said in a release. ""This funding allows us to stay ahead of that curve, building the tools, standards, and ecosystem required to ensure digital assets remain secure in a post-quantum world,” Pruden said. Earlier this year, Project Eleven launched the Q-Day Prize, offering 1 BTC to the first team that can break Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using a quantum computer. “We define Q-Day as the moment when quantum computers become capable of breaking the elliptic-curve cryptography that secures private keys used by Bitcoin,” said Conor Deegan, co-founder and VP of Engineering at Project Eleven in a release. Project Eleven also announced it is launching Yellowpages a post-quantum cryptographic registry where users can generate hybrid key pairs, create proofs linking them to their existing BTC addresses, and timestamp those proofs on a verifiable ledger. Yellowpages works by having users generate a new key pair using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based systems, that are resistant to the types of attacks a future quantum computer could launch. They then create a cryptographic proof linking this quantum-safe key to their existing BTC address. That proof is timestamped and stored in Yellowpages, a public registry hosted off-chain. It doesn’t move funds or alter anything on the Bitcoin blockchain, but creates a verifiable paper trail of wallet ownership that could serve as a fallback if elliptic curve cryptography is ever broken. “Preparing ahead of Q-Day means ensuring that digital assets remain secure and verifiable in a post-quantum world. With Yellowpages, we’re giving users free, audited, and open-source tools to proactively establish quantum-resilient ownership today,” Deegan continued. Securing BTC against quantum through consensus The approach contrasts with solutions like QRAMP , a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that mandates a hard-fork migration to quantum-safe addresses. While effective in theory, QRAMP and similar proposals face a high barrier to adoption because they would require consensus, a tall order in a governance environment known for caution. Ethereum’s multi-year journey to Proof-of-Stake and Bitcoin’s recent OP_RETURN debate are reminders of just how slow protocol change can be, and some analysts have warned that the slow governance process is a threat itself. This route would bypass the need for consensus, while also facilitating the mass adoption of quantum defenses. As Rick Maeda of Presto Research recently warned in an interview with CoinDesk , quantum defenses must be built linearly, not reactively, because by the time the threat is real, it’s already too late. Project Eleven’s latest moves suggest some in the crypto industry are taking this threat seriously while acknowledging the weakness of current methods.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/06/19/project-eleven-raises-6m-to-defend-bitcoin-from-the-coming-quantum-threat,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|RESEARCH","Tech|btc|quantum computing|Fundraise|News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin narratives converge in the latest funding round. On Thursday, June 18, BitVault secured a $2 million investment to build a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin. The bvUSD stablecoin will launch on Katana, a new chain incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR. GSR is also a strategic investor in the venture, along with Gemini, Auros, and Keyrock. The funding round came amid rising interest in stablecoins, especially after the Genius Act passed the U.S. Senate. With the regulatory clarity introduced by the Genius Act, major banks and tech firms are now considering launching their own stablecoins. However, unlike fiat-backed assets such as USDC, bvUSD will be backed by Bitcoin reserves. You might also like: Every bank will issue a stablecoin after GENIUS Act passage: Alchemy CTO BitVault leverages Bitcoin for DeFi The creation of a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin is aimed in part at unlocking BTC’s liquidity for the DeFi ecosystem. Specifically, the protocol will enable yield generation with staked bvUSD, supported by crypto arbitrage strategies. “Bitcoin was built for moments of fracture. BitVault was built to make it usable,” said Michael Kisselgof, Core Contributor of BitVault and VaultCraft. “We specifically onboarded GSR, Auros, and Keyrock as strategic investors that can also execute high yielding, non-directional strategies to create demand and deep liquidity for BTC-backed money.” According to GSR, an investor in BitVault, the stablecoin venture holds significant potential for the Katana ecosystem. “We’re seeing growing interest in BTC-backed stablecoins, especially those designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems,” said Alain Kunz, Director of GSR. “BitVault adds to Katana’s evolving ecosystem by introducing a new layer of stablecoin utility, enabling BTC to take on a more productive role within Katana’s high-yield DeFi stack.” BitVault is a fork of Liquity V2, launched for institutional use in agreement with Liquity AG. The protocol features a permissioned borrowing layer, combined with core DeFi features.

On June 19, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission announced plans to conduct a fact-finding investigation into transaction fees charged by domestic crypto exchanges, as initially reported the Herald Economy. In a policy briefing to the Presidential Transition Committee, the FSC stated it would examine the current fee structures, methods of fee collection, and revenue from transaction fees at major exchanges such as Bithumb, Upbit, and Coinone. The goal is to evaluate whether current fees pose an excessive burden on consumers and consider appropriate regulatory measures.

2025-06-19T12:50:43,"Bold Move: BD Multimedia Boosts Bitcoin Treasury with $1.14M Convertible Bonds","BitcoinWorld Bold Move: BD Multimedia Boosts Bitcoin Treasury with $1.14M Convertible Bonds In a significant move signaling the continued convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, French payment solutions provider BD Multimedia has announced a strategic maneuver aimed squarely at strengthening its Bitcoin Treasury . The company revealed via an announcement on X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully issued €1 million, equivalent to approximately $1.14 million, in convertible bonds. But this isn’t just any standard financial transaction; the entire proceeds from this issuance are earmarked for one specific purpose: the direct purchase of Bitcoin (BTC). What Are Convertible Bonds and Why Use Them for a Bitcoin Treasury ? Let’s break down the financial instrument at play here. Convertible bonds are a type of debt security that the holder can convert into a specified number of common stock shares or other equity of the issuing company during a specified period. In simpler terms, it’s like a loan to the company, but instead of just getting their money back with interest, the lender has the option to swap their debt holding for company shares if they believe the stock price will increase. They offer investors potential upside (if the stock rises) while providing the safety of a bond (fixed payments and principal return if not converted). So, why would a company like BD Multimedia use this mechanism specifically to fund a Bitcoin Treasury ? There are several potential reasons: Accessing Capital: Convertible bonds can sometimes be issued at lower interest rates than traditional bonds because the conversion option is valuable to investors. This makes it a potentially cheaper way to raise funds compared to taking out a standard loan or issuing regular bonds. Flexibility: It allows the company to raise funds without immediately diluting existing shareholders (as would happen with a direct stock offering). Dilution only occurs if and when the bonds are converted into shares. Strategic Asset Acquisition: By specifically tying the bond proceeds to BTC purchase, BD Multimedia clearly signals its commitment to Bitcoin as a strategic asset, potentially attracting investors interested in both the company’s core business and its exposure to cryptocurrency. Using this financial tool provides a structured way for the company to acquire a significant amount of BTC for its balance sheet, building out its corporate Bitcoin Treasury without solely relying on existing cash reserves or more dilutive equity financing. Who is BD Multimedia and Why Are They Buying Bitcoin? Based in France, BD Multimedia is known primarily as a provider of payment solutions and internet services. Their core business involves facilitating online transactions and offering various digital services. While perhaps not a household name on the same scale as a tech giant, their decision to allocate corporate funds to Bitcoin is noteworthy, especially coming from a traditional financial services adjacent sector within Europe. The ‘why’ behind companies buying Bitcoin for their treasury is a trend that gained significant traction in recent years, largely popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. The rationale often cited includes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin serves as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets due to its decentralized nature and finite supply. Potential Appreciation: Anticipating significant future price appreciation for Bitcoin, which could boost the company’s balance sheet value. Strategic Alignment: Signalling innovation and forward-thinking to investors and customers, particularly relevant for tech or payment-focused companies. For BD Multimedia , a company operating in the digital payment space, integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy could also align with potential future business opportunities involving cryptocurrency payments or services. Their decision to use convertible bonds specifically for this purpose underscores a deliberate and structured approach to building their crypto reserves. The Growing Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Institutional Bitcoin Adoption refers to the increasing embrace of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by large financial institutions, corporations, and traditional investment funds. BD Multimedia’s move, while perhaps smaller in scale than some of the headline-grabbing purchases by major corporations, is another data point in this significant trend. This adoption isn’t just about buying and holding BTC on a balance sheet. It encompasses a range of activities: Treasury Management: Companies holding BTC as part of their corporate reserves (like BD Multimedia). Investment Products: Launching Bitcoin ETFs, futures, or other structured products. Service Integration: Payment processors integrating crypto options, banks offering crypto custody. Venture Capital: Investing in blockchain and crypto startups. The decision by BD Multimedia to issue convertible bonds for this specific purpose highlights a creative financing method being employed to facilitate Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . It shows that companies are finding tailored financial solutions to enter the crypto space, moving beyond simple direct cash purchases. Crafting a Corporate Crypto Strategy : What Does it Involve? BD Multimedia’s action provides a real-world example of a company executing a Corporate Crypto Strategy . Building such a strategy involves much more than just deciding to buy Bitcoin. Key considerations typically include: Defining Objectives: Why is the company acquiring crypto? Is it for treasury management, potential appreciation, future business integration, or a combination? Asset Selection: Which cryptocurrencies to acquire? While Bitcoin is the most common for treasuries due to its size and recognition, some might consider others. Acquisition Method: How will the crypto be acquired? Direct market purchases, over-the-counter (OTC) deals, using specific financing tools like convertible bonds , or accepting crypto payments? Custody and Security: How will the acquired crypto be securely stored? This is a critical operational challenge requiring robust security protocols and potentially third-party custodians. Accounting and Reporting: How will the crypto holdings be accounted for on the balance sheet? This involves navigating complex and evolving accounting standards. Regulatory Compliance: Understanding and adhering to relevant regulations regarding crypto holdings and transactions in their operating jurisdictions. Risk Management: Developing strategies to manage the inherent volatility and other risks associated with cryptocurrency. For BD Multimedia , their strategy clearly involved using a specific financing tool ( convertible bonds ) to fund their acquisition of BTC, indicating a carefully considered approach to both financing and asset acquisition within their broader Corporate Crypto Strategy . Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury strategy, funded potentially through mechanisms like convertible bonds , comes with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages for a company like BD Multimedia: Potential Benefits: Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, the company’s balance sheet strengthens significantly without requiring profit generation from core business operations. Inflation Hedge: May protect the purchasing power of corporate reserves against inflation over the long term. Diversification: Adds a non-correlated asset (historically, though this can change) to the corporate balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation Signal: Positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in the digital age. Attracting Talent/Investors: May appeal to employees and investors interested in the crypto space. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can be extremely volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of the corporate treasury and potential impairment losses on financial statements. Accounting Complexity: Current accounting rules often treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, requiring mark-to-market adjustments only downwards (impairment losses), which can impact reported earnings negatively during price downturns. Gains are typically only recognized upon sale. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires sophisticated security measures to prevent theft or loss of private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view holding volatile assets like Bitcoin as risky or speculative, potentially impacting investor confidence. BD Multimedia’s use of convertible bonds adds another layer of complexity, requiring careful management of the bondholders’ potential conversion rights alongside the management of the volatile BTC asset. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Going Forward? The action taken by BD Multimedia , leveraging convertible bonds to fund their Bitcoin Treasury , serves as a practical illustration of how companies are finding innovative ways to participate in the crypto market. It suggests that the trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is not limited to the largest corporations or the most obvious tech companies. Smaller to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies from diverse sectors, including traditional financial services adjacent areas like payment processing, are exploring and implementing strategies to incorporate Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. The use of specific financial instruments like convertible bonds demonstrates a growing sophistication in how these companies are approaching their Corporate Crypto Strategy . While $1.14 million may not seem massive compared to multi-billion dollar corporate treasuries, every such move adds to the cumulative weight of institutional interest and capital flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class being considered by corporate finance departments, not just speculative retail investors. Actionable Insights from BD Multimedia’s Move For investors and other companies watching this space, BD Multimedia’s strategy offers a few key takeaways: Look Beyond the Headlines: Significant institutional adoption is happening at various scales and across different sectors, not just the biggest names. Understand the ‘How’: Companies are using diverse and sometimes complex financial tools (like convertible bonds ) to fund their crypto strategies. Understanding these methods provides deeper insight into their commitment and approach. Corporate Treasuries as a Growth Driver: The trend of companies building a Bitcoin Treasury remains a potential long-term driver of demand for BTC. Due Diligence is Key: For investors interested in companies holding crypto, it’s crucial to understand their specific Corporate Crypto Strategy , including their acquisition methods, custody solutions, and risk management practices. BD Multimedia’s decision provides a tangible example of how a company is actively managing its balance sheet to gain exposure to Bitcoin, highlighting the practical implementation of a Corporate Crypto Strategy in the current market environment. Conclusion: Another Piece in the Puzzle of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption BD Multimedia’s issuance of $1.14 million in convertible bonds with the explicit goal of boosting its Bitcoin Treasury is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a clear signal of intent. It underscores the ongoing trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and showcases how companies are leveraging specific financial instruments to execute their Corporate Crypto Strategy . While the amount may be modest compared to some other corporate holdings, this move by a French payment solutions provider highlights the broadening appeal of Bitcoin as a treasury asset across different industries and geographies. It reinforces the narrative that companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate component of a modern corporate balance sheet strategy, potentially offering benefits like inflation hedging and long-term value appreciation, despite the inherent volatility and challenges.

Apologies for any confusion caused by the clowns who temporarily took over our account. — a16z (@a16z) June 18, 2025 The a16z breach represents just the latest incident in an escalating wave of cryptocurrency-focused social media attacks that have targeted everyone from venture capital firms to government officials throughout 2025. a16z X Account Hackers: The Anatomy of a Modern Crypto Hack Campaign The a16z attack follows a sophisticated playbook that has become increasingly common among crypto-focused cybercriminals. It involves creating fake tokens paired with authoritative announcements from compromised high-profile accounts. After taking over the account, the hackers crafted messages that mimicked legitimate corporate communications while including technical details like contract addresses to enhance credibility. The choice to target a16z is strategic, as the venture capital firm’s endorsement of any crypto project would carry significant weight given their reputation as kingmakers in the space. The broader pattern of attacks reveals coordinated efforts targeting various segments of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, from government officials to media outlets to development teams. Paraguay says @SantiPenap ’s account was hacked to falsely announce Bitcoin Legal Tender and solicit BTC. @PresidenciaPy has confirmed the post is fake and investigators are working with X security. #Bitcoin #Paraguay #Cybersecurity https://t.co/yduO5vGW9k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 Most recently, Paraguay President Santiago Peña’s account was compromised . It falsely announced Bitcoin adoption and included requests for users to send Bitcoin to determine the “national rollout scale.” Similarly, the ZKsync breach combined fake regulatory warnings with phishing attempts , as the hackers layered multiple attack vectors to maximize market manipulation and direct theft opportunities. The technical execution of these attacks often involves compromised delegated accounts or sophisticated phishing operations that bypass two-factor authentication, as evidenced by Watcher.Guru’s breach despite their “extreme measures” to prevent such incidents. The cross-platform nature of modern social media operations means that a single account compromise can automatically propagate fraudulent content across multiple channels. This interconnected vulnerability explains why even brief compromises can generate substantial trading volumes and market movements before being detected and reversed. Escalating Security Crisis Across Crypto Social Media The frequency and sophistication of cryptocurrency-focused social media attacks have reached crisis levels. In February 2025 alone, crypto ecosystem losses increased by 20x month-over-month to over $1.5 billion across just nine major incidents. Over $180M was stolen in March, $92M in April , and $302M in May . In Q1 alone, over $1.64 billion was recorded in the first three months of 2025 , although most resulted from only two hacks of two centralized exchanges, Bybit’s $1.46 billion hack and Phemex’s $69.1 million hack . A recent report also shows that Ethereum remains the most targeted chain, with over $1.5B recorded in Q1. Source: MartyParty on X The attacks have evolved from simple phishing attempts to complex market manipulation schemes that combine fake regulatory announcements, fraudulent airdrops, and pump-and-dump token launches. The targeting of prominent figures extends beyond cryptocurrency-specific accounts to include luxury brands like Dior, whose Instagram account was used to promote fake Solana tokens, and news outlets like the New York Post . The pattern suggests organized groups with sophisticated technical capabilities and detailed knowledge of the cryptocurrency market’s information dependencies. These groups consistently target accounts whose endorsements would carry maximum credibility and market impact.

2025-06-19T12:37:22,"Bitcoin Price Eyes Bullish Breakout as Fed Holds Rates Steady, Says CryptoQuant","Bitcoin could be preparing for a bullish breakout following the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, according to a new report from onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin is showing bullish signs as the Fed holds interest rates steady, historically a positive macro signal. CryptoQuant highlights a divergence between stable BTC price and falling open interest, suggesting a healthy market reset. Growing ask liquidity near $106K raises the potential for a short squeeze if momentum builds. In a June 19 post , CryptoQuant pointed to emerging tailwinds for BTC after the Fed’s June 18 policy meeting, where officials unanimously voted to pause further hikes. Historically, such pauses have benefited Bitcoin, and analysts believe 2025 may offer favorable conditions for risk assets. CryptoQuant Flags Divergence Between Bitcoin Price and Open Interest on Binance CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha highlighted trading data from Binance showing diverging trends between BTC price and open interest (OI). “BTC has formed consistent equal lows slightly above $104,000. This level has acted as a strong demand zone, repeatedly absorbing sell pressure,” Taha wrote. At the same time, open interest on Binance has been making lower lows, suggesting a steady round of deleveraging in the derivatives market. This type of shakeout, price holding while OI declines, is often seen as a signal that weaker positions are being cleared, potentially paving the way for more stable upward movement. “The timing of this cleanup coincides with the Fed’s decision to pause rate hikes — a macroeconomic signal that often acts as a tailwind for risk-on assets like Bitcoin,” the firm noted. Speaking after the Fed kept interest rate unchanged, Powell kept it cool and cautious: no hawkish or dovish tilt. Just a “wait and see” vibe amid rising uncertainty. Markets took it calmly. But as open interest is dropping while $BTC holds above demand, bears might be running… pic.twitter.com/5gsK5QTwPY — COIN360 (@COIN360com) June 19, 2025 In past cycles, Bitcoin has shown bullish behavior following rate stabilization , especially when open interest fades and liquidation activity slows. That backdrop, paired with strong price support, gives analysts reason to watch closely for upside movement. Data from CoinGlass adds to the bullish narrative. The platform reports growing ask liquidity near the $106,000 level, which could trigger a short squeeze if buying accelerates. While BTC continues to trade in a narrow range, the combination of macro stability and onchain cleanup suggests a potential shift in momentum may be approaching. Bitcoin is in the Consolidation Phase Bitcoin is consolidating just below the $105,000 mark , trading around $104,900 at the time of writing. The price action suggests a neutral-to-slightly bullish setup, supported by tight Bollinger Bands and steady RSI values. On the 2-hour chart, BTC has maintained higher lows near $104,000, forming a consistent demand zone. RSI is hovering near 48, indicating balanced momentum with no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. MACD, while still negative, shows signs of flattening, hinting at a possible shift in short-term trend. The 30-minute chart reinforces this view, with RSI near 51 and MACD showing a modest positive crossover. Bollinger Bands remain relatively tight, suggesting price is coiling ahead of a potential move. In the 1-minute chart, short-term momentum remains weak. RSI at 38.26 and a flat MACD reflect lackluster intraday interest. Price is compressing between $104,864 and $104,999, with minimal volatility during the observed period. Overall, BTC appears to be in a consolidation phase with a bullish bias. A decisive break above $105,500 could signal momentum toward $107K, while holding $104K remains key for bullish continuation. Short squeeze potential may increase if spot volume rises near resistance levels.

2025-06-19T12:30:09,"The Pacific island nation of Nauru passes crypto legislation","The Republic of Nauru, a remote island nation in the western Pacific Ocean, has passed a law that could transform the country into a regional hub for crypto, digital banking, and Web3 innovation. On Tuesday, Nauru’s Parliament approved a bill establishing the Command Ridge Virtual Asset Authority (CRVAA), a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing virtual asset services and enforcing the country’s licensing framework. The bill is Nauru’s most significant move yet toward institutionalizing digital finance. CRVAA to oversee digital asset services Named after the island’s highest elevation, the Command Ridge Virtual Asset Authority will become the primary regulatory authority for all digital asset-related activities in the country. According to the government statement issued on July 17, the CRVAA will license and supervise virtual asset service providers (VASPs), digital banking operations, and Web3 services. The new law covers both centralized and decentralized digital finance ecosystems. Activities subject to CRVAA authorization include the operation of exchanges, custodial and non-custodial wallet services, token issuance through ICOs and STOs, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lending and staking protocols, DeFi platforms, and stablecoin issuance. It also extends to digital banking operations, cross-border payments, and the issuance and management of electronic money. With the legislation in place, companies licensed under CRVAA will be allowed to operate globally while using Nauru as their jurisdictional base. Minister Eoe: Nauru is competitive in the digital economy Commerce and Foreign Investment Minister Maverick Eoe presented the bill to lawmakers and framed it as a calculated bid to compete globally. He said the law introduces a framework that puts Nauru in the list of “forward-thinking countries” already generating revenue through virtual assets and digital innovation. “ More countries are recognizing the potential of virtual assets from blockchain technologies to decentralized finance ,” Eoe reckoned. “ This bill proposes to introduce a framework that will put Nauru on par with other countries leading in the development of their digital economies .” He added that the licensing system could attract international businesses, encourage investment, and stimulate local job creation through digital sectors. “ By regulating VASPs, token issuance, and secure digital transactions, we can position Nauru as a hub for these types of innovation and development within this part of the world ,” the minister surmised. The legislation, he continued, goes beyond compliance or legal frameworks. “ It is a commitment to the future prosperity of the country and a statement that Nauru does not fear the digital transformation, but embraces it and leads within the Pacific region ,” he concluded. Legal clarity for crypto in one of the world’s smallest nations Before the bill’s passage, crypto trading in Nauru was legal but lacked formal regulation or oversight. The new legislation now defines digital assets as commodities rather than securities. Payment tokens are explicitly excluded from investment contract status, giving legal certainty to blockchain applications. The small island country, measuring just 21 square kilometers with a population of approximately 12,500, is the third-smallest country in the world by area and the world’s smallest island nation . Nauru’s government is using its legislative flexibility to become a significant player in the global digital economy. President David Adeang described the law as a “leap toward economic modernization” and resilience. In his address following the bill’s approval, Adeang said, “ The law harnesses the potential of virtual assets to diversify revenue streams and fortify economic resilience. ” The president also mentioned that Nauru is among the Pacific’s most vulnerable nations, owing to its designation under the United Nations Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI), which tracks susceptibility to economic and environmental shocks.

2025-06-19T12:30:02,"Bitcoin Mood Hits April Low as Santiment Hints at Contrarian Rally","Crypto traders have been gripped by fresh pessimism as Bitcoin’s market sentiment plunges to its most bearish reading since early April. However, according to market intelligence platform Santiment, this very gloom could set the stage for an unexpected rally, echoing a familiar pattern where deep fear turns into the fuel for Bitcoin’s next push up the price ladder. Sentiment Mirrors April Lows Fresh data from Santiment shows that for the first time in over two months, bearish comments on social media slightly outnumber bullish ones, with a ratio of 1.03 negative takes for every positive one. “This is typically a bullish sign,” stated the on-chain analytics firm. The last time such a scenario played out, fears over new punitive tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration on numerous U.S. trade partners dragged BTC below $75,000. But while sentiment flipped sharply negative, the king cryptocurrency quickly rebounded once anxiety peaked. Pointing to that April low as a textbook example of contrarian signals, Santiment declared , “markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” This latest mood dip comes at a time when macro tensions are unsettling traders. Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. reported that European equity markets had opened lower amid mounting geopolitical risks, including possible U.S. military action against Iran. Furthermore, while the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, as had been largely expected, the news was delivered alongside a cautious outlook. The Fed upgraded its inflation forecast to 3%, cut its 2025 GDP projection to 1.4%, and is facing ongoing public criticism from President Trump, adding layers of uncertainty. Price Holding Steady Bitcoin’s price, hovering around $104,800 at this writing, reflects this stagnation, showing minimal reaction to the Fed remarks. The asset lost just 0.3% of its value in the last 24 hours, with the only sign of wear coming from a 2.8% drop over the past seven days, slightly worse than the broader crypto market’s 2% loss in that period. Adler expressed more pessimism, pointing out that Bitcoin, which is currently considered a risk asset, could face accelerated selling pressure if Middle East tensions worsen and trigger a flight to safer havens. Technical voices such as Ed_NL also warned that the asset could still revisit key lower levels, with a possible double correction pattern echoing the chop from the summer of 2024. Looking at the bigger picture, however, fundamentals remain supportive. On June 18, Fidelity reported that the ancient, long-unmoved Bitcoin supply continues to grow faster than new issuance, highlighting strong holder conviction despite near-term jitters. Meanwhile, institutional appetite is also showing few signs of cooling, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1.4 billion in fresh inflows over the past week.

2025-06-19T12:20:27,"Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet: What Low BTC Fees Mean for Miners","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transaction Fees Plummet: What Low BTC Fees Mean for Miners Have you sent a Bitcoin transaction lately? If so, you might have noticed something different: the cost was likely very low. Indeed, Bitcoin transaction fees have recently dropped to levels not seen since 2022. This significant decline has caught the attention of market observers and, more importantly, has a direct impact on the economics of the Bitcoin network, particularly for those who secure it. Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Fees and Miner Revenue Before diving into the specifics of the current low fee environment, it’s crucial to understand how BTC fees work and their role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. When you send Bitcoin, you include a small fee with the transaction. This fee is paid to the Bitcoin miners who include your transaction in a block they successfully add to the blockchain. Miners prioritize transactions based on the fee offered – higher fees usually mean faster confirmation times, especially when the network is busy. Miner revenue comes from two primary sources: Block Subsidy: This is the reward of newly minted Bitcoin included in each block. This subsidy halves approximately every four years (the halving event). Transaction Fees: The sum of all fees from transactions included in a block. Historically, the block subsidy has been the dominant source of income for miners. However, with each halving event reducing the subsidy, transaction fees are expected to play an increasingly important role in incentivizing miners to secure the network in the long term. Why Are Bitcoin Transaction Fees So Low Right Now? According to data cited by Decrypt from Luxor’s Hashrate Index, Bitcoin transaction fees have fallen to their lowest point since 2022. The data indicates that fees have accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward so far this June. This is a stark contrast to periods of high network congestion or intense activity. Several factors contribute to this decline: Reduced Network Congestion: The primary driver of high fees is demand for limited block space. When many people are trying to send transactions simultaneously, they bid up fees to get their transactions included in the next block. Currently, demand for block space is relatively low compared to peak periods. Decreased Activity from Fee-Intensive Use Cases: Periods like the surge in Ordinals or BRC-20 token minting significantly increased network activity and competition for block space, driving fees sky-high. The current pace of such activity is more subdued. Improved Network Efficiency: Ongoing adoption of solutions like SegWit and the Lightning Network, while still growing, can help reduce the average transaction size or move transactions off the main chain, easing congestion pressure over time. The current situation reflects a period of lower intensity on the network compared to the speculative frenzy seen during certain past cycles. The Impact on Bitcoin Miner Revenue This drop in BTC fees has a direct and significant impact on Bitcoin miner revenue . While the block subsidy remains the largest component of their earnings, the contribution from fees can provide a crucial boost to profitability, especially for less efficient operations or during times of high operational costs (like electricity). Consider the revenue structure: Total Miner Revenue = Block Subsidy + Total Transaction Fees in Block When transaction fees represent less than 1% of the total block reward, it means miners are relying almost entirely on the block subsidy (currently 3.125 BTC per block after the latest halving). This makes their profitability highly sensitive to the price of Bitcoin and their operational expenses. For miners, this presents a challenge: Lower Profit Margins: With fees contributing minimally, the margin between the cost of mining (electricity, hardware, cooling, facility) and the revenue earned shrinks. Increased Pressure on Efficiency: Less profitable periods force miners to upgrade to more efficient hardware (ASICs) and seek out the lowest possible electricity costs to remain competitive. Potential for Consolidation: Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to stay afloat, potentially leading to consolidation within the industry. This isn’t the first time fees have been low, and it highlights the dynamic nature of Bitcoin mining economics. Miners are accustomed to fluctuating revenue streams, but extended periods of low fees add considerable pressure. Comparing Current Crypto Transaction Costs From a user perspective, the low crypto transaction costs on the Bitcoin network are a positive development. Sending BTC is currently cheaper and faster than it might be during peak congestion times. This makes smaller transactions more viable and improves the overall user experience for transferring value on the base layer. How do current Bitcoin fees compare to other cryptocurrencies? While direct comparisons can be complex due to different network designs and fee mechanisms, Bitcoin’s base layer fees can still become very high during peak demand. However, in the current low-congestion environment, Bitcoin transaction costs are competitive, often cheaper than sending assets on some other popular blockchains that might be experiencing higher activity or have different fee structures. It’s a reminder that the “cost” of using a blockchain isn’t static; it’s a market price determined by supply (block space) and demand (transactions waiting to be confirmed). Challenges and Actionable Insights The primary challenge highlighted by low Bitcoin transaction fees is the pressure on miner profitability. As the block subsidy continues to decrease over future halvings, the network’s security will rely more heavily on fees to incentivize mining. A prolonged period of extremely low fees in the distant future could theoretically raise questions about long-term security funding, although the network has mechanisms and market dynamics to address this over time (e.g., increased transaction volume, new fee-generating use cases, or simply a higher Bitcoin price making the reduced subsidy still valuable). For those involved: For Users: Enjoy the lower fees! It’s a good time to consolidate UTXOs or make transactions you might have deferred due to high costs. For Miners: Focus on operational efficiency, secure low-cost power sources, and explore hedging strategies. Diversification into hosting services or proprietary trading operations can also help stabilize Bitcoin miner revenue . The market is cyclical, and fee revenue is one of the more volatile components of the mining business. What Could Change the Fee Landscape? Several factors could lead to an increase in BTC fees : Increased Bitcoin Price: A significant rally could attract more users and transaction volume. Resurgence of Fee-Intensive Activity: A new wave of interest in Ordinals, BRC-20s, or other similar protocols could quickly congest the network again. General Market Bull Run: Increased speculative activity across the crypto market often leads to more on-chain movements on all major networks, including Bitcoin. Major Network Events: While the halving primarily impacts the subsidy, it often correlates with increased attention and potential transaction volume. Predicting transaction fees is difficult, as they are a function of organic demand and speculative use cases. However, the current low levels are likely a reflection of the broader market sentiment and reduced speculative fervor compared to previous peaks. Conclusion: A Mixed Bag for the Network The drop in Bitcoin transaction fees to their lowest point since 2022 is a notable development. On one hand, it’s a positive for users, leading to lower crypto transaction costs and making the base layer more accessible for smaller transfers. On the other hand, it presents a challenge for Bitcoin mining operations, significantly reducing their fee-based income and putting pressure on Bitcoin miner revenue . This situation underscores the dynamic and market-driven nature of the Bitcoin network. While low fees benefit users in the short term, the long-term health and security of the network rely on miners remaining profitable enough to continue dedicating computational power. The balance between block subsidy and fees is constantly evolving, and the current low fee environment is a temporary snapshot in Bitcoin’s journey.

Here's All You Need to Know…","The Fed is expected to resume the interest rate cuts it paused in order to ignite a new rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. However, despite the positive economic data, the FED has kept interest rates constant since January due to the uncertainty created by the tariffs. While the Fed is determined to keep interest rates steady until it provides more clarity, US President Donald Trump frequently pressures the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Trump even wants Powell to resign from his position as FED chairman. At this point, Trump called on the FED to cut interest rates even before the June FED decision announced yesterday. However, the FED again ignored Trump and left interest rates unchanged. Trump, who was very angry about this situation, posted on his Truth Scoial account, harshly criticizing Powell for yesterday's decision and calling for her resignation. Donald Trump criticized Jerome Powell on Truth Social, saying: “Too Late. Powell is the worst. And a true idiot who is costing the US billions of dollars.” He also shared an article calling for Powell to resign from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest mortgage lenders. Trump argues that interest rates should be cut now that economic data is good, and has repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Related News: BREAKING! Surprise New Move from Donald Trump! His Company Applied for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF! Here Are the Details... But Powell has ignored them, while Trump claims that Powell's reluctance to cut interest rates is hurting the economy. In response, Powell largely reiterated the central bank's cautious stance on future rate cuts in his remarks yesterday, citing expectations of higher inflation from Trump's trade tariffs as the reason for his decision to leave rates unchanged. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T12:15:42,"Czech government weathers no-confidence vote as $45M BTC donation probe continues","The administration of Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala survived a no-confidence vote initiated over a massive scandal involving a $45 million Bitcoin donation accepted by his ex-minister of justice, who quit to limit the political damage. The opposition, which sought to topple the government a few months ahead of the parliamentary elections this fall, continues to push for more resignations. Fiala’s government gathers enough votes to stay in power The ruling center-right coalition in the Czech Republic rejected an attempt in parliament to bring down the cabinet of Petr Fiala, who has been trying hard to counter the political fallout from a controversial cryptocurrency donation. The scandal already led to the resignation of Justice Minister Pavel Blažek earlier in June, who took responsibility for his department’s decision to accept 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in Bitcoin from a convicted drug dealer. The no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czech parliament, was initiated by the main opposition ANO party. The right-wingers were supported by the far-right SPD and the Pirates but fell short of the 101 votes needed. All parties forming the Fiala government – his conservative ODS, the centrist STAN, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL), and the liberal-conservative TOP 09, largely backed the cabinet, with only a few absences and abstentions, Euractiv noted in a report. Of the 192 members of parliament present during the session on Wednesday, 94 opposition deputies backed the motion while 98 representatives of the ruling majority opposed it, the national radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas broke down the numbers . “We have just had another vote of no-confidence in the government. It went as expected and the government survived the vote,” Petr Fiala commented on X. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala updates that his administration survived a no-confidence vote over a $45 million BTC donation. Source: Petr Fiala Prime Minister’s party damaged by crypto donation scandal Pavel Blažek stepped down in May after reports emerged that the Ministry of Justice took a donation of 480 BTC from Tomáš Jiřikovský, the operator of a darknet market who had been convicted of drug trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal arms possession. Jiřikovský had served four years in prison. Both Blažek and the Czech prime minister admitted that accepting the Bitcoin without proper verification of its source was a “mistake” and “ethically problematic.” Blazek apologized for his role in the case but rejected accusations of corruption. The scandal has impacted Fiala’s Civic Democrats while the other parties in the coalition have been distancing themselves from the affair, which, according to the opposition, undermined public trust in state institutions and stained the country’s reputation abroad. Coalition partner Mayors and Independents (STAN), who criticized the way Petr Fiala handled the matter, eventually backed his administration, after warning about political instability if the government falls before the upcoming elections in October. Earlier, they had demanded that the new Justice Minister Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s ODS party, provide a detailed description of how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the ministry and identify all responsible persons. She promised an independent audit as part of a full investigation. Opposition ANO party insists on finance minister’s resignation The right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Czech Prime Minister and businessman Andrej Babiš, has made it clear it will continue to push for the resignation of Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, despite the government surviving the vote of no-confidence. ANO claims that Stanjura is a key figure in the Bitcoin scandal, as he should have notified the Czech Republic’s Financial Analytical Office and called for a meeting of the National Security Council as soon as he learned about the suspicious crypto donation. Zbyněk Stanjura has already refused to quit his seat. About two weeks ago, he insisted he had not violated the law, maintaining that the Ministry of Justice was solely responsible for the embarrassing affair. While stressing his department was not involved in the decision to accept the cryptocurrency, the finance minister admitted he had been aware of Blažek’s intentions to accept the digital coin donation and even tried to talk him out of it.

Bitcoin’s recent resilience is likely underpinned by growing institutional demand , as corporate balance sheets now show a 135% year-over-year (YoY) increase in BTC holdings, according to CoinMarketCap data. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $104,803, above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $104,296 and with the neutral 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) of 48.18. BTC 24-hour price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap BTC price prediction Taking all the data into account, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT regarding a potential Bitcoin price target for the end of H1, 2025. According to the AI’s calculations, BTC could trade as high as $113,000 by June 30, with a 10% chance of the price dropping below $90,000 by the same time. BTC price prediction. Source: ChatGPT & Finbold In the base case scenario, which the algorithm considers the most likely with 40% probability, Bitcoin will hit a price ranging between $107,000 and $113,000. If institutional demand lessens, however, and the token experiences choppy consolidations, the price might range between $100,000 and $107,000. In a more bearish case, which includes reduced exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows, altcoin drag, and hawkish Federal surprises, the price could drop as low as $90,000. The worst-case scenario, one featuring regulatory crackdowns, a liquidity crisis, or a geopolitical Black Swan event, could see the price drop below $90,000.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency eked out a 0.03% gain in the last 24 hours but still sits 3.5% lower than it did a week ago. According to analyst Captain Faibik, this mix of flat gains and fading strength could mean traders are buying Bitcoin at the top. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Bearish RSI Divergence Signals Weakness Based on data, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted downward after peaking near 80, even as Bitcoin’s price pushed to fresh highs. The RSI now sits at 61.88, a clear sign that buyers are losing steam. Traders often watch for this kind of mismatch—when price goes up but RSI goes down—because it can spell a coming pullback. History shows it doesn’t always lead to a crash, but it does make a correction more likely. After carving out fresh highs, it feels like Bitcoin has hit its ceiling, according to Fabik, and a pullback into the $92,000–$94,000 zone could be on the cards. This setup usually sparks a quick correction, so many traders will be watching closely and tightening up their strategies as the market could shift in a hurry. $BTC is showing a massive RSI Bearish divergence on the weekly chart..!!

An ascending trendline from December 2024 has also been capping gains for weeks. These levels are proving tough to clear. If Bitcoin can’t break through soon, sellers may step in. Faibik points out that hitting these walls and seeing RSI divergence at the same time often marks the high point before a drop. This Activity Points To Caution The derivatives market adds another layer to the story. Trading volume in Bitcoin futures and options rose by 1.60%, taking total activity to around $100 billion. Open interest, meanwhile, slid down 1.30% to nearly $70 billion. This suggests some players are closing their bets rather than piling on new ones. In the past 24 hours, liquidations have wiped out $71 million in long positions. That kind of pain can trigger more sell‑offs if people rush to protect their profits. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Past Patterns Offer Mixed Lessons Looking back, Bitcoin’s rebound in 2022 followed a different playbook. Back then, price hit a low near $16,000 and built strength even as RSI climbed from oversold levels. That setup led to a strong rally. Today, though, the RSI is nowhere near oversold territory. It’s more of a warning flag than a green light. Captain Faibik reminds traders that past wins don’t guarantee future results.

2025-06-19T11:40:37,"Bank of Korea warns that local stablecoins will increase dollar dependence","The Governor of South Korea’s central bank, Rhee Chang-yong, said he is concerned about the country’s early-stage explorations of Korean won-pegged stablecoins, saying they could induce more demand for the U.S. dollar. He noted that this could pose challenges for the central bank in overseeing foreign exchange. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Rhee said issuing won stablecoins may not reduce the use of dollar stablecoins, but rather facilitate the exchange between dollar stablecoins and won stablecoins, which may increase the demand for dollar stablecoins. However, his warning clashed with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung’s agenda to promote won-pegged stablecoins, mainly to prevent capital flight. The ruling Democratic Party proposed earlier this month that the Digital Asset Basic Act, designed to set up regulatory infrastructure, needs to allow local companies to issue won-denominated stablecoins. President Lee appointed Kim Yong-beom, a former crypto firm chief, as his chief policy officer in his first week in office, further boosting speculation that the government would allow issuance of stablecoins backed by the Korean won. Rhee says he is not against the issuance of a won-backed stablecoin Rhee pointed out that he is not opposed to the issuance of a Korean won-pegged stablecoin and, in fact, saw a need for it. However, he added that the impact of such a stablecoin on the monetary system would depend on the form of issuance and the type of assets backing it. Governor Rhee also pointed out that allowing non-banking institutions to issue won-based stablecoins freely could seriously weaken monetary policy. An official from a local commercial lender also said stablecoins are not yet lucrative for banks. But if the won-based stablecoin materialized, banks would, of course, want to play a central role. The proposed stablecoin seeks to reduce reliance on dollar-backed stablecoins, which the Bank of Korea said reached $41.6 billion (56.95 trillion won) on Korea’s five major cryptocurrency exchanges– Upbit , Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone, and Gopax–in Q1 2025, marking a threefold increase from 17.06 trillion won in the third quarter of 2024. An official from the BOK also said the issuance of stablecoins could increase the money supply and potentially affect the status of the won. The official reportedly said it was necessary to approach the matter cautiously, adding that another potential loophole lay in cross-border transactions, possibly threatening the country’s financial stability. South Korea pushes stablecoin bill under new president South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung, is moving fast on campaign pledges as the ruling Democratic Party proposed the Digital Asset Basic Act, which was announced on Tuesday to issue local stablecoins. The bill aims to improve transparency and boost competition within the crypto sector. The move also came as stablecoin trading in South Korea surged, reaching 57 trillion won in Q1 alone. Under the proposed law, South Korean firms could issue stablecoins if they held at least 500 million won in equity capital. These issuers must maintain sufficient reserves and gain approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, Governor Rhee voiced opposition, warning that private stablecoins could undermine the central bank’s control over monetary policy. President Lee’s push for broader crypto integration also included proposals for the national pension fund to invest in Bitcoin and permitting Bitcoin ETFs. Governor Rhee said the central bank would work with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Financial Services Commission to establish appropriate measures as soon as possible. “We would need to consider the broader implications for bank profitability and structural changes if payment and settlement functions — traditionally handled by banks — are expanded to the non-banking sector.” – Rhee Chang-yong , Governor of the Bank of Korea (BoK) The central bank argued that it should lead in regulating a local currency stablecoin. Additionally, establishing a committee to guide crypto policy will ensure the regulatory framework is comprehensive and practical. It will promote the use of digital assets while protecting consumers and ensuring the financial system’s stability.

2025-06-19T11:34:18,"Monster $1.5 billion Solana short squeeze alert","Solana ( SOL ) is trading at $145.50, but under the surface, tension is building across derivatives markets. The latest 30-day Solana Exchange Liquidation Map from Coinglass shows an escalating wave of short-side leverage clustered just above current price, setting the stage for a potential $1.5 billion short squeeze if bulls push the token beyond its immediate resistance zone. At first glance, the setup looks eerily similar to what we’ve seen with Bitcoin and XRP in recent weeks: a rising cumulative short liquidation curve (green), bar clusters thick with high-leverage shorts, and a flatlining long liquidation zone (red), suggesting asymmetrical risk. But Solana’s chart takes it up a notch. A closer look at Solana’s Liquidation Map The liquidation map reveals that short positions start building heavily from around $146, just a dollar above the current price. From there, the green curve steepens dramatically through $150, $155, and all the way to $170, indicating a parabolic rise in short liquidation leverage. Solana Exchange Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass This buildup tells us one thing: traders across Binance , OKX, and especially Bybit have aggressively shorted Solana between $146 and $170, expecting a local top or pullback. But if price begins to climb through that zone, those short positions begin to auto-liquidate, triggering forced buybacks and sending the price higher in a feedback loop. The largest liquidation clusters appear between $150 and $163, with some single levels showing more than $60–75 million in exposure, mostly on Bybit. That suggests retail and aggressive leverage traders have entered positions with tight stops and high risk profiles. Why this setup matters With low spot volume and thinning resistance levels, it doesn’t take much to push SOL into a zone where shorts get flushed out rapidly. If Solana can break and hold above $146–$148, a chain reaction becomes likely. The liquidation map shows no significant resistance zones above that level until the mid-$160s. That gives SOL at least $15–20 of clean air before encountering serious sell pressure, plenty of room for liquidation-fueled price expansion. On the flip side, failure to break above $146 could embolden bears. But with short exposure this elevated, a downside rejection becomes less sustainable because it would mean millions of dollars in still-open shorts remain vulnerable to even minor bullish spikes.

Following the FOMC meeting, broader sentiment in equity markets is mildly negative, with Nasdaq futures down 0.32%. While this isn’t an outright bearish signal, it does keep traders cautious—yet open to directional setups as the session unfolds.</p><p>tradeCompass Summary – June 19, 2025</p><p>Bullish above: $2,557
Bearish below: $2,504.75
Current price: $2,525
Market sentiment: Slightly bearish but undecided</p><p>ETH remains caught between thresholds, so price action near either edge will define the day's bias. Once confirmed, the tradeCompass methodology provides a clear roadmap for execution and partial profit-taking.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bullish Profit Targets</p><p>If Ethereum futures cross and hold above $2,557, the following targets apply:</p><p>$2,567
Quick initial target at the 3rd upper standard deviation of yesterday’s VWAP. Good for immediate risk reduction.</p><p>$2,589
A high-volume node where previous reactions occurred. Expect potential stall or partial unwind.</p><p>$2,604.5
Just below the value area high (VAH) from two days ago. This is a meaningful structural level in Ethereum technical analysis.</p><p>$2,625
Near the VWAP from June 16, often acting as a magnet or inflection point.</p><p>$2,664
Just under the June 16 VAH, where larger players may rotate out or fade moves.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,850
A longer-term swing target if bullish momentum accelerates. This level aligns with broader trend continuation potential.</p><p>ETH Futures – Bearish Profit Targets</p><p>If price breaks below $2,504.75 and confirms momentum:</p><p>$2,499
First quick drop zone, likely to capture trapped longs.</p><p>$2,488.5
Aligned with yesterday’s value area low, this is a standard partial-profit point.</p><p>$2,474.5
Matches prior lows and the second lower deviation of yesterday’s VWAP—expect bounces or reversals here.</p><p>$2,456.7
Just above the third lower VWAP deviation, a high-risk but high-reward target for aggressive shorts.</p><p>Runner Target: $2,315
Backed by volume profile clusters from May 9. A valid swing target if broader risk sentiment deteriorates.</p><p>Extreme Runner: $2,160
This level, ~14.3% below the current price, would require significant breakdown and would only be reached in an extended bearish cycle.</p><p>Understanding tradeCompass: A Professional Technical Framework</p><p>The tradeCompass method integrates:</p><ul><li><p>Volume Profile (VAH, VAL, POC): Highlights areas of price acceptance and rejection</p></li><li><p>VWAP and Standard Deviations: Frames intraday fair value and volatility-based bands</p></li><li><p>Liquidity Zones & Round Numbers: Identifies where market makers and algorithms operate</p></li><li><p>Partial Profit-Taking Strategy: Reduces risk exposure while maximizing opportunity</p></li></ul><p>By defining clear bullish/bearish thresholds and structured exit levels, it reduces overtrading and guides disciplined execution.</p><p>Ethereum Technical Outlook – Use tradeCompass as a Map</p><p>The $2,557 and $2,504.75 levels act as directional decision points. Wait for price confirmation around these lines to engage. Remember, this isn't just a prediction—it's a map for navigating uncertainty. If price fails to break out, patience is a better trade.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>This Ethereum technical analysis offers a decision-support framework, not financial advice.
