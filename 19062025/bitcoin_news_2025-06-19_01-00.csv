2025-06-18T22:24:04,"AI Warns of Crypto Black Swan: Would Blockchains Survive Nuclear War?","ChatGPT’s o3 model was given data and an analytical framework to assess the potential black-swan fallout of a nuclear conflict on the global cryptocurrency ecosystem amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran over nuclear weapons concerns. The model’s core scenarios included both a wide-scale nuclear war and a more localized, tactical nuclear strike, which o3 suggests could immediately disrupt regional exchanges, nodes, and fiat on-ramps wherever the strike occurs. New AI Model Warns of Crypto Chaos in Nuclear Conflict Scenarios In a more severe scenario of widespread nuclear exchange, o3 warns that global internet backbones could be knocked out by electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), forcing transactions to rely on offline relays and satellite fallback systems. These projected disruptions are juxtaposed with real-time market moves observed during the recent Israel-Iran airstrikes . Bitcoin fell sharply late Thursday, sliding over 4% to $103,556 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran that intensified already fragile Middle East tensions. #Bitcoin #Iran https://t.co/ZCEtoEGUuB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 On June 12, for example, explosions in Tehran triggered a sharp reaction in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell by over 4% in 24 hours, from $106,042 to $103,053, before stabilizing near $104,370, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The total crypto market cap shed 3%, with Ethereum and Solana off about 7% and Dogecoin down 6%. Bitcoin crashes 3.3% to $103,556 as Israeli strikes on Iran trigger over $1.16 billion in crypto liquidations, marking the worst day since June with technical analysis pointing to further decline. #Bitcoin #Israel #Iran https://t.co/R6wNFZdHh0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 In the same 24-hour window, a massive crypto liquidation cascade destroyed over $1.16 billion in leveraged positions . It marked one of the most brutal trading days for crypto in recent months. As investors fled to traditional safe havens like gold and oil, crypto and other risk assets sold off aggressively. The scale and speed of the decline validated the AI model’s central thesis: that digital assets remain acutely sensitive to psychological and liquidity shocks during periods of extreme geopolitical risk. From Disruption to Breakdown: How Tactical and Full-Scale Attacks Could Disrupt Blockchain The threat of global war looms over economies as we head into 2025. Experts warn: crypto won’t be spared. #Bitcoin #Regulation #GlobalConflict #DonaldTrump https://t.co/dtQUFJZZFB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 4, 2025 In the case of a limited tactical nuclear strike, o3 noted that, “While regional exchanges, mining facilities, and fiat on-ramps could suffer outages, the global nature of blockchain infrastructure would help preserve core network functionality.” However, the psychological impact alone would likely be enough to trigger a rapid 15-30% decline across major crypto assets, worsened by panic-driven sell-offs and cascading liquidations. Short-term disruptions would be followed by a stabilization period, which depends on the extent of the physical and economic fallout. In contrast, o3 predicts that “a full-scale nuclear exchange, particularly one involving electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), poses a far more existential threat. EMPs have the potential to knock out large swaths of the internet and global power infrastructure.” In such a scenario, blockchain continuity would depend on the availability of satellite relays, off-grid nodes, and fallback communication methods, o3 wrote. While consensus mechanisms may technically survive in isolated zones, transaction delays, ledger fragmentation, and severe network degradation would be likely outcomes. In both scenarios, Bitcoin and other proof-of-work (PoW) networks would face vulnerabilities due to their reliance on high-energy mining infrastructure, often concentrated in specific regions. “Power outages or internet disruptions across key mining hubs could cripple network throughput and hash rate, leaving the system temporarily inoperable until redundancies are activated or grid power is restored,” o3 explained. Nonetheless, the decentralized nature of these PoW systems offers a glimmer of hope: as long as some nodes remain operational, full recovery remains possible. But proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum may hold a structural advantage in such crises. These systems consume less power and have more geographically dispersed validators, improving their chances of maintaining uptime and consensus. However, their dependence on oracles and off-chain data feeds introduces new vulnerabilities. If oracles fail, smart contracts across DeFi platforms could behave unpredictably, resulting in asset freezes, erroneous liquidations, and widespread liquidity failures. Resilience by Design: Why Decentralized Architectures May Outlast Centralized Systems Even more interesting, according to o3, systems built on decentralized architectures with built-in redundancy, such as satellite-linked nodes, solar-powered validators, and mesh relay networks, are more resilient than legacy exchanges or centralized finance platforms. Among the most promising are DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) networks. Unlike traditional blockchains that build a single linear chain of blocks, DAG-based systems allow multiple chains or paths to progress simultaneously. This structure can allow higher throughput and greater flexibility in times of fragmentation or node isolation. Some key DAG and other decentralized networks include: IOTA : Designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), IOTA uses a tangle-based DAG system where transactions validate each other. It eliminates miners entirely in exchange for lightweight, scalable infrastructure. Fantom (Opera) : A DAG-based smart contract platform built to handle high-speed transactions and low fees, often cited for its consensus mechanism (Lachesis) which allows asynchronous validation. Nano : A lightweight, fee-less cryptocurrency using a block-lattice DAG structure, where each account has its own blockchain. Its design supports instant transactions with minimal energy usage. Hedera Hashgraph : Though not a traditional DAG, Hedera uses a gossip-about-gossip protocol that enables high throughput and finality, popular among enterprise blockchain applications. Aleph Zero : A privacy-enhancing DAG chain focused on both performance and zero-knowledge proofs, often referenced in discussions around next-generation Web3 security. Alongside these, more conventional proof-of-stake (PoS) chains like Ethereum 2.0 , Polkadot , and Cosmos also rate highly for their validator diversity and lower energy dependence, key factors if grid stability becomes an issue. Meanwhile, stablecoins would likely face severe redemption pressure as fiat rails collapse and trust in issuer reserves erodes. Memecoins and speculative tokens would also almost certainly collapse. Lacking infrastructure, utility, or robust community organization, these assets are expected to shed nearly all their value in the face of systemic crisis. Conversely, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash could see a sudden surge in demand in a nuclear exchange. These tokens, built for censorship resistance, may serve as essential financial tools for people evading capital controls or seeking anonymity in wartime conditions. Crypto’s Real Test: Rising Inflows Clash with AI Warnings on Network Fragility Despite the turmoil, some signs point to crypto’s resilience, especially in less widespread and dramatic scenarios. Bitcoin ETFs have seen five straight days of inflows, even as the regional Israel-Iran conflict escalated, for example. Over $1.3 billion entered Bitcoin-linked funds in the past week, with $386 million flowing in on June 9 alone, according to Farside Investors . Some industry voices see this as evidence that crypto remains attractive during geopolitical stress, though o3 indicates that, under worst-case scenarios, tech and financial infrastructure would be severely tested. #Bitcoin Geopolitical Events Are Just Noise in the Long-Term Trend If you think new WW3 fears will be the end of crypto, you are mistaken. What do we see on the chart: Every red arrow marks a major war event since 2022. The pattern is crystal clear: Bitcoin doesn't care about… pic.twitter.com/rxv1CUYcmb — Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) June 13, 2025 “Flight to safety” behavior is still present, though the crypto market has been treated largely as a risk asset in the initial stages of the conflict. In a more severe scenario with actual nuclear weapons involved, the outcome is hard to predict. 99% are hedged expecting a war crash This is the perfect recipe for a bullish breakout of the 8-year line Everyone will be positioned for a dump and miss out on the major breakout That’s exactly what they want The perfect storm.. It’s called the 1% for a reason — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 18, 2025 However, there is a widespread narrative that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, may function as a hedge in times of global stress. Despite this, o3 introduces a counterpoint to this bullish narrative. The AI suggests that in the immediate aftermath of such a nuclear disaster, all cryptocurrencies would likely suffer violent selloffs as investors retreat to cash and traditional safe havens. Yet the model does not paint a uniformly bleak picture. As the initial chaos settles, functional differences between digital assets begin to matter. Cryptocurrencies capable of maintaining network integrity, either through decentralized validator sets, satellite node connectivity, or energy-efficient or more decentralized consensus mechanisms, may see relative recovery, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure has been degraded but internet access remains viable. Bitcoin, according to the projection, might demonstrate a degree of price resilience over other assets. Its wider distribution, simpler consensus mechanics, and historical credibility lend it a higher chance of partial survival, even under severe strain. In contrast, highly complex platforms or tokens reliant on off-chain services could falter amid infrastructure breakdowns and data feed disruptions. Regional divergence would become pronounced in such a scenario. In jurisdictions where financial systems collapse but online access endures, operational cryptocurrencies could even begin to substitute as the de facto financial infrastructure. Governments, meanwhile, would likely respond in disparate ways, creating a fragmented regulatory patchwork that influences which cryptocurrencies thrive or decline across different territories. In the long-term reconstruction phase, the AI model anticipates a profound revaluation of the digital gold thesis. Gold, the traditional hedge, would likely outperform all cryptocurrencies during the crisis onset, o3 predicts. But if Bitcoin’s network remains intact in at least part of the world, its utility and symbolism could allow it to rebound faster, perhaps even reinforcing its status as a cornerstone of a new monetary paradigm.

2025-06-18T21:53:53,"Bitcoin (BTC) Fever Spreads: DDC and Others Join the Corporate BTC Craze","Hong Kong-based DDC Enterprise has announced it has entered into three securities purchase agreements that could generate up to $528 million in gross proceeds, excluding placement agent fees and offering expenses. The capital raise features participation from institutional investors, including Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, Kenetic Capital, QCP Capital, and a network of prominent Bitcoin investors. Embracing Bitcoin Treasury Strategy According to the company’s official press release , nearly all proceeds will be used to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The funding includes a $26 million equity PIPE investment through subscription agreements with Animoca Brands, Kenetic Capital, QCP Capital, and notable individuals like Jack Liu and Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin Protocol. DDC said that it expects to issue up to 2,435,169 Class A Ordinary shares at an average price of $10.30 per share, with a 180-day lock-up period. Additionally, DDC has secured a $200 million equity line of credit with Anson, allowing the company flexible access to capital for Bitcoin accumulation, subject to future registration and market conditions. DDC isn’t alone in this approach; Fold Holdings is also pursuing a similar Bitcoin-focused capital strategy. The Arizona-based publicly traded bitcoin financial services company, Fold, has secured a $250 million equity purchase facility, which has granted it the option to issue and sell common stock at its discretion. The company plans to use net proceeds primarily to acquire additional Bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Utilization of the facility will be determined by SEC registration and other conditions. BitMine Immersion Technologies, too, has joined the wave of firms committing capital directly into Bitcoin holdings. The Nevada-based company announced completing Bitcoin purchases using the full $16.34 million in net proceeds from its recent stock offering. The company acquired 154.167 BTC at an average price of $106,033 per coin. CEO Jonathan Bates confirmed the move aligns with BitMine’s commitment to allocate 100% of the raised capital to building its Bitcoin treasury. Eyenovia Embraces HYPE in Treasury Strategy While Bitcoin remains the primary reserve asset for many firms, some are exploring emerging tokens to capture broader crypto exposure. Digital ophthalmic technology company Eyenovia announced a $50 million private placement to launch a cryptocurrency treasury strategy focused on the HYPE token, native to Hyperliquid. The company becomes the first U.S.-listed firm to hold HYPE in its treasury. Hyunsu Jung was appointed Chief Investment Officer and Board Member. If warrants are fully exercised, the transaction could yield up to $150 million.

According to new data from The Block, Binance has captured a commanding 41.1% share of all global spot trading volume in June 2025, and the month is far from over. The volumes include trading of all cryptocurrencies listed on each platform. Binance accounts for 41.1% of all global spot trading volume in June 2025. Source: The Block Binance widens market share gap The monthly spot market volume data across cryptocurrency exchanges shows that Binance has done over $262.37 billion in June so far, further cementing its leadership position among exchanges. Its closest competitor, HTX (formerly known as Huobi), isn’t even close, with over $58.8 billion in volume so far in June. In May 2025, Binance continued its domineering position held all year, doing over $551.2 billion in volume for the month. HTX came fourth, with Bybit and Bitget making up the other top spots in May, with over $107.06 billion in volume. Bybit did over $110.32 billion, and Bitget came in third with over $107.45 billion. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, has processed $33.4 billion in monthly spot market volume in June so far, and the platform did over $84.56 billion in May 2025. A combined 34 other exchanges have done $189.78 billion in June alone, while this same group did $508.87 billion in May 2025. In many ways, this isn’t new. Binance has dominated crypto trading for years, especially after fending off waves of exchange collapses and regulatory clampdowns in 2022 and 2023. The platform hit its highest monthly spot trading volume in May 2021, recording over $1.64 trillion. The closest it has come to those highs was in March 2024, when the exchange did over $1.13 trillion in volume. Binance keeps winning Analysts point to a blend of product, pricing, and scale as the key ingredients behind Binance’s continued dominance. Binance has long championed aggressive promotions, including zero-fee trading for select Bitcoin and stablecoin pairs, drawing high-frequency traders and institutional desk flows alike. Second is liquidity, as the exchange has over 1,900 active spot pairs, Binance offers deep books, tighter spreads, and minimal slippage even during volatile periods. This makes it an attractive venue not just for whales, but also for retail traders looking for efficient execution. Thirdly, Binance continues to invest in global coverage. Fiat on-ramps are available in over 70 jurisdictions. Support is multilingual. And as of 2025, the exchange claims to run multiple regional data centers to optimize latency for traders across continents. Combined, these elements create a kind of network effect that is increasingly hard for smaller exchanges to replicate. Rising competition, but still distant While Binance’s lead has widened, some of its challengers are still gaining ground. HTX has been a constant presence in the scene. Other platforms like ByBit and Bitget saw double-digit spot volume increases in Q1 2025, albeit from smaller bases. Coinbase, despite lagging in global volume, remains dominant in the U.S and North America. and has secured key licenses in Europe. Even so, the volume gap remains massive. Unless there’s a major shakeup, through regulation, security failures, or black swan events, Binance appears likely to retain its throne.

2025-06-18T21:20:38,"Unprecedented: Binance Dominates Spot Trading Volume with One-Year High","BitcoinWorld Unprecedented: Binance Dominates Spot Trading Volume with One-Year High In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency trading, one name consistently stands out: Binance. Recent data highlights a significant milestone for the global exchange giant, demonstrating its continued dominance. If you’re involved in crypto trading, understanding these market dynamics is crucial. What Does Binance’s Spot Trading Volume Tell Us? According to recent analysis based on data from The Block, Binance has achieved a remarkable feat in the realm of spot trading. As of June, Binance’s share of the total crypto market spot trading volume reached an impressive 41.14%. This figure isn’t just a number; it represents the highest market share the exchange has commanded in an entire year, underscoring its significant presence and liquidity in the market. Spot trading, for those new to the term, involves the immediate purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies at their current market price. It’s a core activity for both retail and institutional traders, and the volume on a particular exchange is a strong indicator of its popularity, trust, and depth of order books. Breaking Down the Crypto Market Share While the overall spot trading volume share of 41.14% is notable, a closer look at specific assets reveals even stronger dominance in key cryptocurrencies. The data provides compelling insights: Bitcoin (BTC) Trading Share: Binance’s share of Bitcoin trading volume specifically hit 45.6% in June. This is the highest it has been since July of the previous year, indicating a strong preference among BTC traders for the Binance platform. Ethereum (ETH) Trading Share: For Ethereum, Binance has maintained a Ethereum trading volume share exceeding 50% consistently since March. This sustained majority share highlights Binance’s pivotal role in ETH liquidity and trading activity. This concentration of volume on Binance means that for many traders, it’s the go-to platform for executing large orders with minimal price impact, thanks to deep liquidity pools. It also reflects user trust and potentially competitive fees or features offered by the exchange. Why is High Market Share Important for Binance and Traders? Binance’s substantial crypto market share isn’t just a point of pride for the company; it has tangible implications for the entire ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity: Higher volume attracts more traders, creating deeper liquidity. This makes it easier for users to buy and sell assets quickly at desired prices, reducing slippage, especially for larger trades. Network Effect: As more traders congregate on one platform, it becomes even more attractive to new users, reinforcing its dominant position. Price Discovery: With a significant portion of trading happening on Binance, the prices on its platform often become benchmarks for the broader market. Competitive Advantage: Dominance allows Binance to potentially set industry standards, attract top-tier projects for listings, and invest heavily in technology and security. For traders, this can mean tighter spreads, faster order execution, and access to a wide range of trading pairs. However, it also concentrates risk – any issues or downtime on the leading exchange can have ripple effects across the market. What Factors Contribute to Binance’s Dominance? Several factors likely contribute to Binance’s sustained and growing spot trading volume leadership: Brand Recognition and Trust: Despite regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions, Binance remains a widely recognized and generally trusted name in the crypto space, built over years of operation. Extensive Asset Offering: Binance lists a vast number of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs, catering to a broad spectrum of trader interests. Technology and Infrastructure: The platform is known for its robust trading engine capable of handling massive volumes and its continuous development of features. Ecosystem Integration: The Binance ecosystem, including Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), Binance Labs, and various other services, creates a sticky environment for users. Global Reach: While facing regulatory hurdles in some regions, Binance maintains a significant global user base. These elements combine to create a powerful platform that attracts and retains a large portion of the world’s active crypto traders. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its impressive crypto market share , Binance is not without challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant factor globally, impacting its operations and service offerings in different countries. Competition from other established exchanges and emerging decentralized platforms also continues to evolve. Maintaining this level of dominance requires constant innovation, robust security measures, and navigating complex legal landscapes. The future will see if Binance can continue to grow its spot trading volume or if regulatory pressures and competitive forces will lead to a more fragmented market share distribution. Concluding Thoughts on Binance’s Position Binance’s achievement of its highest spot trading volume share in a year, particularly its strong hold on Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading , is a clear indicator of its current standing as the undisputed leader in the centralized crypto exchange space. This dominance provides significant advantages in terms of liquidity and market influence, shaping the trading experience for millions globally. While challenges persist, the data underscores Binance’s enduring appeal and operational strength in the competitive world of cryptocurrency trading.

2025-06-18T21:05:14,"Russian crypto transactions in foreign trade exceed $12 billion this year","Crypto payments between Russia and its partners in trade this year are approaching 1 trillion rubles in fiat equivalent, revealed a high-ranking official in Moscow. The assessment comes less than a year after President Putin gave the nod to cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency to help Russian companies circumvent Western sanctions. Penalties imposed over his invasion of Ukraine have seriously restricted Russia’s access to global finances and limited its options to make payments through traditional financial channels. Russia counting crypto changing hands in foreign trade The total amount of cryptocurrency transfers between the Russian Federation and other countries since the start of 2025 may reach 1 trillion rubles (over $12.7 billion), according to Anatoly Aksakov, head of the financial markets committee at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament in Moscow. Commenting on the value of Russian crypto transactions with foreign counterparties in an interview with Russia’s official news agency, TASS, Aksakov stated: “I admit, this is already about 1 trillion rubles.” The Russian lawmaker was quick to emphasize, however, that decentralized digital currencies such as Bitcoin should be employed exclusively for international payments. “We firmly stand on the position that cryptocurrencies can only be used for external settlements. We have legalized this option within the framework of the experimental legal regime,” the parliamentarian insisted. Aksakov was referring to Russia’s special legal regime for crypto operations that allows Russian firms to buy and use digital coins to pay trading partners abroad and accept crypto for exports. “Cryptocurrencies are purchased on the domestic market, including at exchange auctions. But at the same time, cryptocurrency should only be used for foreign trade transactions, for example, when delivering goods to Russia,” he elaborated. Anatoly Aksakov was discussing crypto payments on the eve of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum ( SPIEF ), which will be held June 18-21. Its motto this year is “Common Values – the Basis for Growth in a Multipolar World.” The annual event, first launched in 1997, has been held under the auspices of the Russian President for over two decades. It gathers thousands of participants, including heads of state and government and business leaders from more than 100 countries. Moscow not ready to legalize domestic crypto payments Russia is yet to comprehensively regulate cryptocurrencies, but its financial regulators, most notably the Central Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry, have been opposed to legalizing their free circulation in the Russian economy. The concept of creating an experimental legal regime (ELR) to facilitate their limited use in cross-border payments, under strict government oversight, was introduced with a law signed by Vladimir Putin in August 2024. Using anything else than the Russian ruble, which is the only legal tender in the country, as a means of payment outside the ELR would go against the law, which bans “money surrogates.” Earlier in June, a report by the Russian-language edition of Forbes revealed that the federal government plans to punish those who use cryptocurrencies for payments in Russia with seizure and fines . These can reach 1 million rubles for businesses and 200,000 rubles for private citizens. Also, this month, Russia’s monetary authority urged commercial banks to exert tighter control over transactions linked to crypto trading. The call came after the adoption of a law allowing credit institutions to limit monthly transfers and block accounts of persons suspected of fraudulent activities. Russians have tripled their crypto investments over the past three years, according to the Bank of Russia’s own consumer finance survey released in April. However, the regulator wants to limit investor access, allowing only “ highly qualified ” investors to put money into the digital assets. It authorized the offering of crypto derivatives to this category of professionals and rich Russians at the end of May.

2025-06-18T21:00:54,"Bitcoin Corporate Debt: Scaramucci Issues Stark Warning on Risky Trend","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Corporate Debt: Scaramucci Issues Stark Warning on Risky Trend In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where innovation often meets traditional finance, a particular trend has caught the eye of industry veterans: companies leveraging debt to acquire Bitcoin for their balance sheets. While seemingly a savvy financial maneuver to boost potential returns, this strategy isn’t without its critics. One prominent voice raising concerns is Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital. He recently shared his perspective, suggesting that this approach, particularly the use of debt, introduces a significant element of risk that could potentially harm Bitcoin’s standing in the long term. Why Are Companies Buying Bitcoin? Understanding the Trend Over the past few years, we’ve seen a growing number of publicly traded companies allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. The motivations behind this trend are varied, often cited as: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Betting on Bitcoin’s price appreciation to enhance overall company value. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional cash reserves. Embracing Innovation: Signaling forward-thinking and an embrace of digital assets. Initially, much of this acquisition was done using existing cash reserves. However, some entities have explored more aggressive strategies, including taking on debt specifically to fund their Bitcoin purchases. This is where Scaramucci’s warning comes into sharp focus. Scaramucci Bitcoin View: The Danger of Leverage Anthony Scaramucci, a figure with deep roots in both traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto space, hasn’t shied away from expressing his views. His concern isn’t necessarily with companies holding Bitcoin, but specifically with the method of acquisition when it involves significant leverage. He articulated this risk, stating, “This trend, while popular now, could harm Bitcoin once it falls out of fashion.” Think about it: using debt to buy an asset amplifies both potential gains and potential losses. If the asset price goes up, the return on the initial equity is magnified. But if the price falls, the losses are also magnified, and the company still owes the principal plus interest on the borrowed funds, regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. Exploring the Risks of Bitcoin Corporate Debt When companies take on debt to acquire a volatile asset like Bitcoin, they expose themselves to several layers of financial risk: Risk Factor Explanation Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price can experience significant, rapid swings. A sharp downturn could quickly put a leveraged position underwater. Interest Rate Risk If the debt is variable rate, rising interest rates increase the cost of carrying the debt, adding financial pressure. Liquidity Risk & Margin Calls Some leveraged structures might involve margin calls. If Bitcoin’s price drops, the company might be forced to sell assets (potentially the acquired Bitcoin) at a loss to meet these calls, or face liquidation. Balance Sheet Strain High levels of debt, especially for speculative asset purchases, can weaken a company’s balance sheet, impacting its credit rating and ability to borrow for core business operations. Investor Sentiment Shareholders might view a company’s use of debt for crypto as overly risky, potentially impacting stock price negatively, independent of Bitcoin’s performance. This potential for forced selling during a market downturn is a key part of Scaramucci’s concern. If multiple leveraged companies face similar pressures simultaneously, it could theoretically exacerbate a market decline, creating a negative feedback loop that could indeed “harm Bitcoin” in the sense of driving its price down sharply and potentially damaging its reputation as a stable corporate treasury asset. Is This a Sustainable Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? The sustainability of using debt for Bitcoin acquisition is debatable. For companies with robust cash flow and a high tolerance for risk, it might seem appealing during bull markets. However, during bear markets or periods of economic uncertainty, this strategy becomes significantly more precarious. Scaramucci’s point about the trend potentially falling “out of fashion” highlights the speculative nature of this particular approach compared to simply holding Bitcoin purchased with organic profits or existing cash. A more conservative corporate Bitcoin strategy typically involves allocating a small percentage of existing, non-essential cash reserves. This limits the downside risk to the amount of cash deployed, without the added burden and potential liquidation pressure of debt. Bitcoin Investment Risk: Beyond Corporate Balance Sheets While Scaramucci’s comments focus on the corporate level, the concept of using leverage to invest in Bitcoin is a broader point of Bitcoin investment risk. Individual investors using margin on exchanges face similar, if not greater, risks of liquidation during volatile periods. The principle remains consistent: leverage magnifies outcomes in both directions. For companies, the stakes are arguably higher, as their financial decisions impact employees, shareholders, and their overall business health. A misstep in treasury management due to excessive risk-taking in asset acquisition could have severe consequences far beyond the investment itself. Actionable Insights for the Concerned Observer What does this mean for investors or those watching the space? Scaramucci’s warning serves as a reminder to look beyond just the fact that a company holds Bitcoin. It’s crucial to understand how they acquired it. When evaluating companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet: Examine their financial statements: Look at debt levels and how the Bitcoin purchase was funded. Assess their core business health: Is the company fundamentally strong, or is the Bitcoin play a potentially risky attempt to boost performance? Consider market conditions: How might rising interest rates or a market downturn impact their leveraged position? Understanding these factors provides a more complete picture of the company’s financial health and the true risk associated with their Bitcoin holdings. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning Anthony Scaramucci’s critique of companies using debt to buy Bitcoin is a pertinent reminder that not all Bitcoin acquisition strategies are created equal. While adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer potential benefits, employing significant leverage introduces substantial risks related to market volatility, interest rates, and potential forced selling. As the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption continues, it’s vital to differentiate between strategies based on solid cash reserves and those relying on potentially precarious debt financing. Scaramucci’s warning serves as a valuable caution in a market often characterized by exuberance: understanding the underlying financial structure is key to assessing the true risk.

2025-06-18T21:00:52,"$8 XRP Breakout Brewing — SEC No Longer A Roadblock, Bullish Analyst Says","Interest is building among XRP investors after Crypto Beast, a well‑known analyst, put forward a bold forecast. He sees a minimum breakout level of $8 on the horizon. With the US Securities and Exchange Commission no longer posing a roadblock, Crypto Beast believes XRP has a clear path ahead. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence His view rests on the idea that the market still hasn’t fully priced in XRP’s cleared status with regulators. Short‑term traders and long‑term holders alike are tuning in. Regulatory Milestone And Market Reaction According to court records, XRP won a key victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that it’s not a security under US law. That moment sent XRP from about $0.48 to $0.93 very fast. But prices slipped back over the next few weeks, bringing it down to the $0.50 area again. Then, after US President Donald Trump won re‑election and signaled a shake‑up at the SEC, XRP marched into a new range around $2.00. Despite that climb, Crypto Beast argues the legal win hasn’t been fully valued by the wider market. XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security.$XRP holders are about to PRINT. I’ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You’ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 Technical Pattern Points To Upside Crypto Beast pointed to a bull flag chart pattern that starts with a rally from $0.40 up to $3.40. A flag pattern formed when XRP pulled back into the $2.00–$3.00 zone. He marked the breakout level at $3.37. By measuring the height of that $3.00 pole and adding it to the low of the flag, he arrived at a target near $10.69. In another post, he set a more conservative floor of $8.80, a roughly 4x gain from today’s price around $2.20. That kind of move would push XRP’s market cap above $500 billion, putting it in league with big firms like Oracle, Netflix and Mastercard. Broader Crypto Trends And Correlation Based on reports from his channel, Crypto Beast isn’t just upbeat on XRP price about to “explode”. He’s looking for a 3x rise in Solana, a 2x pop in Ethereum and a 5x run in SUI. Even more, he’s penciled in potential 40x gains for select smaller tokens. Still, these forecasts rest on a growing crypto mood—mostly led by Bitcoin. When BTC stalls or dips, large altcoins often follow suit. So any rally in XRP may need fresh money flowing into the whole market.

He reminded followers that patterns do fail and charts alone can’t guarantee gains. A sudden market shift or a change in macro sentiment could spoil the setup. He advises setting stop‑loss levels and watching BTC for hints. His trust in XRP’s future is strong, but he wants traders to be ready for any twist.

2025-06-18T21:00:51,"Expert Says Patience Is Key As XRP Hovers Around $2 Ahead Of The Ripple-SEC In August","XRP is currently holding steady around the $2 level , but crypto analysts suggest that traders hoping for a quick breakout may need to wait a little longer. During this time, market expert Egrag Crypto emphasizes the importance of patience as all eyes turn to the upcoming Ripple-SEC legal update in August. With this long-running court battle still hanging over XRP, the outcome of the legal case could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s next big move. XRP Tests Key Resistance Before Next Big Push CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP is consolidating just below the critical $2 psychological level after a volatile price rejection , which Egrag Crypto described as a “nasty candle” on the 12-hour chart. Over the past few weeks, the token has been gradually building momentum , inching closer toward a breakout above a long-term descending trendline that could signal a return of its previous bullish trend . The chart shows that the price had attempted to escape this persistent downtrend marked by a yellow resistance line within a wedge pattern. However, the move faced immediate resistance near $2.23, where the cryptocurrency’s price was swiftly pushed back, forming a large upper wick that confirmed heavy selling pressure or profit-taking activity at higher levels. Despite this rejection, Egrag Crypto stressed the need for patience during this crucial market phase, especially with the legal battles between Ripple and the SEC still ongoing. While XRP continues to hover around the $2 support zone, the overall chart still shows a bullish setup forming . Potential targets are clearly mapped at $2.2 and $2.32 if the altcoin can reclaim and sustain levels above the descending trendline . A downside retest is also possible near the $1.90 region, which has been marked as a key accumulation zone . Ripple-SEC Delay Puts XRP Breakout On Ice Based on Egrag Crypto’s analysis, the sudden rejection of XRP’s price occurred in tandem with new developments in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC. A joint filing submitted to the Second Circuit Court by Ripple and the regulator requested a pause in the appeal process, pending a decision from the district court on a motion for an indicative ruling. Notably, this decision has now been delayed until August 2025. This delay adds a layer of uncertainty that could influence short-term market sentiment . Egrag Crypto highlights that just as XRP was attempting a breakout, legal headlines shifted the narrative, possibly prompting traders to step back. The analyst noted that this pause in an overdue court battle could give institutional players more time to prepare and potentially step in around the $2 level. With August now set as a critical point in the ongoing legal battle, XRP’s breakout potential may remain on ice for now. Until a ruling is issued, the cryptocurrency’s price action is likely to stay in a holding pattern, with the market caught in between waiting for technical breakout confirmations and clarity from the courtroom about a resolution in the Ripple-SEC case .",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-hovers-around-2/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Accumulation Zone|Coinmarketcap|Descending Trendline|Egrag Crypto|ripple|ripple news|Second Circuit Court|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

According to the announcement, Coinbase and Nodal Clear aim to finish the integration by 2026. Coinbase Aims to Expand USDC Presence in its Ecosystem Intriguing, this move strengthens the role of stablecoins in regulated financial markets. It also marks an essential step toward updating the derivatives infrastructure with blockchain-based assets. Furthermore, this partnership aims to integrate USDC more deeply into the Coinbase platform. It will provide traders a more flexible, transparent, and efficient way to meet margin requirements for crypto futures contracts. Nodal Clear will ensure that risk management practices meet current regulations while allowing USDC to be used as collateral alongside traditional assets. The decision to accept USDC as futures collateral signifies growing interest in using digital solutions within conventional financial systems. Coinbase Aims to Make Futures Market More Accessible In March, Coinbase announced its plans to launch 24/7 futures trading for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the United States. The exchange plans to offer futures contracts in different sizes, catering to institutional investors and retail traders. Smaller investors can participate in the market by including nano-sized contracts without needing large amounts of capital. This move could also attract more people to crypto futures trading, making the market more inclusive. With this launch, Coinbase Derivatives gives U.S. traders more freedom and flexibility. Likewise, they can now respond to market changes and utilize opportunities. Coinbase Bets Big on Derivatives Expansion Recall that Coinbase’s biggest headline came from the announcement of its acquisition of Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives exchange, in May. The $2.9 billion deal is the largest in the crypto industry and signals Coinbase’s ambitions to deepen its presence in the high-volume derivatives sector. Deribit reported $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and currently boasts $30 billion in open interest, which Coinbase will now inherit as part of its expanding empire.

2025-06-18T20:50:03,"US-Iran Tensions: Urgent Geopolitical Risk Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability","BitcoinWorld US-Iran Tensions: Urgent Geopolitical Risk Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability In the world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about global events is crucial. While our focus is often on blockchain developments, regulatory news, or market trends, major geopolitical shifts can significantly impact the entire financial landscape, including the Cryptocurrency Market . Recent reports regarding potential escalations in US-Iran Tensions serve as a stark reminder of this interconnectedness. How Do US-Iran Tensions Create Geopolitical Risk for Global Markets? News surfaced recently, according to Odaily, that U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged the possibility of issuing an ultimatum to Iran, though specifics remain undisclosed. Simultaneously, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated the Pentagon’s readiness to act based on any decision made by President Trump concerning the situation. This development immediately registers as heightened Geopolitical Risk . Here’s why: Uncertainty: The lack of detail surrounding a potential ultimatum creates significant uncertainty about future actions and potential consequences. Potential for Escalation: Any direct ultimatum could escalate diplomatic tensions, potentially leading to military confrontation or increased proxy conflicts in the region. Impact on Key Resources: The Middle East is vital for global energy supplies. Conflict or instability there can directly impact oil prices and global economic stability. Such risks don’t remain isolated; they ripple through traditional financial markets, affecting stocks, bonds, and commodities. Understanding the Impact of Geopolitical Risk on the Cryptocurrency Market The Cryptocurrency Market , while often seen as distinct from traditional finance, is not immune to macro global forces. Geopolitical Risk can influence crypto through several channels: Investor Sentiment: Fear and uncertainty in the broader global economy often lead investors to re-evaluate their portfolios. Some may flee riskier assets, while others may seek alternative stores of value. Capital Flows: Major global events can trigger significant capital movements as investors look for safer havens or opportunities arising from instability. Macroeconomic Effects: If geopolitical tensions impact global trade, energy prices, or lead to economic downturns, this affects the overall liquidity and risk appetite available for assets like cryptocurrencies. The narrative around crypto’s role during times of crisis is complex. Some view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ – a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value that could perform well when traditional systems are threatened. Others see it as a risk-on asset, susceptible to sell-offs during broad market panic. Will Bitcoin Price React to Rising Tensions? Given its position as the largest cryptocurrency, the potential impact on Bitcoin Price is a key concern for many investors. Historically, Bitcoin’s reaction to geopolitical events has been mixed and often depends on the specific nature of the crisis and the prevailing market sentiment at the time. Rising US-Iran Tensions could potentially influence Bitcoin Price in opposing ways: Upward Pressure (Safe Haven Narrative): If investors perceive the tensions as a threat to traditional financial stability or fiat currencies, they might move into Bitcoin as a hedge, potentially driving the price up. Downward Pressure (Risk-Off Sentiment): If the tensions trigger a broad market sell-off across all asset classes due to panic or margin calls, Bitcoin could be sold alongside stocks and other assets, leading to a price decline. It’s important to note that correlations between geopolitical events and Bitcoin Price are not always straightforward or predictable. The unique characteristics of the crypto market mean it can react differently than traditional assets. Navigating Potential Market Volatility in the Crypto Space One of the most likely outcomes of increased Geopolitical Risk is increased Market Volatility . The cryptocurrency market is already known for its significant price swings, and external shocks can amplify this. Understanding and preparing for potential Market Volatility is essential for anyone involved in the Cryptocurrency Market . This involves: Staying Informed: Keep track of major global news events, not just crypto-specific ones. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider strategies like diversification or setting stop-loss orders. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price swings driven by news events. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Understanding Your Assets: Know whether the cryptocurrencies you hold are typically seen as risk-on or potential safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty. The potential for heightened US-Iran Tensions adds another layer of complexity to the already dynamic Cryptocurrency Market . While the direct outcome of President Trump’s potential actions remains unclear, the increased Geopolitical Risk is a factor that cannot be ignored by investors. Conclusion: Geopolitical Ripples in the Digital Ocean The reports of potential ultimatums and military readiness regarding US-Iran Tensions highlight how events far removed from the immediate crypto world can cast a shadow over it. This significant Geopolitical Risk has the potential to influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, contribute to increased Market Volatility , impacting assets like Bitcoin Price . While predicting the exact reaction of the Cryptocurrency Market is impossible, acknowledging the potential for external shocks is vital for responsible participation. Staying informed and employing sound risk management practices are your best tools for navigating these uncertain waters.

2025-06-18T20:40:12,"Urgent Trump Iran Warning: Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Urgent Trump Iran Warning: Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Volatility In the ever-watchful world of global finance and cryptocurrency, geopolitical developments frequently send ripples across markets. A recent statement attributed to former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Iran has captured attention, highlighting potential escalating tensions and raising questions about their impact on investor strategies and market stability. What Did Trump Say About Trump Iran Relations? According to reports, including one from JinSe Finance, Donald Trump made striking claims about Iran’s attempts to initiate talks with the U.S. Trump reportedly stated that Iran contacted the United States “too late” for negotiations. He went further, asserting that Iran currently possesses no effective defense capabilities. The former president called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” and issued a stark warning that the upcoming week could prove even more critical than the current period. This kind of strong rhetoric from a prominent global figure, especially one with a history of direct engagement and disengagement with international adversaries, immediately flags a potential increase in geopolitical risk . While the immediate context is political and military, the implications for global financial systems, including the burgeoning crypto market , are significant. Why Does Geopolitical Risk Matter for the Crypto Market? Cryptocurrencies, often touted as uncorrelated assets, are not immune to macro global events. Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical tension have led to various reactions in the crypto space: Flight to Safety? Some argue that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as a safe haven asset during times of political or economic instability, similar to gold. Investors in regions facing currency devaluation or capital controls might turn to crypto. Increased Volatility: Conversely, global uncertainty can trigger risk-off sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Investors might sell volatile assets to hold cash or traditional safe havens. This can lead to significant price swings and increased market volatility . Impact on Investor Sentiment: News of potential conflict or major international disputes directly influences investor sentiment . Fear and uncertainty can lead to panic selling, while perceived threats to traditional systems might push some towards decentralized alternatives. Regulatory Responses: Geopolitical events can also accelerate or alter regulatory discussions around cryptocurrencies, especially concerning their use in bypassing sanctions or for illicit finance. Trump’s specific warning about a “critical week ahead” amplifies this concern. Such statements create anticipation and uncertainty, which are often catalysts for market movements, both up and down. How Could Trump’s Warning Influence Investor Sentiment and Market Volatility? A warning of a “critical week” from a former U.S. President regarding a country like Iran can significantly impact market psychology. Investors become more cautious, potentially reducing exposure to riskier assets. This cautious approach can manifest in several ways: Potential Market Reactions: Short-Term Uncertainty: The immediate effect is often increased uncertainty, leading to choppy trading conditions. Correlation Shifts: The correlation between crypto and traditional assets (like stocks) might change depending on the nature of the geopolitical event that unfolds. Liquidity Crunch: In extreme scenarios, widespread panic could lead to a rush for liquidity, impacting even highly liquid markets like major cryptocurrencies. For the crypto market , this means monitoring global news closely becomes even more crucial. While the direct link between Trump’s statement and Bitcoin’s price might not be immediately obvious, the statement contributes to the overall global risk picture that traders and investors evaluate constantly. Navigating Geopolitical Risk Crypto Connections: What Should Investors Consider? Given the potential for increased market volatility stemming from rising geopolitical risk , particularly in light of strong statements like those concerning Trump Iran relations, crypto investors might consider several strategies: Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to major global political and economic developments. Review Risk Exposure: Assess your portfolio’s exposure to volatility. Consider if your current allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in a potentially uncertain environment. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified, not just within crypto but across different asset classes if appropriate for your financial goals. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Consider Stablecoins: For those looking to reduce exposure during volatile periods without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely, stablecoins offer a potential temporary refuge. The call for “unconditional surrender” and the warning of a “critical week” are strong signals that could precede significant developments. While the precise nature of these developments remains unknown, prudent investors should factor the possibility of heightened geopolitical risk into their decision-making process. Historical Context: Geopolitics and Market Reactions History provides numerous examples of how geopolitical events have impacted financial markets. While the crypto market is relatively young compared to traditional markets, it has already shown sensitivity to global events: Major conflicts or threats of conflict often lead to initial market sell-offs as uncertainty peaks. Sanctions and trade disputes can disrupt global supply chains and economic forecasts, influencing asset prices. Political instability in key regions can impact currency values and capital flows, indirectly affecting crypto. The dynamic between Trump Iran discussions, or lack thereof, and global stability is a classic example of a geopolitical flashpoint that markets monitor closely. The fact that a former President’s comments are still newsworthy underscores the potential long-term impact of such tensions. Conclusion: Monitoring the Horizon Donald Trump’s recent statements regarding Iran serve as a potent reminder that global politics and geopolitical risk remain critical factors influencing financial markets, including the increasingly interconnected crypto market . His assertion that Iran reached out too late and the stark warning of a “critical week ahead” injects a degree of uncertainty into the global outlook. For crypto investors, this is not a direct trading signal but a prompt to be aware of the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. Increased tension can lead to heightened market volatility and shifts in investor sentiment . Staying informed, understanding the potential implications of geopolitical events like those involving Trump Iran dynamics, and maintaining a disciplined investment approach are key to navigating potentially turbulent times. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be watching closely to see if the warned “critical week” brings significant developments and how global markets, including crypto, react.

2025-06-18T20:31:32,"Onyxcoin price plummets 11%: what triggered the decline?","The token fell from $0.01421 to $0.01319 during Wednesday’s Asian evening session. The 10.98% plunge came without any clear news catalyst, suggesting a reaction to broader crypto market weakness and a technical retest of key support. According to CoinMarketCap data, Onyxcoin ( XCN ) saw a volatile 10.98% correction during Wednesday’s Asian trading session, plummeting from its daily high of $0.01421 to a swing low of $0.01319 within hours. As of press time, Onyxcoin had recovered slightly to trade at $0.01339, with the partial rebound coinciding with Bitcoin’s bounce above $104,000. XCN now faces immediate resistance at the $0.01380 breakdown point, while sustained buying pressure could see a retest of the $0.014 psychological level. You might also like: Coinbase taps Circle’s USDC for its new stablecoin payment solution Why XCN price plunged Several key factors help explain Wednesday’s tumble. Over the past week, XCN’s 24-hour trading volume has fluctuated between $24 million and $27 million, relatively modest compared to mid-cap peers, but still liquid enough for small order imbalances to cause sharp swings. That backdrop means even modest order imbalances, whether profit‑taking by insiders or stops activated by bots, can trigger outsized moves. Despite the absence of any negative news, the broader altcoin sector has been under pressure as Bitcoin’s recent indecision and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment. In XCN’s case, the $0.01330–$0.01340 range acted as a short-term support zone. The token stabilized around $0.01339 in early U.S. hours as buyers stepped in to absorb recent liquidations. Beyond market structure and sentiment, Onyxcoin’s fundamentals may also be contributing to fragility. The project’s ambitious shift toward Layer-3 infrastructure is now facing its first serious stress test, as the token struggles to hold critical support levels. With less than two weeks remaining before crucial DAO votes conclude, traders are closely watching for updates. Draft proposals reviewed by crypto.news suggest a potential doubling of staking rewards—a move that could either provide short-term price support or trigger another wave of profit-taking. For now, Onyxcoin remains caught between its long-term technical promise and the market’s short-term realities, a precarious position that’s become increasingly common for altcoins navigating 2025’s unpredictable crypto landscape.

2025-06-18T20:26:07,"Chinese Bitcoin Hardware Titans Control 95% of Market, Now Coming to America to Dodge Trump Tariff War","Three of China’s largest Bitcoin hardware manufacturers are establishing production facilities in the United States as President Donald Trump’s tariff policies reshape the cryptocurrency industry. The three industry leaders, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, collectively control over 90% of the global mining rig market. These companies are the architects of Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure, manufacturing the specialized ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) machines that form the backbone of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency network. Every Bitcoin mined globally likely passes through hardware bearing Chinese engineering fingerprints. 95% Market Control Sparks “Digital Dependency Trap” and Security Risks According to a June 18 Reuters report, these Bitcoin mining giants are establishing U.S. operations to circumvent potential tariffs. However, critics have raised security concerns about Chinese involvement in sectors spanning semiconductor manufacturing and energy infrastructure. Guang Yang, chief technology officer at crypto technology provider Conflux Network, described the situation as extending beyond trade policy. “The U.S.-China trade war goes beyond tariffs,” Yang stated. “It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” Bitmain, the largest of the three companies by revenue, initiated U.S. production of mining equipment in December , one month after Trump’s presidential election victory. Canaan began trial production in the United States on April 2 to avoid tariffs following Trump’s announcement of new trade levies.

When measured by computing power sold, these three Chinese companies command 95.4% of the global market share. The Bitcoin ecosystem encompasses five primary segments: hardware supply, mining farm operations, mining pool management, trading platforms, and payment processing services. Hardware manufacturers like Canaan, the first Bitcoin mining company to go public and the second-largest by computing power , focus exclusively on integrated circuit (IC) design, manufacturing, and equipment sales. Industry analysts project continued sector expansion, with the market expected to reach $11.9 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate of 15.3%, contingent on Bitcoin’s continued price appreciation driven by supply scarcity. Source: Frost & Sullivan China’s Historical Bitcoin Mining Advantage Understanding today’s migration requires examining how China achieved such overwhelming market control in the first place. The foundation was laid during the historic 2017 Bitcoin boom, when three key factors aligned to create Chinese mining supremacy. During the early expansion phase, Chinese officials recognized cryptocurrency mining as a profitable venture that attracted substantial foreign investment. Consequently, authorities initially overlooked the mining sector while simultaneously restricting Bitcoin trading and initial coin offerings.

While the United States leads global Bitcoin mining operations with over 38% of total network activity , American miners depend almost entirely on Chinese-manufactured equipment. America Leads Bitcoin Mining Operation/ Source: Bitbo This creates what security analysts describe as a “digital dependency trap,” a scenario where America’s cryptocurrency infrastructure relies fundamentally on hardware produced by its primary economic rival. Guang Yang, Conflux Network’s chief technology officer, frames this dependency in geopolitical terms that extend far beyond trade economics . “The U.S.-China trade war goes beyond tariffs,” Yang explains. “It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” His assessment reflects growing concerns within the cryptocurrency community about supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact national economic security.

2025-06-18T20:21:42,"Crypto Lenders Hold Nearly $60B of Assets as New Wave of DeFi Adoption Sweeps In: Report","There's a quiet transformation underway in decentralized finance (DeFi). While DeFi's previous bull market was driven by eye-watering—and dubious—yields and speculative frenzy, the current growth has been powered by the sector becoming a backend financial layer for user-facing apps and increasing institutional participation, according to a Wednesday report by analytics firm Artemis and on-chain yield platform Vaults.fyi. The total value locked (TVL) on top DeFi lending protocols—including Aave, Euler, Spark and Morpho—has surged past $50 billion and approaching $60 billion, growing 60% over the past year, the report showed. This growth has been driven by rapid institutionalization and increasingly sophisticated risk management tools. ""These are not merely yield platforms; they are evolving into modular financial networks undergoing rapid institutionalization,"" the authors said. The 'DeFi mullet' One of the key trend recently the report highlighted is user-facing applications quietly embedding DeFi infrastructure in the backend to offer yield or loans. These features are abstracted away from users creating a more seamless experience, a trend often called the ""DeFi mullet:"" fintech front-end, DeFi backend, the report said. Coinbase users, for instance, can borrow against their bitcoin BTC holdings powered by DeFi lender Morpho’s backend infrastructure. More than $300 million in loans have already originated via this integration as of this month, the report pointed out. Bitget Wallet’s integration with lending protocol Aave offers a 5% yield on USDC and USDT holdings across chains without leaving the crypto wallet app. PayPal is also doing something similar with its PYUSD stablecoin, offering yields near 3.7% to PayPal and Venmo wallet users, albeit without the DeFi element. The report said crypto-friendly fintech firms with large user bases, such as Robinhood or Revolut, may also adopt this strategy and offer services like stablecoin credit lines and asset-backed loans through DeFi markets, creating new fee-based revenue streams. Tokenized RWAs in DeFi Increasingly, DeFi protocols are introducing use cases for tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as U.S. Treasuries and credit funds, also known as real-world assets (RWA). These tokenized assets can serve as collateral, earn yield directly or be bundled into more complex strategies. Read more: Tokenized Apollo Credit Fund Makes DeFi Debut With Levered-Yield Strategy by Securitize, Gauntlet Tokenization of investment strategies is also becoming popular. Pendle, a protocol that lets users split yield streams from principal, now manages over $4 billion in total value locked, much of it in tokenized stablecoin yield products. Meanwhile, Ethena’s sUSDe and similar yield-bearing tokens have introduced products that deliver returns above 8% through strategies like cash-and-carry trades, all while abstracting away the operational burden for the end user. Rise of on-chain asset managers A less visible but critical trend highlighted in the report is the rise of crypto-native asset managers. Firms like Gauntlet, Re7 and Steakhouse Financial allocate capital across DeFi ecosystems using professionally managed strategies, resembling the role of traditional asset managers. These players are deeply embedded in DeFi protocol governance, fine-tune risk parameters and deploy capital across a range of structured yield products, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and modular lending markets. The report noted that the sector’s capital under management has grown fourfold since January—from $1 billion to over $4 billion.

2025-06-18T20:00:54,"Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger","The Ethereum price action is showing remarkable similarities to its 2017 market cycle, with analysts pointing to a near-identical technical setup and market behaviour. Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader, who shared a side-by-side weekly chart comparison of 2025 and 2017 on X (formerly Twitter), suggests that Ethereum is now following the same breakout pattern that once led to a historic rally. This time, however, the analyst believes that the move could be even more significant. Ethereum Price Mirrors Historic Breakout Pattern In the current 2025 chart, Ethereum has reportedly claimed the 50-week Moving Average (MA) after months of downward pressure and range-bound movement. Following a decisive breakout from support levels near $2,250, the price of the cryptocurrency is now consolidating below the 50 MA, forming a tight sideways pattern. Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to Merlijn the Trader, this structure is visually and technically similar to price movements that occurred in late 2016 and early 2017, just before Ethereum began a powerful upward surge. The analyst’s 2017 Ethereum chart shows the altcoin breaking above the 50 MA, followed by a brief period of sideways action under resistance. Once momentum was built, the price launched into a parabolic rally that marked the beginning of its major bull cycle. Notably, the 2025 chart situated on the right panel displays an almost identical playbook to the 2017 setup, with Ethereum moving out of a prolonged accumulation phase and into a zone of consolidation beneath key resistance levels. However, this time, market conditions are significantly different. The analyst notes that the crypto space is far more developed, with increased institutional involvement, broader retail adoption, and growing infrastructure supporting Ethereum’s ecosystem. While the technical patterns align closely with the 2017 breakout, the scale and context suggest that the potential upside could even be greater. The similarities between Ethereum’s 2017 and 2025 price action lie in the timing of the 50 MA reclaim and the tight range of consolidation that follows. If ETH can maintain this trajectory and break above the current resistance zone, it could mark the beginning of a fresh macro rally, which the analyst predicts will not just repeat history but possibly amplify it. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 As 2017 Pattern Repeats Based on Merlijn The Trader’s comparable chart analysis, Ethereum may be on the verge of a major breakout, with technical patterns pointing to a potential price target above $4,000. In the 2017 setup, Ethereum skyrocketed past $28 from a low between $6 and $7.5 after reclaiming the 50 MA. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target If history is any guide, Ethereum’s next move could propel it from its current price of $2,541 to $4,000, which aligns with the upper red horizontal line on the 2025 price chart or above the line to fresh all-time highs, with no ceiling in sight, according to the analyst.

2025-06-18T20:00:39,"Investors ‘Massively Underestimating’ Growth Potential of This US Sector, According Wedbush’s Dan Ives","Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes that one stock market segment will continue to surprise investors with its upside in the next five years. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that stocks in the US tech sector will continue to print gains and trade above their fair value in the coming years. According to Ives, the tech sector will witness massive developments in the years ahead, fueled by the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). “My view of tech, if you focus just on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years. I believe the market is still massively underestimating what growth is going to look like for the AI revolution in tech… You could say some of these are expensive. You’ve got the next two, three, four, five years, given our view of autonomous robotics, that’s why I think we’re going to be talking about the Nasdaq 20,000, 25,000, over the coming years. And that’s why any type of geopolitical sort of events, we always view as opportunities to own these names cheaper. That’s always been our view in the last 25 years covering tech.” As of Tuesday’s close, the Nasdaq is trading at 21,719 points.

2025-06-18T20:00:00,"5 Cryptocurrencies to Accumulate This Summer Before the Market Turns Bullish","Summer 2025 presents accumulation opportunities as crypto markets prepare for the next bullish cycle. Smart investors position themselves in projects with strong fundamentals before adoption drives prices higher. MAGACOIN FINANCE leads this selection with its fixed 170 billion token supply and active presale offering 100% bonus tokens. Apart from MAGACOIN, these four cryptocurrencies offer distinct advantages for summer accumulation strategies before market sentiment shifts bullish. Why MAGACOIN Could Turn Bullish This Summer MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as the strongest accumulation target with mathematical advantages that established cryptocurrencies cannot deliver. The project’s fixed 170 billion token supply creates predictable scarcity while current presale pricing offers exponential upside potential. Current presale participants receive 100% bonus tokens before staking launches, effectively doubling positions at entry. Crypto analysts are forecasting a breakout as institutional capital rotates from underperforming altcoins into high-growth opportunities. The HashEx audit provides security assurance while community ownership removes venture capital interference that suppresses token performance in competing projects. Smart money recognizes this asymmetric risk-reward profile where downside remains limited while upside reaches exponential levels. Active staking creates supply shortage conditions as early participants lock tokens for extended periods. On-chain metrics show decreasing sell pressure after initial purchases, indicating strategic accumulation rather than speculative trading. XRP Investors Should Brace For a Pump? Canada launched the first spot XRP ETF today via Purpose Investments Inc., listed on Toronto Stock Exchange with symbol XRP. This represents institutional access to XRP without direct token holding. The Ripple vs. SEC case continues to reflect positive signs as the two sides agreed to postpone appeals until August 15, 2025. They are waiting for Judge Analisa Torres to rule on their mutual motion to vacate the injunction and lower penalties to $50 million. If the settlement is approved, it could mark the end of the long case and potentially pave the way for U.S. XRP ETF approval. Despite recent price weakness with XRP down 6% over the past seven days, institutional activity offers accumulation opportunities. Legal clarity combined with ETF availability offers bullish factors that position XRP for appreciation in summer. Why KAS Should Be on Your Radar Kaspa’s Crescendo upgrade went live on mainnet, accelerating network performance with improved rates of block production from 1 to up to 10 blocks per second. The hardfork occurred on May 5, 2025, and developers guarantee smooth performance at the new speed. The tech upgrade puts KAS on the way towards increased transaction throughput and improved user experience. Even when it was at $0.072 with a 19% weekly drop, analysts cite a 21% three-month rebound as an indicator of mid-term strength. Year-on-year performance is 54% lower, but the recent upgrade provides fresh underpinnings to utility. The network is now ten times quicker to complete transactions, overcoming scalability problems that held back adoption. Smart money accumulates during technical upgrade phases when utility improvements haven’t been reflected in price yet. The Crescendo upgrade provides fundamental value that supports long-term appreciation as adoption grows. SUI’s DeFi Utility Surges SUI trades between $2.8-$3.15 after retracing from its $5 peak earlier this year, creating accumulation opportunities at discounted levels. The network’s total value locked surged to $1.742 billion according to DeFiLlama, while stablecoin supply approaches $1.2 billion. Bitcoin integration transforms SUI’s DeFi capabilities through assets like sBTC, LBTC, and WBTC. BTC holders can now lend, borrow, and earn yield directly on SUI without bridging complexities. This development opens massive capital flows from Bitcoin’s trillion-dollar market cap into SUI’s ecosystem. The integration allows Bitcoin holders to access DeFi services while maintaining exposure to BTC price movements. Lending protocols, yield farms, and liquidity pools now support Bitcoin-backed assets, expanding SUI’s addressable market beyond traditional altcoin users. Current price levels provide strategic entry before Bitcoin integration reaches full adoption. Smart money recognizes that connecting the largest cryptocurrency to SUI’s fast, scalable infrastructure creates long-term value propositions. Why HBAR’s Tokenization Utility Could Turn Bullish This Summer HBAR trades around $0.1493 despite 17% weekly decline, but technical analysts project potential moves toward $0.3965 and the psychological $1 mark if bullish conditions develop. Hedera advances tokenization capabilities through its partnership with Tokeny Solutions, a firm connected to major financial institutions including Credit Agricole and ABN AMRO. This collaboration positions HBAR as infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization. Smart money accumulates HBAR before tokenization utility reaches mainstream adoption. Current partnerships with established financial firms validate HBAR’s enterprise readiness and position the network for major growth. Conclusion Summer accumulation strategies favor projects with clear growth catalysts and mathematical advantages over speculation-driven investments. While XRP, KAS, SUI, and HBAR offer distinct utility propositions, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the most compelling risk-reward profile for strategic investors seeking exponential returns. The project’s fixed 170 billion token supply creates scarcity mechanics that established cryptocurrencies cannot match through their unlimited or corporate-controlled distribution models. Current presale pricing and bonus tokens offer immediate value multiplication before exchange listings drive price discovery. Crypto analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout leader based on community ownership, HashEx audit security, and early adoption metrics. The 100% bonus token offer ends when staking launches, creating urgency for large investors who recognize asymmetric upside potential. The bonus is available with the promo code PATRIOTS100X. Summer positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE could even generate a 100x return as the project transitions from presale to public markets through major exchange listings.

At this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin accumulation race. Prenetics announced that it purchased $20 million worth of Bitcoin, becoming the first healthcare company to establish a Bitcoin treasury. Accordingly, the company purchased 187.42 BTC through its Kraken custody account at an average price of $106,712 per Bitcoin. Prenetics CEO Danny Yeung said the following regarding the BTC purchase: “With our strengthened balance sheet of $117 million in cash, BTC, and short-term assets, we now have the financial foundation to pioneer innovative treasury management approaches, including our historic bitcoin treasury strategy. But this is just the beginning; we have the capital partnerships and the conviction to build one of the most important Bitcoin treasuries in healthcare.” Tracy Hoyos Lopez, a former prosecutor who served as Head of Strategic Initiatives at Kraken, has also joined Prenetics as an advisor. Tracy Hoyos Lopez is one of those who convinced US President Donald Trump about Bitcoin.

According to a new report from Forbes, both crypto exchanges will accept BUIDL as collateral, meaning that traders can now use the yield-bearing stablecoin as a security deposit to hedge leveraged bets, freeing up more of their capital to be used elsewhere. As stated by Michael Sonnenshein, chief operating officer at Securitize, a partner of BlackRock, “This is a major turning point. We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL – which launched in March 2024 – quickly expanded across multiple blockchains, including layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and Polygon ( POL ), and has $2.9 billion in assets. According to the report, Crypto.com will make BUIDL available for institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, while Derebit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume, which normally takes collateral in the form of Bitcoin ( BTC ), will make BUIDL available on its spot exchange. The report also notes that BUIDL may soon become available over the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, as the firm is currently in the process of acquiring Derebit.

The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision. ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark, which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrency markets are holding tight despite anxious and volatile conditions. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is trading in a volatile range but still consolidating above the 100,000 Key mark, and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), which attempted a breakout last week, saw this attempt rejected and is now back to its initial range. New highs are tough to attain for risk-assets as the market tone gets more pessimistic, however, one of the first uses for cryptocurrencies is a hedge against fiat currencies that get thrown around amid geopolitical turmoil – Something to keep in check if anything major materializes. The total market cap for cryptocurrencies is holding above $3 trillion – Keep this in check to spot any major outflows. The total market cap came shy of $3.5T as Bitcoin hit its last record highs of $112,000, but still hasn't broken the $3.70T record hit in December 2024. Total Crypto Market Cap from 2020 to Today (18/06/2025) – Source: TradingView Bitcoin, Ethereum and ETH/BTC 4H Charts Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin has seen some quite volatile moves with major selloffs and rallies within the 100,000 to 110,000 range – staying around this mark consolidates prices as more volume is traded at these levels. Monday's attempt to retest the high of the range got met with a sharp reversal in sentiment . The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision.As a non interest-yielding asset, a cut would be beneficial to the risk-asset, although the Fed is largely expected to maintain current rates for this meeting. ETF inflows are still positive, though not as strong as they were earlier in 2025 – The consistency of inflows is also assisting Bitcoin to stay bid. Ethereum 4H Chart Ethereum 4H Chart, June 18, 2025 – Source: TradingView ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark , which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support for. Prices are still consolidating in a $400 range, with lows between $2,400 and highs closer to $2,800. The second-largest cryptocurrency had failed to hold what is now the immediate 2,750 resistance zone as the more anxious mood weighed on the buying flows, preventing the breakout attempt. Any break below the Major Support 1 zone (2,385 to 2,425) would point toward a retest of the Early May levels closer to the $2,000 milestone. On the other hand, if buyers manage to sustain the current prices, a strong return to the 2,600 Pivot zone and a break of the 4H 50-period moving average ($2,621) would demand even more strength to break the immediate resistance zone and revisit early June highs – Still a possibility as Bitcoin holds above 100,000. To resume the bullish trend, the level to breach is $2,880 ; any major move mirroring the May upward shift would point at $3,440. Bulls would have to step in heavily to achieve this outcome. ETH/BTC Line Chart ETH/BTC hasn't had the occasion to break out from its current consolidation range. A descent upmove in Ethereum prices would be required to regain late 2024 levels with highs close to 0.04. The all-time highs for the spread are closer to 0.14, though even going back to 0.04 would give significant relative strength to the Ether and other altcoins. Safe Trades!

2025-06-18T19:44:22,"Arthur Hayes Questions James Wynn’s Intentions: Engagement Farming?","Arthur Hayes has questioned the motivations behind recent high-profile moves by crypto investor James Wynn. He suggested that the trader’s actions might be more driven by a desire for engagement rather than making actual earnings. Airdrop Farming Allegations In a clip shared by Laura Shin, host of the Unchained Podcast, Hayes commented on Wynn’s latest moves: “I think he farmed the airdrop. I don’t think he took a billion dollars of Delta on Bitcoin.” Wynn is a well-known investor who has gotten attention from the crypto community for his bold and high-risk trading strategies. In the past, the whale has bet more than $1 billion on Bitcoin (BTC). His most recent move saw him unstake and sell his entire holding of 126,116 HYPE tokens for approximately $4.13 million. He had originally bought the tokens on May 9 and 12 at an average price of $24.84, then sold them at $32.72 each, locking in a 31.9% profit on his $3.13 million investment. After cashing out, the trader withdrew all his USDC from Hyperliquid and announced a break from perpetual trading after booking a net loss of $17.5 million from his recent bets. What’s notable is that this sell-off came hours before Wynn’s new $99.5 million Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid . Hayes argued that if Wynn had truly taken on a billion-dollar Delta position, he wouldn’t have publicized it on social media, exposing himself to targeted attacks. The BitMEX co-founder described the move as a well-executed strategy to generate attention, speculating that Wynn would likely receive a sizable amount of HYPE tokens from the airdrop. He added that the pseudonymous trader probably didn’t lose money and may have used other accounts or split his positions across different wallets to remain delta-neutral. According to him, any losses from trading fees would also have been offset by the potential value of the tokens received in the airdrop. Hayes Questions Hyperliquid’s Future In a separate video shared by Shin, Hayes also raised a key concern about whether Hyperliquid’s current valuation and user base will be sustainable once U.S.-based giants like Coinbase and Robinhood roll out perpetual trading platforms. The 40-year-old explained that Hyperliquid currently serves users who can’t access centralized exchanges due to regulatory restrictions. However, he pointed out that once these major players start offering perpetuals with easier access, some of Hyperliquid’s 20,000 to 30,000 active traders might migrate. Hayes added that even though those platforms would probably offer lower leverage, the convenience and regulatory clarity could be enough to lure users away.

2025-06-18T19:35:33,"Bitcoin to $250K or Ozak AI to $1—Which Will Hit Its Price Target First in 2025?","Bitcoin and Ozak AI are two of the most talked-about names within the 2025 crypto forecast. While Bitcoin eyes a enormous surge to $250,000, Ozak AI, presently in its 4th presale stage at $0.005, aims for a $1 milestone. Both have sturdy narratives: Bitcoin with institutional adoption, and Ozak AI with AI-powered statistics analytics that bring innovation to the blockchain space. The big question for investors is—which one will attain its goal first? Bitcoin’s Bullish Channel and Price Levels Bitcoin’s price chart is presently forming an ascending channel, which commonly indicators continued bullish momentum. This pattern features higher highs and higher lows inside a described upward slope, regularly suggesting that any pullback is much more likely to be accompanied by means of a rebound. Within this channel, Bitcoin suggests key support levels at $57,000, $61,500, and $66,000—representing zones where buyers have formerly stepped in. On the resistance side, BTC faces hurdles at $seventy four,000, $88,000, and a psychological barrier around $100,000 before it is able to realistically method the $250K mark. While the $250K goal is aggressive, some analysts consider Bitcoin’s halving cycle and growing ETF demand could fuel that rise—even though it could take time. Ozak AI’s Disruptive Edge and Entry Price Ozak AI offers a radically different opportunity. At just $0.005, the upside potential is massive. The platform specializes in predictive AI and decentralized analytics for financial markets, combining the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), DePIN technology, and customizable Prediction Agents (PAs). These features allow it to process real-time data securely and efficiently, giving it a significant edge in the growing AI-blockchain intersection. Ozak AI vs Bitcoin: Which One Gets There First? While Bitcoin has the trust of the global financial community, it also moves with more inertia. A move from $70,000 to $250,000 would still be a historic rally, but could take several years and macro tailwinds. In contrast, Ozak AI’s tiny market cap and innovative use case could drive exponential gains in a much shorter time—especially as it garners attention from both AI and crypto communities. Both Bitcoin and Ozak AI offer compelling upside in 2025, but from a sheer percentage return and timeline standpoint, Ozak AI appears better positioned to hit its $1 target before Bitcoin touches $250,000. With AI as a megatrend and blockchain’s growing appetite for utility, Ozak AI may indeed outpace the king of crypto in the next bull cycle.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed Funds Rate will remain between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. During his speech on Wednesday, Powell said that the near-term inflation expectations have moved up fueled by tariff wars. Earlier on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reiterated that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rate and should be 2.5 points lower. What Next for the Crypto Market The crypto market has experienced heightened bearish sentiment amid the ongoing Middle East crisis. With the Fed announcing its intent to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and bonds, popularly known as Quantitative Tightening (QT), the short term bearish sentiment will likely persist. “The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the Fed noted . Meanwhile, 12 Fed officials see at least one rate cut before the end of this year while 7 Fed officials expect a no rate cut before EOY. According to LSEG data, the U.S. interest rate futures have a 71 percent chance that the Fed will cut its rate in September. As Coinpedia has previously reported , the wider crypto market will likely experience an accumulation summer in the coming months before an epic rally before the end of this year.

2025-06-18T19:30:11,"US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market Hello crypto enthusiasts! While our focus is typically on the fascinating world of digital assets, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional finance, specifically the US stock markets . Why? Because what happens on Wall Street often sends ripples through the crypto market. Today, we saw the major US indices open higher, a move that always piques the interest of investors looking for broader market sentiment cues. US Stock Markets Open Higher: The Initial Numbers Let’s get straight to the numbers reported at the open today. The key indices showed modest gains: S&P 500 : Opened up by +0.09% NASDAQ : Opened up by +0.12% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) : Opened up by +0.05% These are the initial movements as the trading day began. While seemingly small, opening trends can sometimes set the tone for the day, reflecting investor optimism or caution based on overnight news, economic data releases, or corporate announcements. Understanding the Market Correlation with the Crypto Market You might be wondering, ‘Why should I care about the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ when I’m invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum?’ Great question! There’s a growing market correlation between traditional risk-on assets, particularly technology stocks which heavily influence the NASDAQ, and the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a simple way to look at it: Risk Appetite: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk (a ‘risk-on’ environment), they tend to invest in growth stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. Positive moves in the stock market can signal this confidence. Institutional Flow: Many larger investment firms now hold positions in both traditional stocks and digital assets. Their decisions to allocate capital can impact both markets simultaneously. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation data, geopolitical events – these factors influence investor sentiment across *all* asset classes, creating synchronized movements. Therefore, a positive opening in US stock markets , especially the tech-heavy NASDAQ , is often viewed as a positive signal for the broader risk-on trade, which can sometimes benefit the crypto market . What Does This Slight Positive Movement Signify? A slight positive opening, like the one seen today with gains around 0.1%, isn’t necessarily a massive breakout, but it indicates that sellers weren’t dominant at the open. It suggests a baseline level of confidence or perhaps anticipation of favorable news later in the day. For the crypto market , this sort of steady opening in stocks is generally a neutral to slightly positive sign. It avoids the panic selling that might occur if stocks opened sharply lower, which could drag down crypto prices due to the correlation we discussed. It allows the crypto market to potentially move based on its own internal catalysts or maintain stability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can you use this information? Don’t make drastic investment decisions based solely on a stock market opening percentage. Instead, consider it as one piece of the puzzle: Monitor the Trend: Watch how the stock markets perform throughout the day. Does the initial gain hold, or do prices reverse? Identify Key Levels: For traders, observing how major indices react around key support or resistance levels can offer clues about overall market strength. Understand Sentiment: Use the stock market’s performance as a gauge for general investor risk appetite. Is the mood risk-on or risk-off? Diversify Wisely: Recognizing the correlation highlights the importance of a well-rounded investment strategy that considers how different asset classes might move together. While the S&P 500 and NASDAQ opening higher is a positive data point, remember that the crypto market also has its unique drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates. In summary, US stock markets opened slightly higher today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow all posting small gains. This positive start in traditional finance is relevant to the crypto market due to the observable market correlation , often signaling a risk-on environment. While not a guarantee of crypto price movements, it’s a useful indicator for understanding the broader financial landscape. Stay informed and continue to analyze various factors influencing your investments.

The GitHub activity affected repositories for the Keeper Wallet, potentially compromising Waves ecosystem users. Waves Protocol may be compromised by malicious code introduced in its old GitHub repositories. Investigators discovered activity in the Keeper Wallet repos after two years of no updates. The newly added code may be traced to a DPRK hacker , who seems to have gained complete credentials to the project’s GitHub. The discovery happens just at the time when Waves is trying to revive the project and kick off Waves Summer 2025. The newly introduced code may put new users at risk. 1/ ☀️ Waves Summer 2025 — Turning the Tide 🏄🏻‍♂️ The next 90 days will reshape Waves into an AI-native, L2-integrated, and institutionally anchored blockchain powerhouse. Here’s what’s ahead 👇🌊 pic.twitter.com/R5uycNgRSA — Waves 🌊 (@wavesprotocol) June 18, 2025 Waves was one of the high-profile ICOs in 2018, though it managed to raise just $18M. Waves was also prominent in the early crypto ecosystem, being one of the first protocols to offer tokenized versions of BTC. The Waves protocol was also the venue for multiple crypto scams and fake tokens. Waves was largely forgotten after its native WAVES token crashed by 93% in 2022, from a peak above $55. WAVES later sank to recent lows of $0.99. Reportedly, the project’s founder, Sasha Ivanov, used the USDN stablecoin to pump WAVES, later leading to a series of rug pulls. Waves used the chaotic early-stage DeFi, causing up to $500M in losses. However, unlike FTX, Luna, and other crashes in 2022, Waves was never investigated, and the events were forgotten. In 2025, Waves is attempting to make a return, with the double risk of financial losses and outright compromised wallets. Waves repos linked to DPRK hacking activity Researchers from Ketman threat intelligence were scanning GitHub repositories for signs of hacking and the involvement of DPRK contributors. The scans follow several cases where DPRK developers infiltrated some of the biggest crypto projects. Suspicious activity was noticed in the Keeper wallet repo, which offered access to a browser extension wallet specifically created for the Waves ecosystem. Keeper Project is a spinoff of Waves and does not share teams. The early Waves team was also involved in building the wallet. Then, in the last three weeks, the repository started to receive new code. The suspicious account had full authority and was capable of controlling the repository and even making new wallet releases. The rights to the wallet release were linked to one GitHub account , which was suspected to belong to a DPRK hacker. The account included a potentially dangerous download link for the Keeper Wallet. So far, there is no new release for Keeper, and the current wallet is considered relatively safe. However, a new release may be suspicious and cause harm, especially with the expected renewed marketing of Waves. The GitHub contributor AhegaoXXX also pushed an update that targeted and extracted wallet logs and errors to an external database, compromising privacy and being potentially malicious. The code may have capabilities to log wallet keys or phrases, though for now, it has not been added to the latest wallet release. Some of the code linked to Keeper Wallet has been published by the account of developer Maxim Smolyakov , leading the investigators to suspect some form of account takeover.

2025-06-18T19:20:11,"Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension","BitcoinWorld Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension In a development sending ripples across global political and financial circles, including those monitoring cryptocurrency market sensitivity to geopolitical events, reports have emerged suggesting a significant escalation in the long-standing Israel Iran conflict . According to accounts circulating in Israeli media, as cited by JinSe Finance, Israel is reportedly targeting the underground headquarters of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei located in Tehran. This specific report, if confirmed, marks a potentially drastic shift in the nature of confrontations between the two regional adversaries. While Israel and Iran have engaged in a ‘shadow war’ for years, involving cyberattacks, proxy conflicts, and targeted strikes on military or nuclear facilities, a direct attack on the alleged Khamenei headquarters would represent a major escalation targeting the core of Iran’s leadership. Understanding the Deep Roots of the Israel Iran Conflict To grasp the gravity of reports concerning a potential Tehran attack targeting such a high-value location, it’s crucial to understand the historical context of the animosity between Israel and Iran. Their rivalry isn’t new; it’s a complex web of ideological, political, and strategic disagreements that have shaped the Middle East for decades. Ideological Divide: Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran adopted a strongly anti-Israel stance, viewing the country as an illegitimate entity and a tool of Western influence. Regional Hegemony: Both nations vie for influence in the Middle East, supporting opposing sides in conflicts across Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. Iran’s Nuclear Program: Israel views Iran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities as an existential threat, leading to covert operations and diplomatic efforts to hinder the program. Military Posturing: Both countries maintain significant military capabilities and have engaged in various forms of indirect confrontation. This enduring tension means that any report of direct engagement, particularly one targeting leadership infrastructure, immediately heightens concerns about broader regional instability and potential spillover effects. Why Target Khamenei Headquarters? Potential Implications The choice of targeting an alleged Khamenei headquarters , especially an underground facility often associated with command and control, suggests a strategic aim beyond typical proxy skirmishes. While details remain scarce and confirmation pending, the implications of such an attack could be profound. Targeting the perceived nerve center of Iran’s leadership could theoretically aim to: Degrade Command and Control: Disrupting the ability of the Supreme Leader and his inner circle to direct military and political operations. Send a Strong Deterrent Message: Signalling Israel’s willingness to strike at the highest levels of Iranian power. Impact Morale: Undermining confidence within the Iranian leadership and potentially the population. However, such a high-profile target also comes with immense risks. The potential for a severe Iranian retaliation is significant, raising fears of a wider conflict that could engulf the region. This contributes directly to heightened Middle East tension . Verifying the Report: Challenges and Considerations It is crucial to approach reports like this with caution. The initial source cited is Israeli media, relayed by JinSe Finance. Military operations of this sensitivity are often shrouded in secrecy, and immediate, independent verification is difficult. Both sides in the Israel Iran conflict frequently engage in information warfare. Challenges in verifying the report include: Lack of official confirmation from either Israel or Iran. Difficulty in obtaining independent visual or satellite confirmation of a strike on an underground facility in a heavily guarded area like Tehran. The possibility of the report being a deliberate leak or psychological operation. Until further credible evidence emerges, the report remains just that – a report based on Israeli media claims. However, the mere circulation of such a report during a period of already elevated geopolitical risk is noteworthy and impactful. Geopolitical Risk and Market Reactions: What to Watch Major escalations in the Israel Iran conflict have a history of impacting global markets. While direct effects are often seen in oil prices due to the region’s importance in energy supply, the ripple effects can extend to other assets, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. Increased geopolitical risk often leads investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, though definitions of ‘safe haven’ can vary and are debated, especially concerning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, heightened uncertainty can also trigger risk-off sentiment, leading to sell-offs across various asset classes. Key indicators to watch in the wake of such reports include: Movements in crude oil prices. Changes in global stock market indices. Reactions in the value of traditional safe havens like gold and government bonds. The response of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing if they react as risk assets or show any safe-haven characteristics in this specific context. Analysts will be closely monitoring official statements from involved parties and international bodies, as well as any concrete evidence that emerges regarding the alleged Tehran attack . Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Readers For those tracking global events and their potential impact, especially on financial markets, the current situation underscores the importance of informed caution. Reports concerning significant developments in the Israel Iran conflict highlight the unpredictable nature of Middle East tension . Actionable insights include: Verify Sources: Do not rely on single sources, especially concerning sensitive military actions. Wait for confirmation from multiple, reputable news organizations or official statements. Understand Context: Place the report within the broader history of the Israel-Iran relationship and regional dynamics. Assess Risk Exposure: Consider how increased geopolitical risk might affect your investments, including cryptocurrencies, and whether your risk tolerance aligns with the current climate. Stay Informed: Follow developments closely, but be wary of sensationalism and unconfirmed reports. While the report of Israel targeting Khamenei headquarters is alarming, a measured approach to information and market reactions is essential. Conclusion: Awaiting Confirmation Amid Rising Tensions The report that Israel is targeting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s underground headquarters in Tehran, as cited by Israeli media and JinSe Finance, introduces a worrying dimension to the ongoing Israel Iran conflict . While confirmation of this specific Tehran attack is still needed, the report itself significantly contributes to existing Middle East tension and highlights the ever-present threat of escalating geopolitical risk in the region. The potential implications are vast, from immediate regional instability to broader impacts on global markets. As the situation develops, verifying information and understanding the complex dynamics of this rivalry remain paramount for anyone monitoring global affairs or navigating financial markets.

For Bitcoin, the stable interest rates could serve as a bullish catalyst, especially as investor sentiment shifts towards alternative stores of value. This could be a bullish signal for the BTC price rally, which is striving hard to break the barrier at $106,800. FED Rates Hold: What Does This Mean to the Crypto Market? The market analysts were sure of a rate cut today, but the US Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged. By pausing the rate hikes, the Fed is signaling that inflation may be stabilizing and economic conditions do not require tight monetary policy. These decisions reduce market uncertainty and encourage capital flow into stocks and cryptos, specifically Bitcoin. Meanwhile, President Trump called the FED Chair, Jerome Powell, ‘Stupid’ for not lowering the rates. He said that the FED has kept the borrowing cost too high, which has been costing America billions of dollars. Moreover, the President believes the rates should have been two interest points lower. The FED currently holds interest rates between the range of 4.25% and 4.50%. While Bitcoin has held stable since the early trading hours, it is now experiencing a sell-off. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? Markets remain on edge as Powell’s cautious tone keeps rate cut hopes in check—expectations are locked in for no move. However, the traders are glued to micro-signals in Fed projections for any dovish tilt. Bitcoin and altcoins chopped on FOMC week, with volumes spiking around Powell’s Q&A and macro narrative shifts. Besides, Bitcoin price remains in an indecisive spot after the FED’s interest rate tone. Powell’s confidence in macro strength is fueling bullish sentiment, but the technicians flash caution. ETF inflow and supply crunch are supporting the broader uptrend, but the short-term chart shows an oversold RSI and a bearish MACD cross.

2025-06-18T19:06:21,"Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last?","Once deemed too volatile and speculative for serious investors – Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable asset for mainstream portfolios, according to Philippe Laffont. The founder of tech-focused hedge fund Coatue Management explained the reason why markets have had a change of heart about BTC as he spoke at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at north of $105,000, which is more than 50% above its year-to-date low on April 9, only days after President Trump’s tariffs announcement. Lower volatility is increasing institutional support for Bitcoin According to Philippe Laffont, institutional attitude towards Bitcoin is improving mostly because the asset’s volatility, which historically deterred firms like Coatue from building a position, is now declining, and that too, significantly. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into BTC is shrinking, he said, referring to the asset’s beta – a measure of its volatility relative to the broader market. Lower beta, in his view, is making Bitcoin more accessible and even attractive for cautious investors in 2025. Additionally, the growing presence of institutional names, particularly big ones like BlackRock, that’s even launched a Spot Bitcoin ETF is being seen as a major sign of maturity in the crypto space. Once a fringe asset, BTC is now being legitimized by major financial institutions, which is helping reduce perceived risks, Laffont added. Comparative performance is also contributing to changing investor perceptions – Bitcoin has demonstrated relative resilience in recent macroeconomic shocks. For example, when markets reacted to President Trump’s tariff announcement in April , Bitcoin lost only 5% versus a wider 6% decline seen in the Nasdaq Composite. This decoupling from traditional tech-heavy indices suggests BTC may now offer diversification benefits rather than simply tracking risk-on sentiment. BTC long-term holding behaviour signals growing confidence Another telling indicator is how investors are treating their holdings after buying Bitcoin, Laffont noted as he addressed the Summit. The number of wallets that held bitcoin for over a month and then sold out entirely has declined significantly, which implies a shift toward a long-term investment mindset among holders, rather than speculative day trading. Bitcoin currently makes up less than 1% of the global net worth. According to Philippe Laffont, if the assets continue gaining credibility, “it has to become more central” to diversified portfolios. While he once overlooked the cryptocurrency’s potential, Laffont now embraces one of its simplest characteristics: “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time.” Bitcoin is currently up nearly 100% versus its 52-week low, but the hedge fund manager continues to see significant further upside in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He concluded on a rhetorical question: “why wouldn’t everyone have one, two, three or 4% of assets in Bitcoin that … protects you against inflation ?” The post Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last? appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/18/why-is-bitcoin-becoming-central-to-investment-portfolios-and-will-it-last/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Crypto|North America|World|Bitcoin|USA",cryptocompare

Lion Group Holding Ltd, listed on Nasdaq and offering a trading platform for a suite of products that includes total return swaps, contract-for-difference and over-the-counter stock options, announced its move on June 18, 2025. That’s just a day after Eyenovia, a U.S.-based ophthalmic technology firm, said it planned to deploy $50 million into a Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) treasury initiative. The news hasn’t catalyzed fresh gains for HYPE price, notably amid prevailing market conditions . However, Eyenovia and LGHL highlight the growing institutional interest in the native token of Hyperliquid, a decentralized finance-focused blockchain and platform. LGHL eyes Hyperliquid (HYPE) treasury with initial $600m According to Lion Group, the objective is clear: build the largest Hyperliquid treasury in the world. Eyenovia has expressed similar ambitions, hinting at a potential race to become the “Strategy of HYPE.” Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) remains the top corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet among publicly-listed companies. The U.S.-based firm has inspired a whole range of BTC treasury firms – with Ethereum, XRP and Solana now seeing similar trends.

LGHL is relaunching its crypto operations to align with its entry into the DeFi ecosystem, noting in a press release: The company is relaunching its crypto operations amid the quest to tap into the decentralized finance ecosystem, LGHL noted in a press release. “Hyperliquid represents a natural extension of LGHL’s existing derivatives business into decentralized markets, and reflects our conviction that decentralized on-chain execution is the future of trading,” Wilson Wang, chief executive officer of LGHL, said. “We view protocols like HYPE, with decentralized sequencing, as foundational to building scalable DeFi systems.” The company is also considering secondary listings on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange, which would make it the first HYPE treasury firm publicly listed in Asia. LGHL also eyes Solana, Sui treasury initiaives According to Lion Group Holding CEO Wilson Wang, the launch of the HYPE treasury isn’t the company’s only plan. An on-chain vision also includes treasury reserves built with other layer-1 tokens. That means plans for the strategic accumulation of Solana ( SOL ) and Sui ( SUI ). If this happens, the company will use BitGo to custody and stake its SOL and SUI. “We may also allocate to Solana (SOL), a leader in consumer-facing applications, and Sui (SUI), a performant, composable layer-1 with recent backing from Eric Trump’s World Liberty Financial – both forming key pillars to our treasury strategy focused on execution-first protocols,” Wang noted. SOL is the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap with over $76 billion. Meanwhile, HYPE and SUI are currently the 11th and 12th largest with $12.9 billion and $9.4 billion respectively.

2025-06-18T19:00:26,"Stablecoins market cap hits an all-time high of $256 billion","The total stablecoins market capitalization surged to an all-time high on Wednesday, data shows that the coins recorded $256 billion, up 22% this year. This surge has been fueled by the US Senate’s approval of the GENIUS Act by a 68-30 vote, marking the first major crypto bill to pass the Senate. Although it still needs approval from the House and President Trump, the bill has made it through the hardest steps. Stablecoin market cap in 5 years Stablecoins have become a core part of the crypto industry. In Q1 2025 alone, stablecoins accounted for 28% of total crypto transaction volume. Meanwhile, USDT continues to dominate the market, accounting for over half of the total market capitalization at 155 billion. USDC follows with a market capitalization of 61 billion. Investors plan to launch more stablecoins As the bill progresses, Trump is getting more personally involved with stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, a crypto company backed by President Trump and his sons, together with BitGo, has launched its own stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD1). However, the Genius Act bans members of Congress and their families from earning profits from stablecoins, but not President Trump and his family. This omission has irked some Democrats and slowed progress on the legislation this spring. Many big companies, from rumored giant lenders to mega stores, are already thinking about whether to make their own coins. For instance, at a Morgan Stanley conference, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan talked about the company’s plans for a stablecoin last week. “We’re working with the industry, working individually,” he said. This month, Bank of America and other large banks got together to discuss the possibility of launching a collaborative stablecoin network. Also, last week, the Wall Street Journal said that Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are looking into stablecoin possibilities. “While we continuously explore new payment technologies in efforts to support our customers, we are not piloting any programs and do not currently have any plans in place to issue our own stablecoin,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Some Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have raised these concerns. They have cited that the bill will allow big tech companies like Amazon or Meta (META) start their own stablecoins. However, Disparte pointed out that the bill says any tech company that wants to make a stablecoin must first get permission from a special committee at the Treasury Department. The rest of the crypto market takes a dip Circle is a sign of growing investor enthusiasm for stablecoins as the legislation advances in Congress. Its stock has soared roughly 400% since its debut day of trading on June 5. The crypto market expects stablecoins to rally more after the bill passes. The head of that department, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, also has high hopes for what the legislation may mean. He told lawmakers last week that the legislation could help push the US stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028. Meanwhile, the global crypto market continues to tumble as escalating tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to flee riskier assets. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by almost 2% over the last day to stand at $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume also took a hit of around 9% to drop to $121 billion. The biggest crypto token, BTC, has not done much. It has remained steady at the $104k level. This suggests that traders might take a halt now.

2025-06-18T18:45:51,"Alex Mashinsky Barred From Receiving Any Assets From Celsius Bankruptcy Claims","Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky will not receive any assets from the collapsed crypto lending platform’s bankruptcy claims. Newly filed court documents indicate Mashinsky withdrew his claims in light of his criminal sentencing last month. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after its native token, CEL, plummeted by 99%, and it was unable to fulfill withdrawals. Mashinsky was arrested in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud last December. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said the Celsius founder falsely represented the lender as a safe and secure platform and exaggerated its potential for profitability, greatly inflating its user base. Last month, a US district judge sentenced Mashinsky to 12 years in prison. After the sentencing, US Attorney Jay Clayton said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used customer funds to place risky bets and profited tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. “America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply, and the SDNY (Southern District of New York) will hold those who flout them accountable for their crimes.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T18:41:00,"‘Next Parabolic Move’ for Bitcoin Approaching As Two Historically Reliable Macro Indicators Flash Green, According to Analyst","A closely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be on the cusp of its next explosive rally, as two key macroeconomic indicators with a track record of accurately predicting bull runs flash green. In a newly released macro report , pseudonymous analyst TechDev highlights the copper-to-gold ratio and M2 money’s supply year-over-year change as critical signals pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has begun to trend upward – a move TechDev notes has historically preceded BTC bull markets by several months. “As of mid-2025, the ratio has stopped declining and is stabilizing, even showing signs of turning higher. This suggests that investors are beginning to anticipate recovery. If copper begins to outperform gold in the coming quarters, it would signal a bottoming of the business cycle – precisely the kind of macro regime change that supports a bitcoin bull run.” Source: TechDev And the analyst says global M2 money supply – a broad measure of liquidity in the world financial system – has flipped from negative to positive annual growth, also a signal that he says has preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic phases by 6–10 months, suggesting a strong probability that another upward cycle is imminent. “When global M2 is rising, Bitcoin typically follows suit. This dynamic is visible across multiple cycles. In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID crisis, for instance, global M2 surged at the fastest rate in modern history. Bitcoin responded by rallying from under $10,000 to over $60,000 in just over a year. Conversely, when central banks tighten policy as they did in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, global M2 flattens or contracts. During this time, Bitcoin struggled. Its price declined sharply in tandem with falling liquidity, reinforcing that it is not sentiment but capital flow that drives crypto price action. As liquidity dried up, so did Bitcoin’s momentum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
