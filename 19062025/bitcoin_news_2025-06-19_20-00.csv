2025-06-19T17:44:28,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump Calls for Massive US Crypto Investment","Spot volumes climb whenever Bitcoin dips, and fresh stablecoin prints hint that sidelined capital is re-entering the market with purpose. Although Bitcoin has drifted into a cooling pattern, on-chain wallet growth remains steady, a classic mark of quiet accumulation. What traders lacked was a spark to convert that patience into conviction. They found it in Donald Trump‚Äôs newest volley of pro-crypto remarks. The President framed the current consolidation as a launch pad rather than a warning sign. His comments have already begun to ripple through order books, lifting depth and nudging funding rates higher as market participants position for a fresh swing in the short term. Why Trump‚Äôs Message Reshapes Global Sentiment When Washington speaks, liquidity desks from Frankfurt to Singapore reach for the volume knob. The United States still hosts the world‚Äôs deepest capital pools, and its policy choices shape the compliance playbooks of many other jurisdictions. That is why Donald Trump‚Äôs Truth Social post on 18 June resonated far outside American borders. The screenshot shows him celebrating a Senate vote that pushed a comprehensive digital-assets bill through the chamber, calling it ‚Äúpure genius‚Äù and vowing to sign it the moment the House sends a clean version to his desk. Though the text does not specify the title, aides have hinted at a framework focused on strict asset backing for payment tokens, streamlined federal licensing, and clear guardrails for consumer protection. In practical terms, it would give banks and fintech firms a green light to launch fully collateralized dollar tokens, unlocking fresh demand for blockchain rails and likely accelerating institutional flows into Bitcoin as the benchmark collateral asset. Trump paired that optimism with another jab at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates unchanged. Lower borrowing costs would amplify the impact of any regulatory breakthrough by reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as Bitcoin. The combination of legislative momentum and pressure for easier monetary policy has already brightened derivative sentiment. Funding flipped positive on several Asian exchanges within hours, and European desks reported a sudden uptick in spot inquiries from family offices. If the bill becomes law, other governments are expected to follow with parallel initiatives, turning domestic development into a global adoption catalyst. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump‚Äôs Stance Could Trigger Global Interest Surge BTC Bull BTC Bull offers a creative way for accessing Bitcoin upside without the complexities of direct leverage or derivative exposure. Its design hinges on a supply adjustment mechanism that increases token issuance as Bitcoin‚Äôs price reaches defined thresholds. The concept is simple: every time Bitcoin reaches a particular price milestone, every BTCBULL token holder stands to win airdrops. What sets BTC Bull apart is its compatibility with long-term capital, especially from investors who prefer on-chain exposure with built-in directional acceleration. It offers a path that avoids liquidation risk and removes counterparty dependencies while still amplifying returns when BTC trends upward. Its emphasis on conservative treasury management helps insulate the protocol during choppy or sideways markets. While it does mainly seem like a meme coin, its utility is creative and well thought of, for the long term, a combination that really puts a heavy interest on the token. So for those looking to position ahead of structural growth in digital assets, BTC Bull provides a well-architected, autonomous exposure layer built specifically to enhance directional returns without the overhead of traditional financial tools. SUBBD SUBBD is built for creators who seek full control over how they monetize content, manage memberships, and engage communities. It provides an alternative to traditional subscription platforms by allowing each creator to deploy their own branded access token. These tokens grant tiered entry to private content feeds, community perks, and real-time engagement features, all embedded within a single on-chain ecosystem. Its utility lies in how the platform handles revenue and data ownership. Creators earn income instantly into self-custodied wallets, without relying on third-party payout schedules or enduring platform commissions. At the same time, content access is governed by smart contracts that enforce entitlements transparently: viewership, renewals, and tipping mechanisms are all automated, cutting down on manual moderation or billing disputes. What makes SUBBD particularly powerful is its backend modularity. It can support everything from gated video streams and course content to event-based ticketing or even exclusive DAO voting rights tied to creator governance. The platform includes built-in compliance tools like region-specific access restrictions, tax summary generation, and anti-bot verification, all of which are features that make it viable for scale and cross-border use without adding friction. 99Bitcoins , a leading educational YouTube channel, also vouched for the token‚Äôs potential, dubbing it as a 100x gem. Its utility is well aligned with a maturing digital economy, where creators are moving toward direct relationships with their audiences, disintermediation of platforms, and decentralized income channels. SUBBD equips them with exactly that: programmable infrastructure that supports sustainable, creator-first monetization while maintaining the flexibility to evolve with future digital payment frameworks and audience interaction models. Solaxy Solaxy is a layer-two blockchain that bridges two of the most significant ecosystems in crypto: Ethereum‚Äôs robust security layer and Solana‚Äôs high-throughput infrastructure. Rather than relying on a monolithic chain or compromising between performance and decentralization, Solaxy integrates the best of both through a dual-verification architecture. Transactions execute quickly on a Solana-compatible layer, while periodic proofs anchor finality to Ethereum‚Äôs base layer, offering scalability without compromising the integrity of historical data. The native currency is the SOLX token, which powers transactions, prioritization, and resource allocation through a dynamic fee structure that adjusts based on real-time network load. Developers are able to build applications that inherit Ethereum-grade security while benefiting from the low latency required for high-frequency interactions like trading, payments, or gaming. The protocol includes a compiler toolset that allows Ethereum-based projects to port their smart contracts into Solaxy‚Äôs environment with minimal friction. This enables Solaxy to serve as a migration hub for developers looking to expand to faster execution environments without leaving Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem entirely. Projects gain not only speed but also broader interoperability, since assets and data can move between chains with native compatibility. Solaxy‚Äôs architecture supports applications that require fast confirmation times but still demand secure audit trails, such as digital payments, decentralized identity systems, or real-time marketplaces. It is not just another scaling solution, but also an execution layer optimized for modern use cases where speed, security, and cross-chain access must coexist by design. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token sits as the native token of a self-custody suite that treats the wallet as more than a key manager. Within the application, every balance, network bridge, and decentralized exchange route is abstracted into a single account view, allowing users to shift assets or stake liquidity through guided flows that feel closer to standard banking than to protocol dashboards. Holding BEST is the mechanism that unlocks those features. When a user routes trades through the in-app aggregator, a portion of the fee is automatically converted to BEST and redistributed to active stakers. This circular capture model turns each user into a partial beneficiary of aggregate network activity. BEST also reduces gas expenditure for supported chains through a pooled rebate fund, which becomes especially powerful when congestion peaks during market expansions. In practice, the token acts as both a participation credential and a cost-control tool. üî• Over $13M Raised and Counting! üî•Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:‚úÖ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app‚úÖ Buy and bridge across chains in one place‚úÖ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v ‚Äî Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 It has already raised upwards of $13 million, and could very likely be listed across many major exchanges shortly. Token holders can commit BEST to weight their vote on listings, interface upgrades, or new chain integrations. Because voting power decays if tokens sit idle, the model encourages continuous engagement rather than one-off governance events. That dynamic keeps development priorities aligned with features that drive real usage, such as native support for regulated stablecoin rails that may emerge if current policy discussions mature into law. Finally, a custodial-agnostic recovery layer is secured by an insurance pool funded with a fraction of swap fees settled in BEST. This reserve backs optional coverage for lost-key events, addressing a longstanding adoption hurdle by blending traditional assurance concepts with transparent on-chain accounting. Conclusion When national leadership not only acknowledges digital assets but actively pushes for their integration into financial policy, it forces a reassessment of what the next cycle might look like. For investors, the window ahead may favor tokens that do more than move with the market. The ones tied to actual mechanics like settlement, access, scalability, or utility stand to gain from a climate where functionality is finally being given the green light. The projects covered above each offer something grounded in purpose. Not hype, not noise, just well-engineered frameworks that may find stronger footing as the broader environment becomes more accommodating. With a new chapter possibly opening, these are the kinds of assets that deserve a closer look. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-19T17:35:10,"Majority of Russian miners are operating outside the law","Efforts to legalize the activities of crypto miners in Russia haven‚Äôt been particularly fruitful and only about 30% have so far registered with the country‚Äôs tax authority. The assessment comes from the finance ministry in Moscow, which says it‚Äôs working to bring the rest of the growing industry out of the shadows, the main purpose of regulating the sector. Majority of Russian miners minting outside the law Less than a third of all Russian entities involved in cryptocurrency mining have been added to the special register of the Federal Tax Service (FNS) which allows them to operate legally, according to the Ministry of Finance (Minfin). The legalization of the Bitcoin-related business, which has been expanding in the energy-rich Russian Federation, is far from complete, Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov told Russia‚Äôs state-owned news agency TASS. ‚ÄúOur general approach, when we introduced regulation, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible,‚Äù Chebeskov reminded. Also quoted by Russian crypto media outlets Bits.media and RBC Crypto, he admitted: ‚ÄúSo far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the FNS, and this process is still far from complete.‚Äù The Minfin official emphasized his department will continue work to legalize the remaining two-thirds of the crypto mining sector. These efforts started last year when Russia adopted legislation designed to regulate the crypto activity. Since the new law entered into force in November 2024, companies and individual entrepreneurs can mine legally as long as they register with the Russian tax authority and pay due taxes . Private citizens minting digital currencies are not required to do that, as long as they use less than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. The FNS registry was launched in January and by April 1, registration entries had reached 722, including 116 ‚Äúmining infrastructure operators,‚Äù or providers of hosting services and data center operators. Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Tatarstan account of the highest number legal miners in Russia. Fines and crypto seizure await illegal crypto miners Many miners prefer to remain in the shadow economy as they fear criminal prosecution over illegally imported equipment, RBC noted in its report. According to the business news portal, an amnesty is already being discussed between legislators and industry members. Those who decide to continue to mine illegally are going to face heavy fines and other punitive measures, including confiscation of the minted cryptocurrency. According to amendments to Russia‚Äôs Code of Administrative Offenses, currently under consideration, the monetary penalties may reach 2 million rubles ($25,000) for companies and 400,000 rubles ($5,000) for private individuals. Russia mulls lower electricity rates for legal mining farms Illegal, also called ‚Äúgray‚Äù crypto miners in Russia have been blamed for increasing electricity deficits in a number of Russian regions. Authorities have reacted by banning all mining in almost a dozen territories and subjects of the Russian Federation. Critics say this hurts legal mining businesses, bringing down tax revenues and electricity sales. ‚ÄúWe need to regulate mining, not ban it,‚Äù Russia‚Äôs Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabchak was quoted as stating on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Speaking to TASS, he elaborated: ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Energy sees the point not in prohibition, but in more subtle regulation of mining.‚Äù Earlier in June, Grabchak told reporters that his department favors regulatory changes that will help avoid restrictions on cryptocurrency mining in some parts of the country and is working on incentives to attract miners to regions with surplus energy. Now he revealed these may include offering take-or-pay tariffs for the electricity consumed by legal mining farms. He noted the rates ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be much lower, but they will be more long-term.‚Äù In May, he hinted on adding miners to a separate category of consumers enjoying lower energy prices that will apply across all Russian regions.

2025-06-19T17:20:55,"XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions","BitcoinWorld XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions Global events have a powerful ripple effect, and the world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Recently, the escalating situation involving Middle East tensions has sent shivers through financial markets, including the digital asset space. For many, the focus is squarely on how this uncertainty impacts their portfolios, and specifically, what it means for the XRP price . What Are XRP Traders Doing Amid the Uncertainty? According to reports, particularly from DL News, XRP traders are reacting to the geopolitical climate by bracing for potential declines. The derivatives exchange Deribit has reportedly seen increased activity from traders taking bearish positions on XRP. This means they are essentially betting that the XRP price will fall further. These traders are anticipating a notable drop, with some positioning for an additional 5% decrease in XRP‚Äôs value. This isn‚Äôt just random speculation; it reflects a growing bearish sentiment specifically targeting XRP in the wake of heightened global risk. Why are XRP traders so sensitive to this news? Geopolitical instability often leads investors to move away from riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, while sometimes seen as uncorrelated, frequently react negatively to events that threaten global stability or signal potential economic disruption. How Are Middle East Tensions Shaking the Crypto Market? The connection between Middle East tensions and the crypto market might not be immediately obvious, but it‚Äôs a significant one. Major geopolitical events introduce uncertainty and increase risk aversion among investors worldwide. When tensions escalate: Investors seek safety: Capital tends to flow out of assets perceived as risky (like stocks and cryptocurrencies) and into safer havens (like government bonds or gold). Economic outlook darkens: Conflict can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, and generally create a less favorable environment for economic growth, dampening enthusiasm for speculative assets. Policy responses: Governments and central banks might signal policy shifts in response to the crisis, further influencing market direction. The recent signals from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding potential U.S. involvement added another layer of complexity and concern, amplifying the market‚Äôs reaction. This isn‚Äôt just affecting XRP; the broader crypto market , including giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has also experienced declines, demonstrating the systemic impact of these global events. Decoding the Bearish Sentiment: Why Are Traders Betting Down? The prevailing bearish sentiment among XRP traders isn‚Äôt solely tied to geopolitical fears, although that‚Äôs a major catalyst right now. Bearish sentiment reflects a collective expectation that an asset‚Äôs price is likely to fall. Several factors contribute to this outlook: Geopolitical Risk: As discussed, escalating Middle East tensions are a primary driver, increasing overall market fear. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession can contribute to risk-off attitudes. Technical Analysis: Traders often look at price charts and patterns. If XRP‚Äôs chart shows signs of weakness or breaks key support levels, it can reinforce a bearish view. Market Contagion: When major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin experience declines, it often pulls altcoins like XRP down with them, regardless of their individual fundamentals. The weakness in the broader crypto market contributes significantly to the negative outlook for XRP. Specific XRP Factors: While less prominent in this specific report, ongoing regulatory discussions or developments related to Ripple‚Äôs legal status can also influence sentiment around the XRP price . The accumulation of these factors can create a powerful wave of bearish sentiment , leading traders to open short positions or sell their holdings in anticipation of lower prices. Broader Crypto Market Reaction: Is It Just XRP? While the report highlights XRP traders specifically, it‚Äôs crucial to understand that the reaction is not isolated. The entire crypto market is interconnected and sensitive to major external shocks. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often dictates the overall trend. When Bitcoin sees selling pressure due to global events or macro fears, altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, and others typically follow suit, often with greater volatility. The declines observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum following the news signals underscore that the current downturn is a market-wide phenomenon, triggered by the same underlying fear driven by Middle East tensions . This collective movement reinforces the bearish sentiment across the board, impacting the XRP price as part of the larger ecosystem. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for XRP Traders Trading during times of heightened volatility and bearish sentiment can be challenging, but informed decisions are key. Here are some actionable insights for XRP traders : Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the XRP price moves against your position. Stay Informed, Avoid Panic: Keep track of geopolitical developments and market analysis, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or hype. Understand Middle East tensions are a factor, but not the only one. Consider Diversification: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. While focusing on XRP, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different assets or even different sectors within crypto. Understand Derivatives Risk: If you are trading derivatives like those on Deribit, be acutely aware of the leverage involved and the potential for rapid losses, especially with significant bearish sentiment in play. Look for Opportunities (with caution): Volatility can present opportunities for those with a strategy. This might involve shorting (betting on price decline) if you are experienced, or identifying potential entry points if you believe the long-term outlook for the XRP price remains positive despite short-term headwinds. However, timing the market is extremely difficult. Re-evaluate Your Thesis: Step back and consider if the current situation fundamentally changes your long-term view on XRP and the crypto market . For many, observing from the sidelines during extreme uncertainty might be the most prudent strategy. The goal is to preserve capital and be ready when clearer trends emerge. Summary: Geopolitics Casts a Shadow on XRP and the Crypto Market In conclusion, the report highlighting XRP traders positioning for declines underscores the significant impact of global events, particularly Middle East tensions , on the digital asset space. The growing bearish sentiment is a direct response to the increased risk and uncertainty introduced by the geopolitical climate and broader market reactions. While XRP price is specifically mentioned due to trader positioning on platforms like Deribit, this reflects a wider trend affecting the entire crypto market , including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Navigating these turbulent times requires careful consideration, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of how external factors can influence the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading.

2025-06-19T17:00:10,"Why The June 22 Date Is Important As Bitcoin Price Flirts With $100,000","The Bitcoin price action is currently testing investors‚Äô nerves as it hovers around $100,000. While it flirts with this psychological level, analysts are highlighting June 22, 2025, as a key date for potential volatility. Backed by both historical volatility patterns and technical indicators, this date is gearing up to be a critical window for Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility On June 22 Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as it trades above the $100,000 mark, with technical signals identified by TradingView expert ‚ÄòreadCrypto‚Äô aligning around a critical time frame‚Äî-June 22. The chart analysis shows that June 22 is an important date, signaling the projected start of Bitcoin‚Äôs next volatility window, with a potential to break out or break down depending on how the flagship cryptocurrency reacts to key support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,731, close to a pivotal confluence range between $104,463 and $106,133‚Äîa zone highlighted as a structural mid-point. This area is defined by the DOM (60) and a Heikin-Ashi high point on the price chart, marking the formation of a recent upper boundary. Moreover, the lower end of the range sits around $99,705, which is the HA-High support level, where the price has previously been tested but not yet broken. According to the analyst, the June 22 date is important because it coincides with the confluence of key price levels with the M-Signal indicator on the weekly chart. This indicator is currently rising and aligning near the $99,705 HA-high level. If Bitcoin falls below this level, it could signal the start of a deeper corrective move, possibly toward the monthly M-Signal line or even the $89,294 region, corresponding with the 2.618 Fibonacci. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above this level and breaks out of the $108,316 resistance, momentum could shift back to the upside. The analyst has set upper bullish targets near $109,598 and $111,696, reflecting the final resistance zone before new highs. Support Zones And Momentum Indicate Tense Standoff Moving past readCrypto‚Äôs volatility-driven projection, the TradingView analyst‚Äôs Bitcoin chart shows that the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) oscillator remains below the zero line. This suggests that despite recent gains, selling pressure may still be dominating the broader market. However, the histogram in the chart shows signs of waning momentum on the sell side. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This divergence aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs weakening Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates momentum may be cooling. The low OBV readings, combined with the recent bounce from a lower support range, also underscore an intense standoff within the market. If Bitcoin breaks below the Heikin Ashi high point at $99,705, a retest of new lows at $89,294 is more than likely. Until then, readCrypto‚Äôs analysis shows that all eyes are on the $104,000 to $106,000 zone. The area between $99,705 and $108,316 now defines the high-boundary consolidation range. A confirmed move outside this range, mainly triggered during the June 21-13 window, could dictate Bitcoin‚Äôs next major move.

The Berwyn, Alberta-based facility was unveiled with BlueFlare Energy and is now running on 425 kilowatts (kW), delivering a hashrate of 32 petahashes per second (PH/s). Stranded gas refers to natural gas that is not able to be delivered to market due to logistics or economics. AgriFORCE‚Äôs process enables unused gas to be turned into computer power without having to navigate the years-long permitting and infrastructure bottleneck. Two Additional Sites Planned Across Alberta AgriFORCE has executed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare Energy to expand its model of mining into two new sites in Oyen and Hinton, Alberta. The new sites would be a carbon copy of the Berwyn model, further expanding the company‚Äôs foray into gas-powered crypto mining. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt wait on permits or grid upgrades ‚Äî we convert gas to compute in weeks, not years,‚Äù CEO Jolie Kahn said. AgriFORCE‚Äôs Bitcoin Strategy: Hold and Expand The company revealed that it has mined already 7 Bitcoin with an approximate value of $735,000 from operations in Alberta and Ohio. The mined BTC of up to 50% of AgriFORCE will be reserved in treasury while the balance will be employed to facilitate operational expansion. The company may also utilize up to 50% of funds raised to directly buy Bitcoin. Stock Performance and Financial Outlook AgriFORCE shares (AGRI) rose 1.85% to finish trading on Tuesday at $1.10. While there was the daily gain, the company is down over 53% year to date, according to Google Finance. Still, the company produced solid financials in 2024, with revenue jumping 317% and net profit increasing 66% year over year. Renewable Energy Picks Up Speed in Crypto Mining AgriFORCE is part of a broader trend within the crypto mining industry: shifting to alternative and renewable sources of energy. According to TheMinerMag, the price of one BTC to produce in Q1 2025 hit $64,000 and will rise to $70,000 by the end of Q2. With increased energy prices, miners are looking more towards renewable resources.

2025-06-19T16:30:00,"Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum‚Äôs Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum‚Äôs Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift Is the much-anticipated Altcoin recovery finally on the horizon? For many investors holding various digital assets, this is the burning question. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, attention is increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as the potential catalyst for broader market gains. Why is Ethereum Price Key to Altcoin Recovery? According to insights shared by experts like Micha√´l van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, the fate of many altcoins is currently tied directly to Ethereum‚Äôs performance. He suggests that for investors to see their altcoin positions return to profitability or achieve significant gains, ETH needs to demonstrate stronger momentum and resilience in the market. Think of it this way: Ethereum is the largest altcoin by market cap and serves as the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other altcoins built on its blockchain or EVM-compatible chains. When Ethereum is strong, it signals health and activity in this ecosystem, which often spills over positively into the performance of associated altcoins. Van de Poppe‚Äôs view highlights a crucial point: without a robust ETH showing, the capital needed to fuel significant rallies in smaller altcoins might remain stagnant or exit the market. A rising Ethereum price can increase confidence, liquidity, and risk appetite, all essential ingredients for an Altcoin season . Entering the ‚ÄòEthereum Phase‚Äô of the Crypto Market Adding weight to the narrative, on-chain analyst Willy Woo recently posited that the broader Crypto market is transitioning into what he terms an ‚ÄòEthereum phase‚Äô. This suggests a potential shift in market dynamics where Ethereum, rather than just Bitcoin, becomes the primary driver or indicator of market sentiment and direction. Micha√´l van de Poppe agrees with Woo‚Äôs assessment of this fundamental shift. However, he notes a common disconnect: many investors remain unaware of this transition. They are still influenced by a lingering ‚Äòmarkets are bad‚Äô mindset, perhaps conditioned by previous downturns, and haven‚Äôt fully grasped Ethereum‚Äôs growing influence and potential leadership role in the current cycle. What might an ‚ÄòEthereum phase‚Äô entail? It could mean: Increased focus on Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals (e.g., staking yields, network upgrades, EIPs). Higher correlation between ETH and many altcoins compared to the traditional BTC-altcoin correlation. Ethereum‚Äôs price movements acting as a leading indicator for specific sectors within the crypto market (like DeFi or NFTs). Greater institutional interest specifically in Ethereum as a programmable settlement layer and yield-bearing asset. Understanding this potential phase shift is vital for investors looking to navigate the coming months and capitalize on potential opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Examining the ETH Price Prediction Trajectory Beyond its fundamental role, the technical price action of Ethereum is also generating significant interest. Crypto analyst Ted has drawn parallels between Ethereum‚Äôs current trajectory and Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price movement during its 2017‚Äì2021 cycle. This comparison is significant because Bitcoin‚Äôs 2017-2021 period included its massive bull run. If Ethereum were to follow a similar path, it could imply substantial upside potential from current levels. Ted‚Äôs analysis suggests that a real parabolic move ‚Äì a rapid, accelerating increase in price ‚Äì could commence once ETH decisively breaks and sustains above the $4,000 mark. Hitting $4,000 would not only represent a significant psychological and technical resistance break but would also bring ETH closer to its previous all-time high. Surpassing this level could trigger a wave of positive sentiment, potentially leading to further price discovery and reinforcing the idea that the market is indeed entering a more bullish phase, supportive of Altcoin recovery . Challenges and Considerations While the outlook linking ETH strength to altcoin gains is compelling, it‚Äôs important to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile. Unforeseen macroeconomic events or regulatory news could impact ETH and altcoins negatively. Bitcoin Dominance: While the narrative suggests an ‚ÄòEthereum phase‚Äô, Bitcoin‚Äôs influence is still substantial. A strong BTC rally that pulls liquidity from altcoins could temporarily hinder the ‚ÄòEthereum phase‚Äô thesis. Execution Risks: While Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals are strong, the successful execution of future upgrades is crucial for its long-term health and appeal. Altcoin Specific Risks: Even with a strong ETH, individual altcoins face unique risks related to their technology, team, adoption, and competition. Investors should conduct their own research and not solely rely on broad market trends or predictions. Diversification and risk management remain paramount. Conclusion: Watching Ethereum for the Next Big Move The consensus among several prominent analysts points towards Ethereum as the primary driver for the next wave of Altcoin recovery . From its fundamental role in the crypto ecosystem to its technical price trajectory mirroring past bull runs, ETH‚Äôs performance is seen as the crucial barometer for whether the broader Crypto market can enter a truly bullish phase. The idea of an ‚ÄòEthereum phase‚Äô, where ETH leads the charge, is gaining traction, even if many retail investors haven‚Äôt fully recognized it yet. While price predictions like the move past $4,000 for a parabolic run offer exciting potential, it‚Äôs essential to remain aware of market dynamics and individual asset risks. Ultimately, for those waiting for an Altcoin season , keeping a close eye on Ethereum price action and network developments appears to be the most strategic approach.

2025-06-19T16:20:00,"Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill Big news out of the Buckeye State! The Ohio House of Representatives has taken a significant step that could make small cryptocurrency transactions much simpler for residents. In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community, lawmakers in Ohio have passed a bill aiming to exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from capital gains tax. This development is particularly relevant for anyone engaging in frequent, small-value trades or using crypto for minor purchases in the state. Understanding the Proposed Ohio Crypto Tax Exemption At the heart of this legislative effort is the desire to ease the tax burden and reporting complexity associated with small cryptocurrency transactions. Currently, under federal and typically state law, selling, trading, or using cryptocurrency for goods and services can trigger a taxable event. If the value of the crypto has increased since you acquired it, you could owe capital gains tax on that appreciation, even on very small amounts. The bill recently passed by the Ohio House seeks to create an exemption for this. Specifically, it targets transactions where the gain realized is less than $200. This means if you buy crypto, and later sell it, trade it for another crypto, or use it to buy something, and the profit (the difference between the sale price and your cost basis) is less than $200, that specific gain would be exempt from state capital gains tax in Ohio. This is a crucial detail ‚Äì the exemption applies to the *gain*, not the total transaction value. Let‚Äôs break down what this exemption aims to address: Micro-Transactions: Using crypto for everyday purchases, like buying a coffee or a small item, can currently create complex tax reporting obligations for tiny gains. Frequent Small Trades: Active traders making many small profitable trades face a significant tracking burden. Tax Complexity: Many users find calculating and reporting capital gains tax on crypto confusing, especially for small amounts. By introducing this exemption, Ohio lawmakers hope to remove some of these hurdles, potentially encouraging greater use and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the state without creating unintended tax headaches for minor activities. What is the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act? The bill carrying this significant crypto tax exemption is formally known as the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. While the tax provision is a headline feature, the act‚Äôs name suggests it might encompass broader legislative efforts related to blockchain technology and digital assets within the state. Legislation labeled as ‚ÄòBasics Acts‚Äô often aims to establish foundational legal definitions, rights, and frameworks for emerging technologies. The passage of this act in the House with a strong 70-26 vote indicates significant bipartisan support for creating a more favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Ohio. It signals that state legislators are actively considering how to integrate these technologies into the existing legal and economic structure, starting with fundamental issues like taxation. While the full text of the bill likely covers more than just the tax exemption, this specific provision is the most immediately impactful for individual cryptocurrency users. It positions Ohio as one of the states exploring ways to adapt its tax code to the unique nature of digital assets and the potential for frequent, low-value transactions. How Does This Impact Cryptocurrency Tax Reporting for Ohio Residents? If this bill becomes law, it would directly affect how Ohio residents calculate and report their state-level capital gains tax related to crypto. Currently, any gain, no matter how small, is technically subject to tax and reporting requirements. The proposed exemption would create a specific carve-out. Consider these scenarios: Scenario A: You bought 0.01 ETH for $200. Later, you sell it for $210. Your gain is $10. Under the proposed law, this $10 gain would likely be exempt from Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario B: You bought 0.1 BTC for $3,000. Later, you sell it for $3,250. Your gain is $250. Since this gain is over the $200 threshold, the full $250 gain would still be subject to Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario C: You use 0.005 BTC (which you acquired for $100) to buy a $150 item. At the time of the transaction, that 0.005 BTC was worth $150. Your gain is $50 ($150 value received ‚Äì $100 cost basis). This $50 gain would likely be exempt. Important Note: This exemption, if enacted, would only apply to Ohio state capital gains tax. Federal capital gains tax rules, which currently do not have such a de minimis exemption for crypto, would still apply. Ohio residents would still need to track all transactions for federal reporting purposes. The primary benefit here is reducing the state-level tax liability and potentially simplifying state tax filings for those with only small crypto gains. However, the need for diligent record-keeping doesn‚Äôt disappear entirely, as users still need to determine if a gain exceeds the $200 threshold and track their cost basis for all transactions for federal tax purposes. The Road Ahead: Senate and Governor‚Äôs Desk Passing the House is a significant hurdle cleared, but the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act is not yet law. The bill must now make its way through the Ohio State Senate. The Senate will review the bill, potentially hold committee hearings, and may propose amendments before holding a vote. If the Senate passes the bill, it will then head to the desk of Governor Mike DeWine for his signature. The Governor has the power to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature after a certain period. Given the strong House vote, there is positive momentum, but passage in the Senate and approval by the Governor are still necessary steps. The legislative process can be complex, and the exact timeline is uncertain. Those interested in seeing this crypto tax exemption become law should follow its progress through the Senate. Why is This Crypto Tax Exemption Significant for Ohio? This move by the Ohio House is more than just a tax tweak; it‚Äôs a statement. It signals that Ohio is serious about understanding and potentially fostering the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries within its borders. By addressing one of the major pain points for crypto users ‚Äì the complexity of tax reporting on small gains ‚Äì the state aims to make engaging with digital assets less cumbersome. Potential benefits for Ohio include: Attracting Innovation: A clear and favorable regulatory environment, even on tax matters, can make Ohio more attractive to blockchain companies and developers. Encouraging Adoption: Reducing the tax burden on small transactions could encourage more residents and businesses to use crypto for payments or small investments. Setting a Precedent: Ohio could become an example for other states looking to modernize their tax laws for digital assets. While a $200 exemption might seem modest in the context of large crypto investments, it directly impacts the most frequent types of transactions and the broadest base of users who might be experimenting with or using crypto for minor purposes. It‚Äôs a practical step that addresses a real-world friction point. Potential Criticisms or Challenges Despite the positive reception from many in the crypto community, the bill isn‚Äôt without potential points of discussion or criticism: Limited Scope: The $200 gain threshold is relatively low compared to the potential value of larger crypto holdings. It primarily benefits those with small gains. Tracking Still Required: Users still need to track their cost basis and sale price for *all* transactions to determine if a gain occurred and whether it falls under the $200 threshold for state exemption. This doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for good record-keeping. Federal vs. State Discrepancy: Having different rules for state and federal tax can add another layer of complexity for taxpayers and tax professionals. These points highlight that while the bill is a step forward, the landscape of cryptocurrency tax remains complex, and users must stay informed and maintain meticulous records regardless of exemption thresholds. What Actionable Insights Should Ohio Residents Take? For cryptocurrency holders in Ohio, the most important takeaway right now is to stay informed. The bill has passed the House but is not yet law. Keep an eye on its progress through the Senate and towards the Governor‚Äôs office. Regardless of the bill‚Äôs final status, continue to practice diligent record-keeping for all your cryptocurrency transactions. This includes recording: The date of the transaction The type of cryptocurrency The number of units bought, sold, or traded The value of the transaction in U.S. dollars at the time Your cost basis (the price you paid for the crypto) The nature of the transaction (buy, sell, trade, spend) Using crypto tax software or maintaining a detailed spreadsheet can be invaluable. If the bill becomes law, you will need these records to identify which gains, if any, qualify for the state exemption. Conclusion: A Positive Step for Ohio Crypto Tax The passage of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act, including its crypto tax exemption for gains under $200, by the State House is a significant and positive development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Ohio. It demonstrates a legislative willingness to address practical challenges faced by individuals engaging with digital assets and positions the state as forward-thinking in its approach to blockchain technology. While the bill still has further steps to clear before becoming law, its progress reflects growing recognition among policymakers of the need to adapt tax regulations to the realities of the digital economy. This move could encourage greater participation in the crypto space within Ohio and potentially inspire similar legislative efforts in other states, contributing to a clearer and more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies nationwide.

Approximately $3.9 billion worth of options contracts will reach expiration on Deribit, the world‚Äôs leading crypto options exchange. $3.9 Billion in Crypto Options to Expire on Deribit as Investors Turn Bullish on Ethereum This event is expected to cause significant volatility in both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets. Of the total, $3.3 billion is made up of the notional value of Bitcoin options. The Put/Call ratio is at 1.16, indicating a slight downtrend as traders hold more put options than calls. However, the maximum pain point is set at $106,000, which is the price at which the option will become worthless, suggesting a relatively neutral positioning. Market data suggests that BTC options are clustered around this level, suggesting a balanced outlook from investors ahead of expiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum options total $546 million and the Put/Call ratio is just 0.68, a clear sign of bullish sentiment among traders. The maximum pain price for ETH is $2,600, but option activity is weighted towards call positions, indicating strong expectations for an upward price movement. The concept of maximum pain, where the most options expire worthless, is often cited as a short-term price magnet during expiration events. As such, current levels of $106,000 for BTC and $2,600 for ETH could act as centers of attraction in the hours leading up to expiration. While Bitcoin's market positioning appears cautious, Ethereum's bullish momentum could lead to increased volatility and potential upside moves, especially if the overall market sentiment remains positive.

Most tokens have held their crucial price levels as Bitcoin trades range-bound within the $105,000 vicinity. Altcoins saw mixed movements in the last 24 hours, with many signaling potential momentum shifts to bullish. Ethereum holds above its key support of $2,500, while Raydium and Mantle stole the show with substantial gains over the past day. Ethereum holds $2,500 amid institutional inflows The largest altcoin by market cap has remained resilient as the crypto industry ignored the Israel-Iran conflict.

SoSoValue data shows US ETH spot exchange-traded funds have seen a single red day in the past ten days. Source ‚Äì SoSoValue Maintaining the prevailing bullishness could see the token soaring to the nearest resistance at $2,699. Bulls should push Ethereum above this level to shift its short-term outlook to bullish. Nevertheless, losing grounds at $2,500 would trigger notable dips to the reliable support zone at $2,395. Weakness at this foothold might open the path to the psychological mark of $2,000. RAY skyrockets on Upbit listing Raydium dominated crypto trends on Thursday following its sharp jump to an intraday high of $2.6279. It has gained approximately 35% since yesterday. RAY was trading at $2.22 after brief corrections from its daily peak. Chart by Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by over 600%, indicating renewed trader interest in the altcoin. The bullish momentum emerged after South Korea‚Äôs leading exchange, Upbit, confirmed listing Raydium‚Äôs USDT and KRW trading pairs. However, the question remains. Can Raydium sustain the prevailing rally and switch it to long-term gains? The token exhibits massive volatility, calling for caution. Further, the latest rebound comes after an extended struggle, with RAY lowering about 30% of its value the previous month. While it can stretch its current upside, the alt remains poised for notable declines once the ‚ÄúUpbit optimism‚Äù diminishes. However, reclaiming the vital region between $2.60 and $2.70 could trigger substantial gains to the resistance at $3.5.

2025-06-19T15:30:49,"Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern ‚Äì $4,000 Is The Trigger Point","Ethereum is trading within a tight range that has held for several weeks, forming the kind of compression structure that often leads to a significant breakout. Despite heightened volatility in global markets driven by escalating tensions in the Middle East, ETH has remained resilient, holding strong above key demand zones around the $2,500‚Äì$2,600 area. The current environment is marked by uncertainty, with geopolitical conflict and macroeconomic risks weighing on investor sentiment. Yet Ethereum‚Äôs price structure suggests that bulls are patiently building momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low ‚Äì No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook, pointing out that Ethereum is mirroring the same consolidation pattern that Bitcoin followed during its 2017‚Äì2021 cycle. In that historical setup, BTC compressed into a tight range before entering a parabolic rally once the upper boundary was broken. If Ethereum follows a similar path, the next move could be dramatic, especially if it clears major resistance levels like $2,800. As long as ETH holds range support and absorbs both upside and downside wicks, this setup remains intact. A breakout above the current range could ignite a fresh leg up for Ethereum‚Äîand possibly spark renewed strength across the altcoin market. Ethereum Builds Momentum As Market Awaits Clarity Ethereum is currently trading in a tight range, consolidating just above the $2,600 level and holding firm despite macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. After rallying nearly 80% from its April lows, ETH appears to be preparing for a decisive move in the coming sessions. However, with escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and uncertainty surrounding possible U.S. involvement, broader markets remain cautious. Until clarity emerges on the geopolitical front, sideways price action may persist. Still, Ethereum‚Äôs price structure remains constructive. Strong consolidation above key demand zones reflects ongoing buyer interest and a lack of heavy selling pressure. This behavior often precedes major moves, as investors accumulate ahead of expected volatility. Some market participants remain cautious, warning of a possible retrace below the $2,400 level if demand falters or broader risk sentiment weakens. In contrast, bullish analysts like Ted Pillows suggest a more optimistic outlook. According to Pillows, Ethereum is closely following the path Bitcoin took during its 2017‚Äì2021 cycle, where tight consolidation ultimately led to a breakout and parabolic rally. In this view, ETH‚Äôs real explosive phase won‚Äôt begin until it breaks above $4,000. If this scenario plays out, Ethereum could trigger a broader altcoin surge and shift overall crypto market sentiment bullish once again.

This area also coincides with the 200-day SMA (red line), which continues to cap upward momentum.

2025-06-19T15:21:57,"Only 30% of Russian crypto miners registered, says finance ministry","Most of the crypto miners in Russia don‚Äôt comply with the regulations the country imposed on mining. Russia is taking steps to legalize and regulate crypto mining to bring it out of the informal economy. Still, most crypto miners in the country fall outside relevant regulation, authorities say. On Tuesday, June 19, the Finance Ministry revealed that just 30% of miners are registered with the relevant tax authorities. According to Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov, registering crypto mining entities is still an ongoing process. The authorities aim to bring miners into the regulated economy, where they can be taxed and managed. ‚ÄúOur general approach, when we introduced regulation of mining in this industry, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible. We have not yet completed this process. So far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the Federal Tax Service, and this process is still far from complete. Another 2/3 need to be ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù and entered into the register. Therefore, we will work to complete this process,‚Äù Chebeskov said. Still, taxation is not the only reason for registration. Starting in 2025, Russia has banned crypto mining in certain regions with weaker infrastructure, especially during peak hours. The goal is to reduce the strain on electrical grids.

In 2024, the country imposed a 15% tax on cryptocurrency mining profits, based on market value when received. However, it also lifted some taxes, including VAT on crypto purchases. For Russian citizens and businesses, Bitcoin (BTC) mining remains a profitable way to leverage the country‚Äôs cheap energy prices.

Here is the Latest Data","Institutional interest in U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues. Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong investor interest, recording net inflows of $2.4 billion for the eighth day in a row. Wednesday alone saw inflows of $389.5 million. $2.4 Billion Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 8 Days: Signals of a Slowdown in Ethereum ETFs BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT fund led the way with net inflows of $278.9 million on Wednesday alone, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC fund raised $104.4 million on the same day. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, Grayscale‚Äôs BTC Mini, and Hashdex‚Äôs DEFI funds saw inflows of $11.3 million, $10.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, while Grayscale‚Äôs high-fee GBTC fund stood out with a single net outflow of $16.4 million. In the 8-day period, 96% of total inflows were made to the IBIT fund, which attracted $2.3 billion in investments during this time. The ETF Store President Nate Geraci emphasized institutional interest by saying, ‚ÄúThere has been $11.5 billion inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs so far in 2025. This is the second year. Still no demand?‚Äù in a statement on social media platform X. There have been a total of $46.9 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their January 2024 debut, and these funds currently manage approximately $125 billion in assets. On the Ethereum side, there is a calmer picture. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $19.1 million on Wednesday. $15.1 million of this inflow was made to BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA fund. The slowdown in flows is notable after the 19-day record inflow streak of $1.4 billion for Ethereum ETFs that ended last week. Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of more than $3.8 billion in the same 19-day period. Total net inflows for Ethereum ETFs currently sit at $3.9 billion. BRN Research Analyst Valentin Fournier commented on the slowdown in institutional interest in Ethereum: ‚ÄúData suggests institutions maintain a bullish medium-term perspective on crypto, but the catch-up phase in Ethereum appears to be over.‚Äù Macro Uncertainties Pressure Market Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,810, down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and 2.5% in the last week, while Ethereum is down 8.3% to $2,527 in the same period. The FOMC was expected to keep interest rates unchanged, but the statement took a more hawkish tone. ‚ÄúBitcoin is holding above $100,000 but has failed to break resistance levels. A retest of $102,000 support looks likely,‚Äù Fournier said. The Long-Term Investment Story is Getting Stronger 21Shares Crypto Investments Expert David Hernandez drew a more optimistic picture: ‚ÄúAs confidence in soft landings wanes and global financial imbalances rise, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality make it an increasingly attractive asset for investors grappling with uncertainty.‚Äù ‚ÄúBitcoin has established a permanent foothold above the $100,000 level.

2025-06-19T15:05:18,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Nears Inflection Point, What‚Äôs Next?","XRP continues to trade within a tight consolidation range while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate recent market headlines. Despite lacking strong bullish momentum, XRP‚Äôs price action shows resilience, holding key support zones across both USDT and BTC pairs. However, both charts suggest that the asset is nearing critical inflection points, where a breakdown or breakout could define the next major move. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRP/USDT remains compressed within a long-term descending channel pattern, bounded by a descending trendline from the yearly highs and a horizontal support near $1.95, with tons of sell-side liquidity resting under it. The pair is currently trading around $2.15, just under both the 100 and 200 moving averages. The RSI is also hovering near 44, indicating the lack of momentum and confirming the range-bound behavior. The asset is currently coiling just above the highlighted liquidity level, suggesting that if sellers manage to breach $1.95, the next logical demand zone lies around $1.6. Meanwhile, upside resistance remains at the upper bound of the channel near $2.60, which has rejected multiple attempts in recent weeks. A clean break and daily close above that trendline would potentially confirm a bullish rally, with the target being around $3. Until then, this is still a neutral structure favoring range traders rather than trend-followers. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP has shown persistent weakness since March, consistently printing lower highs and lower lows. The chart highlights a large descending wedge formation, with price now moving toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Both the 100 and 200 moving averages are angled downward after a bearish crossover, and the RSI is still depressed near 42, reflecting ongoing relative underperformance. That said, the pair is approaching the imbalance zone (FVG) left from the explosive rally in late 2024. This pocket, located just below 1900 SAT, could act as a magnet for price while also offering potential for a relief bounce. If the buyers step in, the first challenge lies near the higher trendline of the wedge around 2200 SAT, which coincides with a horizontal resistance level. A decisive move above that level could shift short-term momentum, but unless that happens, the pair remains locked in a clear bearish structure.

2025-06-19T15:00:00,"Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Tax Preparation","In today‚Äôs Crypto for Advisors, Bryan Courchesne from DAIM provides information on tax planning for crypto trades. Although we are half a year away from tax season, there are many considerations to track in order to be tax-ready. Then, Saim Akif from Akif CPA breaks down the differences in tax treatment between crypto and equities/bonds in Ask an Expert. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Crypto Taxes Are Complicated, Don‚Äôt Let Them Derail Your Portfolio As advisors focused on crypto, we‚Äôre familiar with the unique tax situations this asset class presents. For example, crypto is not subject to wash-sale rules, which allows for more efficient tax-loss harvesting. It also enables direct asset swaps, such as converting bitcoin (BTC) to ether (ETH) or ETH to Solana (SOL), without first selling into cash. These are just a couple of features that set crypto apart from traditional investments. However, perhaps the most important thing for investors to consider is the sheer number of platforms they may use and how challenging it can be to track everything at tax time. Tracking your crypto taxes isn‚Äôt just a year-end chore; it‚Äôs a year-round challenge, especially if you‚Äôre active on multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs) or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Every trade, swap, airdrop, staking reward, or bridging event can be a taxable event. Centralized Exchange Trading When using CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you may receive year-end tax summaries, but those are often incomplete or inconsistent across platforms. One major challenge is tracking your cost basis across exchanges. For example, if you buy Amazon stock in a Fidelity account and transfer it to Schwab, your cost basis transfers seamlessly and updates with each new trade. At tax time, Schwab can generate an accurate 1099 showing your gains and losses. But in crypto, if you transfer assets from Kraken to Coinbase, your cost basis doesn‚Äôt automatically transfer with them. If you‚Äôre moving assets across multiple platforms, you‚Äôll need to manually track every transaction, or you‚Äôll face a major headache when filing taxes. Decentralized Exchange Trading Things get even more complicated when using DEXs. Apps like Coinbase Wallet (not to be confused with the Coinbase exchange) or Phantom connect you to decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter. These DEXs don‚Äôt issue tax forms or track your cost basis, so it‚Äôs entirely up to you to log and reconcile every transaction. Miss a single token swap or forget to record the fair market value of a liquidity pool withdrawal, and your tax report could be inaccurate. That could trigger IRS scrutiny or lead to missed deductions. While some apps can calculate gains and losses from a single wallet address, they often struggle when assets are transferred between addresses, making them less useful for active users. And here‚Äôs the kicker: if you‚Äôre actively trading on DEXs, chances are you‚Äôre not even making money. But even losses must be reported correctly to qualify for a deduction. If not, you risk losing the write-off or, worse, facing an audit. Unless you‚Äôre a full-time crypto trader, the time and effort required to track every transaction isn‚Äôt just stressful, it can cost you real money. What steps can I take to make sure I'm tax ready? There are, however, several ways to prepare properly for crypto taxes: Use crypto tax software from the beginning. Even then, you‚Äôll want to double-check that the reported activity makes sense and adjust as needed. Hire a crypto tax specialist or work with a crypto-focused advisor who understands the landscape. Download all transaction logs and see if your CPA or advisor can help build a cost basis and determine your realized gains and losses. As adoption increases, tax reporting will undoubtedly evolve ‚Äî in the meantime keeping track of your trade activity is important to be ready for tax season. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. Why are advisors watching crypto closely? A. Institutional crypto inflows have surged to $35 billion . While crypto is more volatile than traditional assets, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have historically outperformed other traditional asset classes since 2012. Q. How is crypto being treated differently from equities/bonds from a tax side? A. Crypto differs fundamentally from equities and bonds. Advisors must track each wallet separately for cost basis (starting Jan 2025). Unlike traditional 1099s, clients often get little to no reporting support from exchanges, especially for self-custodied assets. Q. Do you have any special insights for CPAs and tax advisors? A. Compliance isn‚Äôt optional anymore. Starting with 2025 returns: Wallet-level cost basis reporting is mandatory. IRS Form 1099-DA will begin showing up in 2026. Exchanges often don‚Äôt support reporting for self-custodied assets. Smart tax professionals are combining tax reporting, audit defence, and DeFi accounting into premium advisory services. - Saim Akif, founder, Akif CPA Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading Spanish banking giant BBVA tells wealthy clients to invest 3 to 7% of their portfolio in bitcoin .

That‚Äôs the latest update from Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, who said the company is building out full financial tools for users to control everything from payments to investing. The comments came during an interview with the Financial Times at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, where she explained how this new plan fits into Elon‚Äôs larger plan to turn X into an ‚Äúeverything app.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be able to come to X and be able to transact your whole financial life on the platform,‚Äù Linda said, speaking directly about the new investment features. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs whether I can pay you for the pizza that we shared last night or make an investment or a trade. So that‚Äôs the future.‚Äù This expansion will allow people to pay for goods, tip creators, and make trades on the same platform they already use for content. X plans US rollout of X Money and financial tools X is rolling out its financial services in stages. First up is X Money, a new digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment system that will launch in the United States before expanding to other countries. Linda said X Money will support functions like tipping, saving, and buying things directly in the app. X is also partnering with Visa to back the payment system and plans to add an X-branded credit or debit card as early as this year. Elon bought the company, then called Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. Since then, he‚Äôs tried to turn it into a catch-all platform modeled after WeChat, the Chinese app that blends messaging, social media, shopping, and finance. Linda said this new expansion isn‚Äôt just about payments. She said: ‚ÄúA whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem is going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today.‚Äù But adding financial tools means X has to face regulatory challenges. Services like stock trading, crypto transfers, and payments come with licensing issues, money laundering laws, and compliance requirements that are far stricter than anything the company has dealt with before. That hasn‚Äôt stopped Elon from pushing forward. At the same time, X is still trying to fix its ad revenue problem. After Elon‚Äôs takeover, most of the platform‚Äôs advertisers pulled out, saying they didn‚Äôt want their brands next to toxic content or political chaos. Revenue dropped from $4.1 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion last year, but research firm Emarketer projects it might climb to $2.3 billion in 2025. X battles with advertisers while pushing AI tie-in X has also been accused of pressuring brands to come back. The Wall Street Journal reported that companies like Verizon and Ralph Lauren agreed to buy ads after allegedly being threatened with legal action. Linda denied that and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unnamed sources, random third-party commenters.‚Äù She called the claims ‚Äúhearsay‚Äù and said X never forced anyone to spend money. To make matters worse, some advertisers at Cannes said they‚Äôre still not confident in the platform. One person claimed they were told they had to hit a spending threshold or face a lawsuit. Another said Elon‚Äôs close ties with President Donald Trump made them uneasy about saying no to ad deals. X is already suing the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, a group of brands and ad agencies, for organizing what it says was an illegal boycott under the pretense of ‚Äúonline safety.‚Äù That lawsuit, filed last summer, accuses them of breaking competition laws. Since then, the company has removed and added brands from the complaint. It dropped Unilever after the company started buying ads again in October. Still, Linda told advertisers that 96% of pre-acquisition clients are now back. She claimed X is close to recovering its full ad business from 2022. But the people on the ground aren‚Äôt fully convinced. Some said they still think the platform is too unpredictable. Others think the content‚Äôs still too toxic.

Prominent cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL), have struggled to build momentum in recent weeks as market sentiment turns bearish. The price jump is part of Husky Inu‚Äôs HINU) pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date draws closer. It is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a dynamic pricing strategy, allowing the project to increase the token price every two days. The phase will end once the project meets its fundraising goal or the HINU tokens sell out. Fundraising Milestone Husky Inu (HINU) adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise funds more effectively. The pricing strategy allows the project to raise the price of the HINU token every two days, enabling it to raise funds while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project‚Äôs growing community. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. Husky Inu has raised $806,468 so far and is setting its sights on the $850,000 milestone.
