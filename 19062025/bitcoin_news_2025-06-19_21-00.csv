2025-06-19T18:49:11,"Top 3 Projects Dominating Headlines as a New Wave of Political and Corporate Adoption Builds","A new surge of interest in the crypto space is being driven by major shifts in political and corporate spheres. Key projects are emerging as frontrunners, capturing headlines and attracting attention. This article reveals the top three contenders poised for significant growth, offering a glimpse into the future of digital currency adoption. Bitcoin Price Update: Range-Bound Trading with Mixed Trends Bitcoin experienced a slight decline of 4.33% over the past week and a near-flat performance with a drop of 0.94% in the last month, while showing a half-year gain of 7.92%. This short-term pullback contrasts with the overall positive momentum observed in recent months, indicating that selling pressure has not fully erased longer-term gains. Modest fluctuations have characterized recent price action, with minor dips amidst the overall recovery. The numbers reflect a resilient coin, as investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic despite brief setbacks. Bitcoin currently trades within a range between $94,832 and $113,326.80. Immediate support is at $84,880, while resistance is near $121,869.42. Additional support is found at $66,385 and resistance at $140,364. The Awesome Oscillator at -681.90 and Momentum Indicator at -321.30 show a lack of strong bullish momentum, while the RSI at 49.84 indicates a balance between bulls and bears. With no clear trend, traders may look for a breakout above $121,869.42 for bullish opportunities or consider shorting if prices fall below $84,880. Monitoring these levels is essential for timely trading decisions. SOL Price Analysis: Evaluating Trends and Key Levels Solana experienced a decline over the past month with a 14.03% drop and a six-month decrease of 23.16%, while the one-week change reached -9.63%. The trading range stood between $136 and $182, reflecting notable price variability. The coin’s performance indicates a period of downward movement combined with fluctuation in momentum. Solana’s price behavior has shown clear signs of pressure, as seen in the significant percentage changes that signal reduced buying power and an overall bearish sentiment. The current price scenario shows Solana trading between $136 and $182, with immediate resistance at $207.9 and support at $115.84. A secondary resistance is at $253.93, while secondary support is at $69.81. Technical indicators reveal an Awesome Oscillator of -11.948, a Momentum Indicator of -3.38, and an RSI of 43.84, suggesting bears have the upper hand. The market does not signal a clear long-term trend, leaving room for strategic trades as bullish forces attempt to reverse the current downturn. XRP Faces Downtrend with Key Support and Resistance Levels Over the last month, XRP has experienced a significant decline of about 10.6%, while its half-year performance shows a milder drop of approximately 3.0%. Price action fluctuated within a range of $1.95 to $2.53. A one-week decrease close to 5.8% underlined short-term bearish momentum. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator reported negative values, reflecting a lack of buying interest. The relative strength index stayed just below 46, suggesting a slight caution in market activity. These indicators point to a sustained consolidation phase in recent weeks. Currently, XRP is trading under mild pressure. Immediate support is near $1.73, while resistance is noted around $2.88, with a significant upper barrier at $3.45 and lower support at approximately $1.15. Bearish signals dominate from moving averages and oscillators, indicating stronger bear influence. There is no clear upward trend, as prices remain confined within these levels. Traders may consider buying near support for potential rebounds or selling near resistance to secure short-term gains. Monitoring momentum changes around these levels will be crucial for strategic entries and exits. Conclusion BTC , SOL , and XRP are at the forefront as political and corporate interest grows. Each offers unique advantages that attract attention. BTC remains a solid choice for mainstream acceptance. SOL impresses with its rapid transactions and low costs. XRP stands out due to partnerships with financial institutions. This trio is setting new benchmarks in the evolving crypto arena. Attractive features and rising adoption signal a promising future.

2025-06-19T18:45:36,"Top Chinese Bitcoin Mining Companies To Set Up Shop in US To Avoid President Trump’s Tariffs: Report","The three best-selling makers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining machines in the world are reportedly setting up their manufacturing hubs in the US. Reuters reports that Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, the Chinese firms behind over 90% of the global mining rigs that produce Bitcoin, are establishing their US bases to avoid the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Bitmain, the largest of the three by sales, started producing US mining rigs in December as a strategic move following Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. Canaan began its trial production in the US following the announcement of the so-called Liberation Day levies as an exploratory initiative to avoid import duties. The third-ranked MicroBT says it is actively implementing a localization strategy to avoid the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, the US-based Bitcoin mining startup Auradine is pushing to restrict Chinese hardware supplies to boost competition. The firm’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, says that while over 30% of Bitcoin mining takes place in North America, more than 90% of the mining hardware comes from China, which represents a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply. Gupta says thousands of Chinese mining rigs are also connected to the US electrical grids, which he says poses a security risk, but Canaan senior executive Leo Wang says the mining rigs do not threaten security because they are useless if not applied to Bitcoin mining.

2025-06-19T18:40:04,"Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study The intersection of energy policy and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency mining is a hot topic globally. In France, a recent development has put a spotlight on this complex relationship, specifically concerning the potential use of the nation’s surplus energy. However, the path forward for exploring this idea seems to have hit a roadblock, at least for now. What Happened with French Energy Policy and Bitcoin Mining? Recent reports from Bitcoin.com News highlight a significant decision made by the French National Assembly. Lawmakers there chose not to move forward with a proposal that would have initiated a study into whether Bitcoin mining could serve as an outlet for the country’s excess energy. This wasn’t a vote on actually *using* energy for mining, but merely on whether to conduct a feasibility study. The proposed amendment, which aimed simply to explore the concept, was reportedly dismissed on procedural grounds. This means the idea didn’t even get a full debate on its potential merits or drawbacks within the assembly. The decision effectively shut down the immediate possibility of a formal governmental exploration into this specific use case for surplus energy. This development is particularly noteworthy given France’s unique energy landscape, which is heavily reliant on nuclear power, providing a stable base load that can sometimes lead to periods of excess generation, especially during low demand periods or when renewable sources are producing strongly. Why Consider Bitcoin Mining for Excess Energy? The idea of using excess energy for Bitcoin mining isn’t new globally. It stems from the fundamental nature of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires significant computational power and, consequently, energy. While often criticized for its energy consumption, proponents argue that directing energy that would otherwise be wasted or curtailed towards a productive economic activity like mining offers several potential benefits: Monetizing Waste: Energy grids sometimes produce more power than is immediately needed, particularly from inflexible sources like nuclear or intermittent renewables during peak generation times and low demand. This excess energy can be difficult or costly to store or transmit. Bitcoin mining provides a flexible, interruptible load that can consume this energy, turning a potential liability (wasted energy) into an asset (mined Bitcoin). Grid Stability: Mining operations can potentially act as a form of demand response. They can be powered up quickly when excess energy is available and powered down when the grid needs that power elsewhere, helping to balance supply and demand. This is particularly relevant for managing the variability introduced by growing sources of renewable energy. Funding Renewable Projects: In regions with significant renewable energy production (like hydro, solar, or wind), excess generation is sometimes curtailed (shut down) because the grid cannot absorb it all. Co-locating Bitcoin mining facilities with these projects allows the excess renewable energy to be used on-site, improving the economics of the renewable project and potentially incentivizing further development of sustainable energy infrastructure. Economic Opportunity: Utilizing domestically produced excess energy for mining keeps the economic value generated (the mined Bitcoin) within the country, potentially creating jobs and tax revenue. Decentralized Infrastructure: Bitcoin mining contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network, which some view as a strategic advantage. The amendment proposed in France aimed to study these possibilities, exploring the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility within the specific context of the French grid and its energy mix. The procedural dismissal means these potential benefits, at least from a governmental perspective, remain unexamined. What Are the Concerns and Why the Dismissal? While the amendment was dismissed procedurally, preventing a full debate on the merits, there are underlying concerns often raised about Bitcoin mining that likely contribute to such hesitations and regulatory stances, including aspects related to cryptocurrency regulation France might consider in the future. Potential reasons for the resistance or underlying concerns could include: Public Perception and Environmental Concerns: Despite the focus on *excess* energy, Bitcoin mining still carries a public image of being energy-intensive. Lawmakers might be wary of associating a national energy strategy, even for surplus power, with an activity perceived by some as environmentally damaging. Understanding the Technology: The complexities of Bitcoin mining and its potential integration with grid management might not be fully understood by all policymakers, leading to caution or skepticism. Focus on Other Priorities: French energy policy has numerous pressing challenges, including maintaining nuclear infrastructure, developing renewables, ensuring energy security, and managing energy costs for citizens. Exploring a novel use case like Bitcoin mining for excess energy might be seen as a low priority compared to these more traditional concerns. Procedural Hurdles: The specific reason for the procedural dismissal isn’t detailed in the source, but it could relate to how the amendment was drafted, its timing, or its relevance to the specific bill it was attached to. Sometimes, good ideas get sidelined due to parliamentary procedures rather than outright opposition to the concept itself. Regulatory Uncertainty: The broader landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in France and the EU is still evolving. Integrating a decentralized, global activity like Bitcoin mining into national energy infrastructure might raise complex regulatory questions that lawmakers are not yet prepared to address. The lack of a formal study means these concerns, as well as the potential benefits, were not publicly debated or analyzed by the National Assembly. This leaves the door open for continued speculation and debate outside of the official governmental process. French Energy Policy Context: A Quick Look To understand the context of this decision, it’s important to touch upon the specifics of French energy policy. France has historically relied heavily on nuclear power, which provides a large, stable baseload of electricity. This is complemented by hydroelectric power, and increasingly, by solar and wind energy. The nature of nuclear power means it’s not easily ramped up or down in response to short-term demand fluctuations. This can lead to situations where generation exceeds demand, particularly during off-peak hours or mild weather. Furthermore, the growth of intermittent renewables like solar and wind can also create periods of surplus energy generation, especially when windy or sunny conditions coincide with low demand. Managing this variability and utilizing or storing this excess energy efficiently is a key challenge for grid operators everywhere, including France. The amendment likely sought to investigate if Bitcoin mining could be a part of the solution for managing these specific types of surplus energy situations, acting as a flexible load that could be curtailed when the energy is needed elsewhere or when prices rise. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Regulation in France? While this specific decision was about energy use and not direct cryptocurrency regulation France, it reflects a cautious approach by lawmakers towards integrating novel crypto-related activities into established national infrastructure and policy areas. The procedural dismissal suggests either a lack of political will to delve into the topic at this time, or perhaps indicates that the legislative path chosen for the amendment was not the appropriate one. It doesn’t necessarily signal outright hostility towards Bitcoin or crypto, but rather a reluctance to formally explore its potential role in a critical sector like energy without, perhaps, more public pressure, better understanding, or a different political climate. Future discussions around cryptocurrency regulation in France might still touch upon the energy footprint of crypto activities, but this specific avenue for potentially utilizing surplus power has been put on hold. Sustainable Energy and Bitcoin: An Ongoing Debate The debate around Bitcoin’s energy consumption and its relationship with sustainable energy sources is far from settled. Proponents argue that Bitcoin mining can actually *support* the development of renewable energy by providing a ready buyer for otherwise curtailed or stranded power. Critics remain concerned about the overall scale of energy use and the potential for mining to incentivize the use of fossil fuels in other contexts. The French proposal to study using excess energy fits squarely into this debate. It represents an attempt to explore a pathway where Bitcoin mining could be aligned with energy efficiency and sustainability goals, by consuming energy that would otherwise go to waste. The rejection of this study means France is not currently exploring this specific alignment at a governmental level, leaving potential opportunities on the table according to proponents, or avoiding a potentially controversial association according to critics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next? The procedural dismissal of the amendment doesn’t mean the conversation is over. The topic of energy use by cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin mining, is likely to remain a subject of discussion in policy circles, especially as France and the EU continue to grapple with energy security, climate goals, and digital innovation. Future developments could include: Industry-Led Initiatives: The private sector in France might still explore opportunities to use excess energy for mining, perhaps through direct agreements with energy producers or grid operators, independent of governmental studies. Renewed Legislative Efforts: Proponents of the idea could attempt to introduce similar proposals again in the future, perhaps with different phrasing, timing, or attached to different legislation. Broader EU Discussions: Energy and cryptocurrency regulation are often discussed at the EU level. Developments in other member states or directives from Brussels could influence France’s approach. Increased Public and Political Education: A clearer understanding of how Bitcoin mining can be used for grid balancing or consuming otherwise wasted energy might shift perspectives over time. For now, the formal exploration of using France’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is paused, a result of procedural hurdles rather than a deep dive into the potential benefits and challenges. Summary: A Missed Opportunity for Study? The decision by the French National Assembly to dismiss an amendment proposing a study on using the nation’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is a notable event in the ongoing global discussion about cryptocurrency’s energy footprint and its potential integration with energy grids. While the dismissal was procedural, it effectively halts official exploration into a concept that proponents argue could offer significant benefits for French energy policy, grid stability, and the monetization of otherwise wasted power. The lack of a formal study leaves the potential advantages, as well as the legitimate concerns regarding environmental perception and technical integration, undiscussed at the governmental level. As France navigates its energy future and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation France, the question of how best to utilize its excess energy, and whether activities like Bitcoin mining could play a role in promoting sustainable energy goals, remains a fascinating and relevant topic for future consideration.

2025-06-19T18:31:56,"Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity","BitcoinWorld Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for a bold forecast that’s making waves across the crypto market . Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, recently shared a truly ambitious vision for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. What’s the Big Prediction from Arthur Hayes? In a candid interview, Arthur Hayes laid out his case for a staggering potential target for Bitcoin. He didn’t just suggest a modest increase; he’s looking at a monumental surge. According to Hayes, the Bitcoin price prediction could see BTC soaring to heights previously thought unimaginable by many. Specifically, Hayes believes Bitcoin could hit: $250,000 by the end of the current year (representing a significant gain from recent levels). A jaw-dropping $1,000,000 (or $1M) by the year 2028 . This isn’t just a random guess; Hayes ties this incredible forecast to specific macroeconomic factors he believes will play out over the coming years. How Does Fed Liquidity Fuel This Massive BTC Price? The core of Hayes’ argument revolves around the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve. He anticipates a colossal injection of liquidity into the U.S. economy. Here’s the breakdown of his reasoning: Massive Liquidity Injection: Hayes projects that the Federal Reserve will inject approximately $9 trillion in liquidity into the U.S. economy by 2028. Think of this as a significant increase in the money supply or available credit within the system. Flow into Traditional Finance First: This vast pool of liquidity doesn’t immediately rush into crypto. Hayes suggests it will first flow into traditional economic sectors and financial markets. This includes areas like manufacturing and other parts of the ‘real economy’. Spillover into Risk Assets: As this liquidity permeates the traditional system, it eventually seeks higher returns. This leads to capital flowing into ‘risk assets’. What are risk assets? They are investments like stocks, commodities, and yes, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have the potential for higher returns but also higher volatility compared to safer investments like government bonds. Bitcoin as a Prime Beneficiary: Given its nature as a scarce digital asset often seen as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, Bitcoin is positioned, in Hayes’ view, to be a major beneficiary of this liquidity spillover. What About Easing Bank Regulations? Arthur Hayes also pointed to another factor accelerating this process: changes in banking regulations. He noted that easing capital requirements for banks holding U.S. Treasuries is significant. How does this help Bitcoin? Freed-Up Lending Capacity: By requiring banks to hold less capital against their Treasury holdings, it effectively frees up capital that banks can use for lending. Credit Expansion: This increased capacity can drive an expansion of credit throughout the economy. More Fuel for the Fire: This expansion of credit adds another layer of liquidity and capital seeking returns, further contributing to the potential flow into risk assets and ultimately boosting the BTC price . It’s a complex interplay of monetary policy and banking regulations that Hayes believes creates a fertile ground for substantial asset price appreciation, with Bitcoin being a prime candidate for explosive growth. Is a $1M Bitcoin Price Realistic by 2028? Hayes’ prediction is undoubtedly bold and sits at the higher end of many long-term forecasts. While the mechanism he describes – liquidity flowing into risk assets – is a recognized economic principle, the exact scale and timeline are subject to debate. Investors should consider: Macroeconomic conditions can change rapidly. Regulatory environments for crypto are still evolving globally. Bitcoin’s own adoption rate and technological developments will play a role. However, coming from a figure like Arthur Hayes , whose insights often stem from a deep understanding of market structure and global finance, the prediction warrants attention and highlights the potential upside many see for Bitcoin in a world of expanding fiat currency supply. Concluding Thoughts on the $1M BTC Price Target Arthur Hayes’ forecast of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2028, driven by anticipated Federal Reserve liquidity and easing bank regulations, paints an incredibly bullish picture for the future of the crypto market . While ambitious, his rationale provides a clear framework rooted in macroeconomic forces. Whether BTC reaches this specific target or not, the prediction underscores the significant potential many experts see for Bitcoin as global liquidity expands. It serves as a powerful reminder of the long-term upside potential that attracts investors to the digital asset space.

2025-06-19T18:30:09,"Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent","Ethereum is currently facing a pivotal moment as it continues to consolidate below the $3,000 level. Bulls are targeting a breakout above this key resistance zone, which could trigger a major upward move. However, broader market conditions remain fragile. Geopolitical tensions—particularly the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran—continue to create a high-risk macroeconomic environment, leading to increased volatility and intermittent selling pressure across risk assets. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% Despite these challenges, ETH has shown resilience by holding above the $2,500 support zone. The price has remained locked in a narrow trading range for weeks, reflecting market indecision and caution among participants. According to a technical analysis shared by top analyst Daan, Ethereum continues to trade within this very tight range, with price wicks on both sides consistently getting absorbed. This type of price action signals growing compression, often a precursor to a strong directional move once one side gives in. Traders are now closely monitoring the structure for a higher timeframe close above $2,800, which could validate bullish momentum and open the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, the market appears balanced, and any shift in geopolitical developments may quickly tilt sentiment in either direction. Ethereum Prepares For Breakout as Market Awaits Confirmation Ethereum remains over 60% below its 2024 high of $4,100, but the asset is showing signs of recovery after months of downward pressure and indecision. Bulls have struggled to regain control throughout the year, but recent price action indicates the start of a potential rally. This recovery, however, remains tentative and will require confirmation through a higher timeframe close above critical resistance levels, particularly the $2,800–$3,000 range. The broader environment continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty—including rising U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about inflation—are creating headwinds for risk assets, Ethereum included. Despite this, ETH has managed to hold key support above the $2,500 level, a sign that bulls are defending their ground. According to technical analysis shared by analyst Daan, Ethereum is currently trading within a very tight range, with price wicks on both sides being consistently absorbed. This type of compression typically signals an incoming surge in volatility. Daan notes that once one side gives in, the resulting move often becomes explosive and sustained. The current range-bound action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but that balance won’t last forever. Traders are watching closely for a decisive higher timeframe close above resistance—or below support—as confirmation of the next trend direction. With ETH positioned near major technical zones, a breakout could lead to significant momentum, potentially bringing Ethereum closer to reclaiming the psychological $3,000 mark and reigniting a push toward cycle highs. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Ethereum Continues Range-Bound Trading As Key Support Holds Ethereum (ETH) remains locked in a tight range between approximately $2,500 and $2,800, showing little directional clarity over the past several weeks. The chart above (12-hour timeframe) reflects persistent consolidation with multiple wicks on both ends of the candles, indicating absorption of both bullish and bearish momentum. This suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have taken firm control. ETH currently trades near $2,540 and is holding above the 100-period simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as short-term support. The 50 SMA has flattened, further reinforcing the sideways nature of the price action. Volume has also tapered off, typical in compression phases that often precede strong breakouts or breakdowns. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,675–$2,800 resistance zone, the 200 SMA near $2,117 may become relevant as a deeper support target. However, as long as ETH maintains price action above $2,500, bulls are still in play. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack The structure suggests that Ethereum is building energy for a decisive move. A higher timeframe close above $2,800 could trigger a new leg up toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a break below $2,500 could lead to renewed bearish pressure. For now, traders are watching for breakout confirmation.

2025-06-19T18:13:23,"Binance price outlook: Can BNB break out of the $400–$800 range?","Binance continues to trade sideways in a tightly defined high time frame range, with $800 as resistance and $400 as support. As this range matures, the likelihood of a major breakout, or breakdown, increases. Until then, traders should prepare for continued oscillation and plan around key levels. Binance ( BNB ) has been consolidating for weeks, and the structure shows no signs of an immediate breakout. However, the ongoing sideways action is setting the stage for a larger volatility expansion in the near future once resistance or support breaks. Key technical points Range High: $800 resistance with deviation and rejection confirmed Range Low: $400 support, aligning with the 200 MA and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement Rotational Structure: Price action has respected both edges of the range, creating a clear oscillation pattern BNBUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView The $800 region is acting as a strong resistance level, with price failing to close convincingly above it. A clear deviation from this level has already occurred, confirming a rejection and a rotation back into the mid-range. This resistance aligns with the value area high and sits just above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both adding to its technical significance. You might also like: Musk’s X to offer investment and trading in ‘super app’: report If price continues to reject around this high time frame resistance, the probability increases for a full range rotation back to the $400 support. This support is a key technical zone, it coincides with the 200-day moving average and another 0.618 Fibonacci level, and it also holds untapped liquidity built over the past several months. A test of this area would offer a clean sweep of downside liquidity, potentially setting the stage for a stronger bullish reaction. BNB remains firmly within a rotational range structure, and no breakout has yet occurred. For long-term investors and swing traders, the optimal long opportunity likely lies near the $400 mark, should price revisit that level with confirmation. Until then, entering mid-range positions carries unnecessary risk. What to expect in the coming price action Unless BNB breaks above $800 or loses the $400 support, price is expected to continue ranging. Traders should focus on the edges of the range for positioning, with $400 acting as the ideal accumulation zone and $800 as the breakout trigger. Until a clear shift in structure appears, range-bound strategies remain favorable.

2025-06-19T17:44:28,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump Calls for Massive US Crypto Investment","Spot volumes climb whenever Bitcoin dips, and fresh stablecoin prints hint that sidelined capital is re-entering the market with purpose. Although Bitcoin has drifted into a cooling pattern, on-chain wallet growth remains steady, a classic mark of quiet accumulation. What traders lacked was a spark to convert that patience into conviction. They found it in Donald Trump’s newest volley of pro-crypto remarks. The President framed the current consolidation as a launch pad rather than a warning sign. His comments have already begun to ripple through order books, lifting depth and nudging funding rates higher as market participants position for a fresh swing in the short term. Why Trump’s Message Reshapes Global Sentiment When Washington speaks, liquidity desks from Frankfurt to Singapore reach for the volume knob. The United States still hosts the world’s deepest capital pools, and its policy choices shape the compliance playbooks of many other jurisdictions. That is why Donald Trump’s Truth Social post on 18 June resonated far outside American borders. The screenshot shows him celebrating a Senate vote that pushed a comprehensive digital-assets bill through the chamber, calling it “pure genius” and vowing to sign it the moment the House sends a clean version to his desk. Though the text does not specify the title, aides have hinted at a framework focused on strict asset backing for payment tokens, streamlined federal licensing, and clear guardrails for consumer protection. In practical terms, it would give banks and fintech firms a green light to launch fully collateralized dollar tokens, unlocking fresh demand for blockchain rails and likely accelerating institutional flows into Bitcoin as the benchmark collateral asset. Trump paired that optimism with another jab at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates unchanged. Lower borrowing costs would amplify the impact of any regulatory breakthrough by reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as Bitcoin. The combination of legislative momentum and pressure for easier monetary policy has already brightened derivative sentiment. Funding flipped positive on several Asian exchanges within hours, and European desks reported a sudden uptick in spot inquiries from family offices. If the bill becomes law, other governments are expected to follow with parallel initiatives, turning domestic development into a global adoption catalyst. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump’s Stance Could Trigger Global Interest Surge BTC Bull BTC Bull offers a creative way for accessing Bitcoin upside without the complexities of direct leverage or derivative exposure. Its design hinges on a supply adjustment mechanism that increases token issuance as Bitcoin’s price reaches defined thresholds. The concept is simple: every time Bitcoin reaches a particular price milestone, every BTCBULL token holder stands to win airdrops. What sets BTC Bull apart is its compatibility with long-term capital, especially from investors who prefer on-chain exposure with built-in directional acceleration. It offers a path that avoids liquidation risk and removes counterparty dependencies while still amplifying returns when BTC trends upward. Its emphasis on conservative treasury management helps insulate the protocol during choppy or sideways markets. While it does mainly seem like a meme coin, its utility is creative and well thought of, for the long term, a combination that really puts a heavy interest on the token. So for those looking to position ahead of structural growth in digital assets, BTC Bull provides a well-architected, autonomous exposure layer built specifically to enhance directional returns without the overhead of traditional financial tools. SUBBD SUBBD is built for creators who seek full control over how they monetize content, manage memberships, and engage communities. It provides an alternative to traditional subscription platforms by allowing each creator to deploy their own branded access token. These tokens grant tiered entry to private content feeds, community perks, and real-time engagement features, all embedded within a single on-chain ecosystem. Its utility lies in how the platform handles revenue and data ownership. Creators earn income instantly into self-custodied wallets, without relying on third-party payout schedules or enduring platform commissions. At the same time, content access is governed by smart contracts that enforce entitlements transparently: viewership, renewals, and tipping mechanisms are all automated, cutting down on manual moderation or billing disputes. What makes SUBBD particularly powerful is its backend modularity. It can support everything from gated video streams and course content to event-based ticketing or even exclusive DAO voting rights tied to creator governance. The platform includes built-in compliance tools like region-specific access restrictions, tax summary generation, and anti-bot verification, all of which are features that make it viable for scale and cross-border use without adding friction. 99Bitcoins , a leading educational YouTube channel, also vouched for the token’s potential, dubbing it as a 100x gem. Its utility is well aligned with a maturing digital economy, where creators are moving toward direct relationships with their audiences, disintermediation of platforms, and decentralized income channels. SUBBD equips them with exactly that: programmable infrastructure that supports sustainable, creator-first monetization while maintaining the flexibility to evolve with future digital payment frameworks and audience interaction models. Solaxy Solaxy is a layer-two blockchain that bridges two of the most significant ecosystems in crypto: Ethereum’s robust security layer and Solana’s high-throughput infrastructure. Rather than relying on a monolithic chain or compromising between performance and decentralization, Solaxy integrates the best of both through a dual-verification architecture. Transactions execute quickly on a Solana-compatible layer, while periodic proofs anchor finality to Ethereum’s base layer, offering scalability without compromising the integrity of historical data. The native currency is the SOLX token, which powers transactions, prioritization, and resource allocation through a dynamic fee structure that adjusts based on real-time network load. Developers are able to build applications that inherit Ethereum-grade security while benefiting from the low latency required for high-frequency interactions like trading, payments, or gaming. The protocol includes a compiler toolset that allows Ethereum-based projects to port their smart contracts into Solaxy’s environment with minimal friction. This enables Solaxy to serve as a migration hub for developers looking to expand to faster execution environments without leaving Ethereum’s ecosystem entirely. Projects gain not only speed but also broader interoperability, since assets and data can move between chains with native compatibility. Solaxy’s architecture supports applications that require fast confirmation times but still demand secure audit trails, such as digital payments, decentralized identity systems, or real-time marketplaces. It is not just another scaling solution, but also an execution layer optimized for modern use cases where speed, security, and cross-chain access must coexist by design. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token sits as the native token of a self-custody suite that treats the wallet as more than a key manager. Within the application, every balance, network bridge, and decentralized exchange route is abstracted into a single account view, allowing users to shift assets or stake liquidity through guided flows that feel closer to standard banking than to protocol dashboards. Holding BEST is the mechanism that unlocks those features. When a user routes trades through the in-app aggregator, a portion of the fee is automatically converted to BEST and redistributed to active stakers. This circular capture model turns each user into a partial beneficiary of aggregate network activity. BEST also reduces gas expenditure for supported chains through a pooled rebate fund, which becomes especially powerful when congestion peaks during market expansions. In practice, the token acts as both a participation credential and a cost-control tool. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 It has already raised upwards of $13 million, and could very likely be listed across many major exchanges shortly. Token holders can commit BEST to weight their vote on listings, interface upgrades, or new chain integrations. Because voting power decays if tokens sit idle, the model encourages continuous engagement rather than one-off governance events. That dynamic keeps development priorities aligned with features that drive real usage, such as native support for regulated stablecoin rails that may emerge if current policy discussions mature into law. Finally, a custodial-agnostic recovery layer is secured by an insurance pool funded with a fraction of swap fees settled in BEST. This reserve backs optional coverage for lost-key events, addressing a longstanding adoption hurdle by blending traditional assurance concepts with transparent on-chain accounting. Conclusion When national leadership not only acknowledges digital assets but actively pushes for their integration into financial policy, it forces a reassessment of what the next cycle might look like. For investors, the window ahead may favor tokens that do more than move with the market. The ones tied to actual mechanics like settlement, access, scalability, or utility stand to gain from a climate where functionality is finally being given the green light. The projects covered above each offer something grounded in purpose. Not hype, not noise, just well-engineered frameworks that may find stronger footing as the broader environment becomes more accommodating.

Nguồn cung giới hạn ở mức 21 triệu coin, cùng với công nghệ blockchain minh bạch, giúp mọi giao dịch đều có thể xác minh công khai. Michael Saylor tin rằng việc mã hóa (token hóa) toàn bộ tài sản trên blockchain sẽ mang lại nhiều lợi ích – từ việc tăng tính minh bạch cho đến giảm thiểu các điểm yếu trong hệ thống tài chính hiện tại. Chẳng hạn, tại Mỹ không tồn tại cơ sở dữ liệu tập trung nào cho cổ phần tư nhân hay bất động sản, khiến quy trình giao dịch trở nên phức tạp và tốn kém. Theo Saylor, Bitcoin là tài sản dự trữ lý tưởng để hỗ trợ quá trình token hóa nhờ vào tính phi tập trung của nó. Ông hình dung rằng trong tương lai, Bitcoin sẽ là đơn vị tiền tệ tiêu chuẩn cho việc mua bán và chuyển giao các tài sản được mã hóa – khiến việc sở hữu BTC trở thành điều tất yếu nếu muốn tham gia vào hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu mới. Saylor cũng nhận thấy động lực chính trị đang tăng lên để hiện thực hóa tầm nhìn này, đặc biệt dưới thời cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump – người được xem là nhà lãnh đạo ủng hộ tiền mã hóa mạnh mẽ nhất. Trump đã bổ nhiệm nhiều nhân vật có tư tưởng thân thiện với ngành công nghiệp này, bao gồm cả Paul Atkins – hiện là chủ tịch Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch (SEC). Saylor cho rằng bước đầu tiên để xây dựng một tương lai dựa trên blockchain là thiết lập một khuôn khổ pháp lý rõ ràng cho tài sản số. Việc xác định các quy tắc và luật pháp cụ thể sẽ giúp Hoa Kỳ trở thành hình mẫu để các quốc gia khác noi theo. Ông hình dung rằng với sự hợp tác toàn cầu, toàn bộ khối tài sản trị giá 500 nghìn tỷ USD trên thế giới có thể được mã hóa trên blockchain vào năm 2045. Nếu viễn cảnh này trở thành hiện thực, giá trị của mỗi Bitcoin có thể tăng lên tới 13 triệu USD. Dự đoán của Saylor kéo theo mức định giá khổng lồ Như đã đề cập trước đó, vốn hóa thị trường hiện tại của Bitcoin là khoảng 2,1 nghìn tỷ USD. Nếu giá mỗi BTC tăng lên 13 triệu USD, vốn hóa thị trường pha loãng hoàn toàn của Bitcoin sẽ tăng vọt lên khoảng 273 nghìn tỷ USD, dựa trên tổng cung tối đa 21 triệu coin. Để dễ hình dung, Bitcoin khi đó sẽ có giá trị gấp gần 6 lần toàn bộ chỉ số chứng khoán S&P 500, vốn đại diện cho 500 công ty hàng đầu với tổng vốn hóa là 47,5 nghìn tỷ USD. Nó cũng sẽ cao gấp 9 lần tổng GDP hàng năm của Hoa Kỳ, vốn đạt 29,7 nghìn tỷ USD vào năm ngoái. Vì lý do đó, nhiều người cho rằng dự báo của Saylor là thiếu thực tế. Việc thuyết phục tất cả các quốc gia chấp nhận token hóa và áp dụng Bitcoin sẽ đối mặt với nhiều rào cản chính trị và xã hội. Mỗi nền kinh tế vận hành theo một tốc độ riêng, và đồng tiền quốc gia đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc điều chỉnh thương mại. Ví dụ, các đồng tiền yếu hơn thường khiến hàng hóa xuất khẩu của quốc gia đó hấp dẫn hơn. Nếu tất cả các quốc gia buộc phải sử dụng Bitcoin, các nền kinh tế nhỏ hơn có thể gặp khó khăn khi cạnh tranh với các siêu cường như Mỹ hay Trung Quốc. Ngoài ra, các loại tiền pháp định có tỷ giá hối đoái linh hoạt mang lại khả năng chống chịu trước cú sốc kinh tế. Chẳng hạn, khi Vương quốc Anh bỏ phiếu rời EU vào năm 2016, đồng bảng Anh đã mất khoảng 20% giá trị so với đồng USD. Sự mất giá này giúp làm giảm tác động của suy thoái bằng cách khiến hàng xuất khẩu Anh trở nên rẻ hơn. Nếu khi đó Anh đã sử dụng Bitcoin như phần còn lại của thế giới, họ có thể đã rơi vào một cuộc suy thoái nghiêm trọng hơn. Bitcoin vẫn có thể là một khoản đầu tư đáng cân nhắc Mặc dù mục tiêu giá 13 triệu USD của Michael Saylor có thể nghe hơi phi thực tế, điều đó không có nghĩa là Bitcoin là một khoản đầu tư tồi. Với nguồn cung cố định là 21 triệu coin, Bitcoin ngày càng được xem như một tài sản kỹ thuật số khan hiếm – tương tự như “vàng kỹ thuật số”. Để so sánh, tổng giá trị của toàn bộ lượng vàng đã khai thác hiện nay vào khoảng 23,1 nghìn tỷ USD. Nếu Bitcoin muốn đạt được mức vốn hóa tương đương, giá của mỗi BTC sẽ phải tăng gấp 10 lần, đạt khoảng 1,1 triệu USD. Điều này khiến mục tiêu 1 triệu USD của Saylor trở nên khả thi hơn trong trung hạn. Tuy nhiên, nhà đầu tư nên nhớ rằng Bitcoin vẫn là một tài sản mang tính đầu cơ. Nó không tạo ra doanh thu hay dòng tiền, nên giá trị của nó hoàn toàn phụ thuộc vào việc người mua tiếp theo sẵn sàng trả bao nhiêu – điều này luôn là một ẩn số. Ngoài ra, cần lưu ý rằng: MicroStrategy hiện đang nắm giữ 582.000 BTC, tương đương 60 tỷ USD, do đó Michael Saylor có lợi ích trực tiếp khi đưa ra các dự đoán tăng giá táo bạo.

2025-06-19T17:35:10,"Majority of Russian miners are operating outside the law","Efforts to legalize the activities of crypto miners in Russia haven’t been particularly fruitful and only about 30% have so far registered with the country’s tax authority. The assessment comes from the finance ministry in Moscow, which says it’s working to bring the rest of the growing industry out of the shadows, the main purpose of regulating the sector. Majority of Russian miners minting outside the law Less than a third of all Russian entities involved in cryptocurrency mining have been added to the special register of the Federal Tax Service (FNS) which allows them to operate legally, according to the Ministry of Finance (Minfin). The legalization of the Bitcoin-related business, which has been expanding in the energy-rich Russian Federation, is far from complete, Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov told Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS. “Our general approach, when we introduced regulation, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible,” Chebeskov reminded. Also quoted by Russian crypto media outlets Bits.media and RBC Crypto, he admitted: “So far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the FNS, and this process is still far from complete.” The Minfin official emphasized his department will continue work to legalize the remaining two-thirds of the crypto mining sector. These efforts started last year when Russia adopted legislation designed to regulate the crypto activity. Since the new law entered into force in November 2024, companies and individual entrepreneurs can mine legally as long as they register with the Russian tax authority and pay due taxes . Private citizens minting digital currencies are not required to do that, as long as they use less than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. The FNS registry was launched in January and by April 1, registration entries had reached 722, including 116 “mining infrastructure operators,” or providers of hosting services and data center operators. Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Tatarstan account of the highest number legal miners in Russia. Fines and crypto seizure await illegal crypto miners Many miners prefer to remain in the shadow economy as they fear criminal prosecution over illegally imported equipment, RBC noted in its report. According to the business news portal, an amnesty is already being discussed between legislators and industry members. Those who decide to continue to mine illegally are going to face heavy fines and other punitive measures, including confiscation of the minted cryptocurrency. According to amendments to Russia’s Code of Administrative Offenses, currently under consideration, the monetary penalties may reach 2 million rubles ($25,000) for companies and 400,000 rubles ($5,000) for private individuals. Russia mulls lower electricity rates for legal mining farms Illegal, also called “gray” crypto miners in Russia have been blamed for increasing electricity deficits in a number of Russian regions. Authorities have reacted by banning all mining in almost a dozen territories and subjects of the Russian Federation. Critics say this hurts legal mining businesses, bringing down tax revenues and electricity sales. “We need to regulate mining, not ban it,” Russia’s Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabchak was quoted as stating on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Speaking to TASS, he elaborated: “The Ministry of Energy sees the point not in prohibition, but in more subtle regulation of mining.” Earlier in June, Grabchak told reporters that his department favors regulatory changes that will help avoid restrictions on cryptocurrency mining in some parts of the country and is working on incentives to attract miners to regions with surplus energy. Now he revealed these may include offering take-or-pay tariffs for the electricity consumed by legal mining farms. He noted the rates “won’t be much lower, but they will be more long-term.” In May, he hinted on adding miners to a separate category of consumers enjoying lower energy prices that will apply across all Russian regions.

2025-06-19T17:20:55,"XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions","BitcoinWorld XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions Global events have a powerful ripple effect, and the world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Recently, the escalating situation involving Middle East tensions has sent shivers through financial markets, including the digital asset space. For many, the focus is squarely on how this uncertainty impacts their portfolios, and specifically, what it means for the XRP price . What Are XRP Traders Doing Amid the Uncertainty? According to reports, particularly from DL News, XRP traders are reacting to the geopolitical climate by bracing for potential declines. The derivatives exchange Deribit has reportedly seen increased activity from traders taking bearish positions on XRP. This means they are essentially betting that the XRP price will fall further. These traders are anticipating a notable drop, with some positioning for an additional 5% decrease in XRP’s value. This isn’t just random speculation; it reflects a growing bearish sentiment specifically targeting XRP in the wake of heightened global risk. Why are XRP traders so sensitive to this news? Geopolitical instability often leads investors to move away from riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, while sometimes seen as uncorrelated, frequently react negatively to events that threaten global stability or signal potential economic disruption. How Are Middle East Tensions Shaking the Crypto Market? The connection between Middle East tensions and the crypto market might not be immediately obvious, but it’s a significant one. Major geopolitical events introduce uncertainty and increase risk aversion among investors worldwide. When tensions escalate: Investors seek safety: Capital tends to flow out of assets perceived as risky (like stocks and cryptocurrencies) and into safer havens (like government bonds or gold). Economic outlook darkens: Conflict can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, and generally create a less favorable environment for economic growth, dampening enthusiasm for speculative assets. Policy responses: Governments and central banks might signal policy shifts in response to the crisis, further influencing market direction. The recent signals from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding potential U.S. involvement added another layer of complexity and concern, amplifying the market’s reaction. This isn’t just affecting XRP; the broader crypto market , including giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has also experienced declines, demonstrating the systemic impact of these global events. Decoding the Bearish Sentiment: Why Are Traders Betting Down? The prevailing bearish sentiment among XRP traders isn’t solely tied to geopolitical fears, although that’s a major catalyst right now. Bearish sentiment reflects a collective expectation that an asset’s price is likely to fall. Several factors contribute to this outlook: Geopolitical Risk: As discussed, escalating Middle East tensions are a primary driver, increasing overall market fear. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession can contribute to risk-off attitudes. Technical Analysis: Traders often look at price charts and patterns. If XRP’s chart shows signs of weakness or breaks key support levels, it can reinforce a bearish view. Market Contagion: When major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin experience declines, it often pulls altcoins like XRP down with them, regardless of their individual fundamentals. The weakness in the broader crypto market contributes significantly to the negative outlook for XRP. Specific XRP Factors: While less prominent in this specific report, ongoing regulatory discussions or developments related to Ripple’s legal status can also influence sentiment around the XRP price . The accumulation of these factors can create a powerful wave of bearish sentiment , leading traders to open short positions or sell their holdings in anticipation of lower prices. Broader Crypto Market Reaction: Is It Just XRP? While the report highlights XRP traders specifically, it’s crucial to understand that the reaction is not isolated. The entire crypto market is interconnected and sensitive to major external shocks. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often dictates the overall trend. When Bitcoin sees selling pressure due to global events or macro fears, altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, and others typically follow suit, often with greater volatility. The declines observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum following the news signals underscore that the current downturn is a market-wide phenomenon, triggered by the same underlying fear driven by Middle East tensions . This collective movement reinforces the bearish sentiment across the board, impacting the XRP price as part of the larger ecosystem. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for XRP Traders Trading during times of heightened volatility and bearish sentiment can be challenging, but informed decisions are key. Here are some actionable insights for XRP traders : Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the XRP price moves against your position. Stay Informed, Avoid Panic: Keep track of geopolitical developments and market analysis, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or hype. Understand Middle East tensions are a factor, but not the only one. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While focusing on XRP, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different assets or even different sectors within crypto. Understand Derivatives Risk: If you are trading derivatives like those on Deribit, be acutely aware of the leverage involved and the potential for rapid losses, especially with significant bearish sentiment in play. Look for Opportunities (with caution): Volatility can present opportunities for those with a strategy. This might involve shorting (betting on price decline) if you are experienced, or identifying potential entry points if you believe the long-term outlook for the XRP price remains positive despite short-term headwinds. However, timing the market is extremely difficult. Re-evaluate Your Thesis: Step back and consider if the current situation fundamentally changes your long-term view on XRP and the crypto market . For many, observing from the sidelines during extreme uncertainty might be the most prudent strategy. The goal is to preserve capital and be ready when clearer trends emerge. Summary: Geopolitics Casts a Shadow on XRP and the Crypto Market In conclusion, the report highlighting XRP traders positioning for declines underscores the significant impact of global events, particularly Middle East tensions , on the digital asset space. The growing bearish sentiment is a direct response to the increased risk and uncertainty introduced by the geopolitical climate and broader market reactions. While XRP price is specifically mentioned due to trader positioning on platforms like Deribit, this reflects a wider trend affecting the entire crypto market , including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Navigating these turbulent times requires careful consideration, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of how external factors can influence the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading.

The investment will be used to scale validator capacity, deepen cross-chain liquidity rails, and fast-track the launch of two key AI primitives: an AI Launchpad and an AI Liquidity Manager. Both tools will empower developers and traders with on-chain access to intelligence-driven market products. Building the Future of On-Chain AI With the convergence of AI and blockchain moving from theory to production, Units.Network is positioning itself at the centre of this emerging frontier. Analysts project the blockchain-AI market to grow from $0.7 billion in 2025 to $1.9 billion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of around 28%. The launch of Units.Network’s AI Launchpad is intended to lower the barrier of entry for innovators, while the AI Liquidity Manager is designed to create fairer and more efficient markets. “This investment allows us to place practical artificial intelligence at the centre of our ecosystem,” said Sasha Ivanov. “The Launchpad lowers barriers for innovators, and the liquidity manager will create fairer and more efficient markets for builders and traders.” Robert Baker, Managing Partner at Nimbus Capital, added: “We’ve been tracking the AI-blockchain convergence closely, and Units.Network stood out for delivering real on-chain utility.” Market Momentum and Community Expansion Beyond institutional backing, Units.Network is also accelerating community growth. The project recently launched a DAO-led performance grant program, offering incentives to developers whose applications attract over $1 million in total value locked (TVL). These grants are expected to support a healthy pipeline of ecosystem projects ahead of the Launchpad’s public debut later this year. Retail interest in AI-linked crypto tokens has surged, with combined valuations rising from $2.7 billion to more than $26 billion in the past year, outpacing Bitcoin’s performance.

2025-06-19T17:00:10,"Why The June 22 Date Is Important As Bitcoin Price Flirts With $100,000","The Bitcoin price action is currently testing investors’ nerves as it hovers around $100,000. While it flirts with this psychological level, analysts are highlighting June 22, 2025, as a key date for potential volatility. Backed by both historical volatility patterns and technical indicators, this date is gearing up to be a critical window for Bitcoin’s next move. Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility On June 22 Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as it trades above the $100,000 mark, with technical signals identified by TradingView expert ‘readCrypto’ aligning around a critical time frame—-June 22. The chart analysis shows that June 22 is an important date, signaling the projected start of Bitcoin’s next volatility window, with a potential to break out or break down depending on how the flagship cryptocurrency reacts to key support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,731, close to a pivotal confluence range between $104,463 and $106,133—a zone highlighted as a structural mid-point. This area is defined by the DOM (60) and a Heikin-Ashi high point on the price chart, marking the formation of a recent upper boundary. Moreover, the lower end of the range sits around $99,705, which is the HA-High support level, where the price has previously been tested but not yet broken. According to the analyst, the June 22 date is important because it coincides with the confluence of key price levels with the M-Signal indicator on the weekly chart. This indicator is currently rising and aligning near the $99,705 HA-high level. If Bitcoin falls below this level, it could signal the start of a deeper corrective move, possibly toward the monthly M-Signal line or even the $89,294 region, corresponding with the 2.618 Fibonacci. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above this level and breaks out of the $108,316 resistance, momentum could shift back to the upside. The analyst has set upper bullish targets near $109,598 and $111,696, reflecting the final resistance zone before new highs. Support Zones And Momentum Indicate Tense Standoff Moving past readCrypto’s volatility-driven projection, the TradingView analyst’s Bitcoin chart shows that the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) oscillator remains below the zero line. This suggests that despite recent gains, selling pressure may still be dominating the broader market. However, the histogram in the chart shows signs of waning momentum on the sell side. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This divergence aligns with Bitcoin’s weakening Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates momentum may be cooling. The low OBV readings, combined with the recent bounce from a lower support range, also underscore an intense standoff within the market. If Bitcoin breaks below the Heikin Ashi high point at $99,705, a retest of new lows at $89,294 is more than likely. Until then, readCrypto’s analysis shows that all eyes are on the $104,000 to $106,000 zone. The area between $99,705 and $108,316 now defines the high-boundary consolidation range. A confirmed move outside this range, mainly triggered during the June 21-13 window, could dictate Bitcoin’s next major move.

The Berwyn, Alberta-based facility was unveiled with BlueFlare Energy and is now running on 425 kilowatts (kW), delivering a hashrate of 32 petahashes per second (PH/s). Stranded gas refers to natural gas that is not able to be delivered to market due to logistics or economics. AgriFORCE’s process enables unused gas to be turned into computer power without having to navigate the years-long permitting and infrastructure bottleneck. Two Additional Sites Planned Across Alberta AgriFORCE has executed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare Energy to expand its model of mining into two new sites in Oyen and Hinton, Alberta. The new sites would be a carbon copy of the Berwyn model, further expanding the company’s foray into gas-powered crypto mining. “We don’t wait on permits or grid upgrades — we convert gas to compute in weeks, not years,” CEO Jolie Kahn said. AgriFORCE’s Bitcoin Strategy: Hold and Expand The company revealed that it has mined already 7 Bitcoin with an approximate value of $735,000 from operations in Alberta and Ohio. The mined BTC of up to 50% of AgriFORCE will be reserved in treasury while the balance will be employed to facilitate operational expansion. The company may also utilize up to 50% of funds raised to directly buy Bitcoin. Stock Performance and Financial Outlook AgriFORCE shares (AGRI) rose 1.85% to finish trading on Tuesday at $1.10. While there was the daily gain, the company is down over 53% year to date, according to Google Finance. Still, the company produced solid financials in 2024, with revenue jumping 317% and net profit increasing 66% year over year. Renewable Energy Picks Up Speed in Crypto Mining AgriFORCE is part of a broader trend within the crypto mining industry: shifting to alternative and renewable sources of energy. According to TheMinerMag, the price of one BTC to produce in Q1 2025 hit $64,000 and will rise to $70,000 by the end of Q2. With increased energy prices, miners are looking more towards renewable resources. A new report showed a growth in the adoption of renewable energy by Bitcoin miners at 5.8% per year, while reliance on coal is gradually reducing.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/agriforce-powers-120-bitcoin-mining-rigs-with-stranded-natural-gas-in-alberta/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare

Paula Comings, head of FX sales at US Bank, says in a new interview with Bloomberg that American importers have been reporting to her that their foreign export partners want to be paid in the euro, Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Comings notes that exporters want to limit their exposure to the dollar’s price movement. “A lot of clients previously were reluctant because dollars were sacred in the eyes of the supplier. Now the vibe from overseas vendors seems to be, ‘Just give us our currency.’” For example, one US Bank client, a lumber company from the Midwest, now uses euros to purchase hardwood imports from Europe, while a second, a homeware retailer, now plans to pay for imports from China with yuan. Both firms previously used dollars to pay exporters. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at 98.92 at time of writing. The index is up 5% in the past five days but down nearly 9% year to date. US Bank has $659.191 billion in total assets as of March 31st, 2025, per statistics from the Federal Reserve.

KuCoin said that through this integration, institutional clients can now trade on KuCoin without the need to pre-fund exchange wallets. Instead, assets remain securely held under BitGo Singapore’s regulated custody, introducing a separation of custody and execution that reduces counterparty risk and bolsters systemic resilience. Security, Flexibility, and Post-Trade Automation The firm said that this collaboration will give institutional clients access to KuCoin’s trading products—including spot, margin, options, and perpetual futures—through the Go Network. Clients will have access to custody with insurance coverage up to $250 million, automated post-trade settlement, and delegated trading access without compromising asset control. “Security and trust are the foundation for institutional adoption. We are proud to integrate with BitGo Singapore’s Go Network. This partnership represents a critical component of our $2 billion Trust Project and delivers a more resilient trading paradigm to institutional clients globally,” said Tika Lum, Head of Institutional Business Development at KuCoin. New Model for Crypto Trading? Off-exchange settlement is gaining traction across the industry as exchanges and institutional participants prioritize counterparty risk management. BitGo’s Go Network represents a mature infrastructure standard, already trusted by leading firms for secure digital asset trading. “Partnering with KuCoin on Go Network through BitGo Singapore marks a major step forward in building a more efficient trading ecosystem. This is how digital asset trading should be—secure, compliant, and built on trust,” said Brett Reeves, Head of Go Network at BitGo. With the $2 billion Trust Project as its foundation, KuCoin is reinforcing its commitment to developing trusted digital asset infrastructure. KuCoin BTC Reserves Collapse KuCoin saw a dramatic drop in its Bitcoin reserves since mid-2023, when it announced a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement. Since that period, the exchange has seen a 77% decline in its Bitcoin reserves. According to data compiled by Onchain School, KuCoin’s BTC reserves dropped from 18,300 BTC to just 4,100 BTC between June 5 and June 28, 2023. The outflow totaling over 14,000 BTC correlates closely with the timeline of KuCoin’s announcement to tighten its KYC procedures.

2025-06-19T16:30:00,"Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum’s Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Altcoin Recovery: Ethereum’s Crucial Role in the Crypto Market Shift Is the much-anticipated Altcoin recovery finally on the horizon? For many investors holding various digital assets, this is the burning question. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, attention is increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as the potential catalyst for broader market gains. Why is Ethereum Price Key to Altcoin Recovery? According to insights shared by experts like Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, the fate of many altcoins is currently tied directly to Ethereum’s performance. He suggests that for investors to see their altcoin positions return to profitability or achieve significant gains, ETH needs to demonstrate stronger momentum and resilience in the market. Think of it this way: Ethereum is the largest altcoin by market cap and serves as the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other altcoins built on its blockchain or EVM-compatible chains. When Ethereum is strong, it signals health and activity in this ecosystem, which often spills over positively into the performance of associated altcoins. Van de Poppe’s view highlights a crucial point: without a robust ETH showing, the capital needed to fuel significant rallies in smaller altcoins might remain stagnant or exit the market. A rising Ethereum price can increase confidence, liquidity, and risk appetite, all essential ingredients for an Altcoin season . Entering the ‘Ethereum Phase’ of the Crypto Market Adding weight to the narrative, on-chain analyst Willy Woo recently posited that the broader Crypto market is transitioning into what he terms an ‘Ethereum phase’. This suggests a potential shift in market dynamics where Ethereum, rather than just Bitcoin, becomes the primary driver or indicator of market sentiment and direction. Michaël van de Poppe agrees with Woo’s assessment of this fundamental shift. However, he notes a common disconnect: many investors remain unaware of this transition. They are still influenced by a lingering ‘markets are bad’ mindset, perhaps conditioned by previous downturns, and haven’t fully grasped Ethereum’s growing influence and potential leadership role in the current cycle. What might an ‘Ethereum phase’ entail? It could mean: Increased focus on Ethereum’s fundamentals (e.g., staking yields, network upgrades, EIPs). Higher correlation between ETH and many altcoins compared to the traditional BTC-altcoin correlation. Ethereum’s price movements acting as a leading indicator for specific sectors within the crypto market (like DeFi or NFTs). Greater institutional interest specifically in Ethereum as a programmable settlement layer and yield-bearing asset. Understanding this potential phase shift is vital for investors looking to navigate the coming months and capitalize on potential opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Examining the ETH Price Prediction Trajectory Beyond its fundamental role, the technical price action of Ethereum is also generating significant interest. Crypto analyst Ted has drawn parallels between Ethereum’s current trajectory and Bitcoin’s historical price movement during its 2017–2021 cycle. This comparison is significant because Bitcoin’s 2017-2021 period included its massive bull run. If Ethereum were to follow a similar path, it could imply substantial upside potential from current levels. Ted’s analysis suggests that a real parabolic move – a rapid, accelerating increase in price – could commence once ETH decisively breaks and sustains above the $4,000 mark. Hitting $4,000 would not only represent a significant psychological and technical resistance break but would also bring ETH closer to its previous all-time high. Surpassing this level could trigger a wave of positive sentiment, potentially leading to further price discovery and reinforcing the idea that the market is indeed entering a more bullish phase, supportive of Altcoin recovery . Challenges and Considerations While the outlook linking ETH strength to altcoin gains is compelling, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile. Unforeseen macroeconomic events or regulatory news could impact ETH and altcoins negatively. Bitcoin Dominance: While the narrative suggests an ‘Ethereum phase’, Bitcoin’s influence is still substantial. A strong BTC rally that pulls liquidity from altcoins could temporarily hinder the ‘Ethereum phase’ thesis. Execution Risks: While Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong, the successful execution of future upgrades is crucial for its long-term health and appeal. Altcoin Specific Risks: Even with a strong ETH, individual altcoins face unique risks related to their technology, team, adoption, and competition. Investors should conduct their own research and not solely rely on broad market trends or predictions. Diversification and risk management remain paramount. Conclusion: Watching Ethereum for the Next Big Move The consensus among several prominent analysts points towards Ethereum as the primary driver for the next wave of Altcoin recovery . From its fundamental role in the crypto ecosystem to its technical price trajectory mirroring past bull runs, ETH’s performance is seen as the crucial barometer for whether the broader Crypto market can enter a truly bullish phase. The idea of an ‘Ethereum phase’, where ETH leads the charge, is gaining traction, even if many retail investors haven’t fully recognized it yet. While price predictions like the move past $4,000 for a parabolic run offer exciting potential, it’s essential to remain aware of market dynamics and individual asset risks. Ultimately, for those waiting for an Altcoin season , keeping a close eye on Ethereum price action and network developments appears to be the most strategic approach.

2025-06-19T16:20:00,"Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Tax Breakthrough: State House Approves $200 Exemption Bill Big news out of the Buckeye State! The Ohio House of Representatives has taken a significant step that could make small cryptocurrency transactions much simpler for residents. In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community, lawmakers in Ohio have passed a bill aiming to exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from capital gains tax. This development is particularly relevant for anyone engaging in frequent, small-value trades or using crypto for minor purchases in the state. Understanding the Proposed Ohio Crypto Tax Exemption At the heart of this legislative effort is the desire to ease the tax burden and reporting complexity associated with small cryptocurrency transactions. Currently, under federal and typically state law, selling, trading, or using cryptocurrency for goods and services can trigger a taxable event. If the value of the crypto has increased since you acquired it, you could owe capital gains tax on that appreciation, even on very small amounts. The bill recently passed by the Ohio House seeks to create an exemption for this. Specifically, it targets transactions where the gain realized is less than $200. This means if you buy crypto, and later sell it, trade it for another crypto, or use it to buy something, and the profit (the difference between the sale price and your cost basis) is less than $200, that specific gain would be exempt from state capital gains tax in Ohio. This is a crucial detail – the exemption applies to the *gain*, not the total transaction value. Let’s break down what this exemption aims to address: Micro-Transactions: Using crypto for everyday purchases, like buying a coffee or a small item, can currently create complex tax reporting obligations for tiny gains. Frequent Small Trades: Active traders making many small profitable trades face a significant tracking burden. Tax Complexity: Many users find calculating and reporting capital gains tax on crypto confusing, especially for small amounts. By introducing this exemption, Ohio lawmakers hope to remove some of these hurdles, potentially encouraging greater use and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the state without creating unintended tax headaches for minor activities. What is the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act? The bill carrying this significant crypto tax exemption is formally known as the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. While the tax provision is a headline feature, the act’s name suggests it might encompass broader legislative efforts related to blockchain technology and digital assets within the state. Legislation labeled as ‘Basics Acts’ often aims to establish foundational legal definitions, rights, and frameworks for emerging technologies. The passage of this act in the House with a strong 70-26 vote indicates significant bipartisan support for creating a more favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Ohio. It signals that state legislators are actively considering how to integrate these technologies into the existing legal and economic structure, starting with fundamental issues like taxation. While the full text of the bill likely covers more than just the tax exemption, this specific provision is the most immediately impactful for individual cryptocurrency users. It positions Ohio as one of the states exploring ways to adapt its tax code to the unique nature of digital assets and the potential for frequent, low-value transactions. How Does This Impact Cryptocurrency Tax Reporting for Ohio Residents? If this bill becomes law, it would directly affect how Ohio residents calculate and report their state-level capital gains tax related to crypto. Currently, any gain, no matter how small, is technically subject to tax and reporting requirements. The proposed exemption would create a specific carve-out. Consider these scenarios: Scenario A: You bought 0.01 ETH for $200. Later, you sell it for $210. Your gain is $10. Under the proposed law, this $10 gain would likely be exempt from Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario B: You bought 0.1 BTC for $3,000. Later, you sell it for $3,250. Your gain is $250. Since this gain is over the $200 threshold, the full $250 gain would still be subject to Ohio state capital gains tax. Scenario C: You use 0.005 BTC (which you acquired for $100) to buy a $150 item. At the time of the transaction, that 0.005 BTC was worth $150. Your gain is $50 ($150 value received – $100 cost basis). This $50 gain would likely be exempt. Important Note: This exemption, if enacted, would only apply to Ohio state capital gains tax. Federal capital gains tax rules, which currently do not have such a de minimis exemption for crypto, would still apply. Ohio residents would still need to track all transactions for federal reporting purposes. The primary benefit here is reducing the state-level tax liability and potentially simplifying state tax filings for those with only small crypto gains. However, the need for diligent record-keeping doesn’t disappear entirely, as users still need to determine if a gain exceeds the $200 threshold and track their cost basis for all transactions for federal tax purposes. The Road Ahead: Senate and Governor’s Desk Passing the House is a significant hurdle cleared, but the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act is not yet law. The bill must now make its way through the Ohio State Senate. The Senate will review the bill, potentially hold committee hearings, and may propose amendments before holding a vote. If the Senate passes the bill, it will then head to the desk of Governor Mike DeWine for his signature. The Governor has the power to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature after a certain period. Given the strong House vote, there is positive momentum, but passage in the Senate and approval by the Governor are still necessary steps. The legislative process can be complex, and the exact timeline is uncertain. Those interested in seeing this crypto tax exemption become law should follow its progress through the Senate. Why is This Crypto Tax Exemption Significant for Ohio? This move by the Ohio House is more than just a tax tweak; it’s a statement. It signals that Ohio is serious about understanding and potentially fostering the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries within its borders. By addressing one of the major pain points for crypto users – the complexity of tax reporting on small gains – the state aims to make engaging with digital assets less cumbersome. Potential benefits for Ohio include: Attracting Innovation: A clear and favorable regulatory environment, even on tax matters, can make Ohio more attractive to blockchain companies and developers. Encouraging Adoption: Reducing the tax burden on small transactions could encourage more residents and businesses to use crypto for payments or small investments. Setting a Precedent: Ohio could become an example for other states looking to modernize their tax laws for digital assets. While a $200 exemption might seem modest in the context of large crypto investments, it directly impacts the most frequent types of transactions and the broadest base of users who might be experimenting with or using crypto for minor purposes. It’s a practical step that addresses a real-world friction point. Potential Criticisms or Challenges Despite the positive reception from many in the crypto community, the bill isn’t without potential points of discussion or criticism: Limited Scope: The $200 gain threshold is relatively low compared to the potential value of larger crypto holdings. It primarily benefits those with small gains. Tracking Still Required: Users still need to track their cost basis and sale price for *all* transactions to determine if a gain occurred and whether it falls under the $200 threshold for state exemption. This doesn’t eliminate the need for good record-keeping. Federal vs. State Discrepancy: Having different rules for state and federal tax can add another layer of complexity for taxpayers and tax professionals. These points highlight that while the bill is a step forward, the landscape of cryptocurrency tax remains complex, and users must stay informed and maintain meticulous records regardless of exemption thresholds. What Actionable Insights Should Ohio Residents Take? For cryptocurrency holders in Ohio, the most important takeaway right now is to stay informed. The bill has passed the House but is not yet law. Keep an eye on its progress through the Senate and towards the Governor’s office. Regardless of the bill’s final status, continue to practice diligent record-keeping for all your cryptocurrency transactions. This includes recording: The date of the transaction The type of cryptocurrency The number of units bought, sold, or traded The value of the transaction in U.S. dollars at the time Your cost basis (the price you paid for the crypto) The nature of the transaction (buy, sell, trade, spend) Using crypto tax software or maintaining a detailed spreadsheet can be invaluable. If the bill becomes law, you will need these records to identify which gains, if any, qualify for the state exemption. Conclusion: A Positive Step for Ohio Crypto Tax The passage of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act, including its crypto tax exemption for gains under $200, by the State House is a significant and positive development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Ohio. It demonstrates a legislative willingness to address practical challenges faced by individuals engaging with digital assets and positions the state as forward-thinking in its approach to blockchain technology. While the bill still has further steps to clear before becoming law, its progress reflects growing recognition among policymakers of the need to adapt tax regulations to the realities of the digital economy. This move could encourage greater participation in the crypto space within Ohio and potentially inspire similar legislative efforts in other states, contributing to a clearer and more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies nationwide.

The amendment was rejected on procedural grounds, halting what could have been a landmark discussion for France’s energy and digital finance strategy.Proposal to Study State-Supported Bitcoin MiningOn Monday, French lawmakers proposed integrating Bitcoin mining into the national energy strategy to utilize €80 million of unused electricity, largely generated from nuclear overproduction.Amendment No. 547 argued that Bitcoin mining’s flexible energy consumption could help absorb surplus electricity, reduce strain on reactors, and support grid balancing. The plan considered locating mining facilities near power plants, reviving dormant industrial sites, and repurposing mining-generated heat for urban or industrial use.Moreover, the proposal framed Bitcoin mining as a low-carbon, regulated solution aligned with France’s climate objectives. However, in the most recent development, the ambitious proposal has quickly hit a procedural roadblock.Dismissed on Procedural GroundsDespite its emphasis on infrastructure efficiency and innovation, the Assembly ruled the amendment inadmissible under Article 98 of its Rules of Procedure.The rejection was not based on the proposal’s content but on procedural grounds. According to local reports, the amendment was likely classified as a legislative rider, meaning it lacked sufficient relevance to the primary subject of the bill to which it was attached.Such dismissals are common in parliamentary procedure and do not rule out the possibility of revisiting the topic through more appropriate legislative channels.Had the proposal moved forward, France could have joined a small but growing group of countries, including Bhutan and El Salvador , exploring sovereign Bitcoin mining initiatives.Analysts believe a revised amendment, more closely aligned with the core bill, could be reintroduced. However, given the current political climate and ongoing concerns about Bitcoin’s environmental impact, any near-term revival of the idea appears unlikely.France Maintains a Cautious Stance on BitcoinGovernment officials have consistently voiced concerns over Bitcoin mining's environmental footprint and high energy consumption. As a result, potential benefits, such as monetizing excess renewable or nuclear energy through regulated mining, remain largely absent from mainstream policy discussions.Industry Sees a Missed OpportunityMeanwhile, the crypto community commentators view the decision as a missed opportunity for France. Alex Stanczyk, Managing Director at Swan Private Wealth, warned that such choices risk putting nations at a disadvantage in what he described as a “digital financial arms race.” He noted that countries embracing Bitcoin may gain a competitive edge, while those resisting adoption could fall behind, limiting future economic opportunities for their citizens.https://twitter.com/alexstanczyk/status/1935685063208829287",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/19/french-lawmakers-reject-proposal-to-explore-state-backed-bitcoin-mining/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=french-lawmakers-reject-proposal-to-explore-state-backed-bitcoin-mining,"BTC|MARKET|MINING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

In a recent interview titled ""The End of Fiat Is Now,"" Salinas expressed his confidence that Bitcoin's market cap will soon rival gold’s $22 trillion value. He believes that Bitcoin will increase at least eightfold from its present value of $105,000 per coin to match gold's valuation. Bitcoin Rivaling Gold's CapSalinas compared Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of around $2 trillion to gold’s market cap of $22 trillion. This comparison suggests that Bitcoin has significant room for growth. If Bitcoin were to match gold’s market cap of $22 trillion, its price would be approximately $1.1 million per coin.The billionaire is optimistic that Bitcoin will eventually surpass gold’s value, especially as the cryptocurrency continues to gain traction. He envisions a future where Bitcoin serves as the next reserve asset, replacing traditional fiat currencies and assets like gold.Salinas’ views are grounded in his belief that Bitcoin is gaining ground over gold. He pointed out the recent downward trend in gold’s value, which contrasts with Bitcoin’s growth. For context, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed gold in recent years, with impressive gains of 156% in 2023 and 121% in 2024. In contrast, gold has shown modest growth, including a 14% increase in 2023 and a 26.59% growth in 2024, highlighting Bitcoin's stronger momentum in comparison. Bitcoin vs Gold Annual Returns Bitcoin vs Gold Annual Returns Salinas’ Personal Investment StrategySalinas, who holds an estimated $5.8 billion fortune, has increasingly allocated a substantial portion of his wealth to Bitcoin. In his recent Bloomberg interview, he revealed that Bitcoin now constitutes around 70% of his liquid portfolio. This marks a significant increase from his previous holdings in 2020, when Bitcoin made up 60% of his portfolio. In addition to Bitcoin, he maintains a 30% allocation in gold and gold miners.Salinas emphasized that his personal portfolio is focused solely on Bitcoin and gold-related investments. He has no bonds or stocks other than his own business ventures. Bitcoin as a Tool for Personal FreedomIn his book The Bitcoin Enlightenment , Salinas presents Bitcoin not only as an investment but also as a tool for individual freedom. He argues that Bitcoin offers a path to escape government control, inflation, and taxation. According to Salinas, these elements are forms of theft, and Bitcoin provides a way to regain control over personal finances.He emphasizes that individuals must first embrace personal responsibility and values such as honesty and non-violence. Once these principles are in place, he believes Bitcoin can be the means to achieve true freedom, particularly in an era of increasing government interference.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/19/mexican-billionaire-says-bitcoin-will-be-more-valuable-than-golds-22-trillion-market/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mexican-billionaire-says-bitcoin-will-be-more-valuable-than-golds-22-trillion-market,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

Approximately $3.9 billion worth of options contracts will reach expiration on Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange. $3.9 Billion in Crypto Options to Expire on Deribit as Investors Turn Bullish on Ethereum This event is expected to cause significant volatility in both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets. Of the total, $3.3 billion is made up of the notional value of Bitcoin options. The Put/Call ratio is at 1.16, indicating a slight downtrend as traders hold more put options than calls. However, the maximum pain point is set at $106,000, which is the price at which the option will become worthless, suggesting a relatively neutral positioning. Market data suggests that BTC options are clustered around this level, suggesting a balanced outlook from investors ahead of expiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum options total $546 million and the Put/Call ratio is just 0.68, a clear sign of bullish sentiment among traders. The maximum pain price for ETH is $2,600, but option activity is weighted towards call positions, indicating strong expectations for an upward price movement. The concept of maximum pain, where the most options expire worthless, is often cited as a short-term price magnet during expiration events. As such, current levels of $106,000 for BTC and $2,600 for ETH could act as centers of attraction in the hours leading up to expiration. While Bitcoin's market positioning appears cautious, Ethereum's bullish momentum could lead to increased volatility and potential upside moves, especially if the overall market sentiment remains positive.

2025-06-19T15:52:04,"Citing Bitcoin Dominance, Analyst Says There Will Be No Altcoin Season: Here’s Why","As long as the Bitcoin dominance stays above the Bull Market Support Band, there will be no altcoin season, an analyst has suggested. Bitcoin's price recently experienced a slight uptick, trading around $104,800 amid a modest increase of about 0.5%. This price movement followed a brief decline to $103,600, which was quickly reversed by bullish action, pushing Bitcoin back toward the $105K mark. This price action comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates unchanged. Despite these market shifts, an analyst on X, Luca, emphasized that Bitcoin’s dominance will remain strong. A significant technical feature of this chart is the Bull Market Support Band, which consists of two key moving averages: a 20-week simple moving average and a 21-week exponential moving average. The space between these moving averages forms a critical support band, which Bitcoin’s dominance has consistently remained above.This suggests that Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins, and an altcoin season, or a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin, appears unlikely in the near term.BMSB Acting as SupportThe Bitcoin Dominance chart illustrates several instances where the BMSB acted as a support level, preventing a fall in dominance. For example, Bitcoin’s dominance decreased from approximately 56.2% in June 2024 to 54.44% in July of that year, but the BMSB held firm, signaling continued strength for Bitcoin. Similarly, another decline from 59% to 56.61% occurred in late December 2024 into January 2025, but again, the support band kept dominance from falling further.Most recently, Bitcoin dominance was supported at 61.93% on May 14, down from 65.4% on May 7. It has, however, recovered to 64.9% during this period.There Will Be No Altcoin Season Notably, the Bitcoin Dominance chart also shows a period where the asset’s dominance dipped below the Bull Market Support Band. The instance occurred in early December, when Bitcoin's dominance dropped to about 54.6%. However, this decline was short-lived, as dominance quickly recovered and reached 59% by December 20. While this brief deviation indicated a temporary weakening of Bitcoin’s market position, it was not enough to signal a broader trend toward altcoin dominance.Luca believes that as long as Bitcoin Dominance remains above its Bull Market Support Band, an altcoin season will not occur.Luca also shared a separate 12-hour chart, stating that as long as Bitcoin's dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there are no risks of the current movement being a distribution range for BTC.https://twitter.com/CrypticTrades_/status/1935650012869873922Analyst Views on Future Bitcoin Dominance and Altcoin TrendsOther analysts have weighed in on Bitcoin dominance, presenting differing views on its future trajectory. Bitcoinsensus suggests that the dominance could ""fall off a cliff"" soon, though a slight dip may occur before a potential altcoin season. The analyst highlights that Bitcoin's dominance has been on an uptrend for over four years and may continue to rise, possibly reaching 70% before collapsing to usher in the altcoin season. Meanwhile, Dariusz Kowalczyk points out that Bitcoin’s dominance is showing signs of a potential double top pattern. If Bitcoin fails to break through resistance, altcoins could see a capital rotation. However, if dominance surpasses resistance, Bitcoin may be on track for a new all-time high.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/19/citing-bitcoin-dominance-analyst-insists-there-will-be-no-altcoin-season-heres-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=citing-bitcoin-dominance-analyst-insists-there-will-be-no-altcoin-season-heres-why,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T15:51:30,"Altcoins today: RAY and MNT soar up to 35% as Ethereum holds $2,500","Cryptocurrencies are performing relatively well amid soaring geopolitical tensions . Most tokens have held their crucial price levels as Bitcoin trades range-bound within the $105,000 vicinity. Altcoins saw mixed movements in the last 24 hours, with many signaling potential momentum shifts to bullish. Ethereum holds above its key support of $2,500, while Raydium and Mantle stole the show with substantial gains over the past day. Ethereum holds $2,500 amid institutional inflows The largest altcoin by market cap has remained resilient as the crypto industry ignored the Israel-Iran conflict. ETH trades at $2,534 at press time, and the shifting sentiments indicate imminent recoveries. However, institutional accumulation suggests investor confidence in Ethereum’s performance. SoSoValue data shows US ETH spot exchange-traded funds have seen a single red day in the past ten days. Source – SoSoValue Maintaining the prevailing bullishness could see the token soaring to the nearest resistance at $2,699. Bulls should push Ethereum above this level to shift its short-term outlook to bullish. Nevertheless, losing grounds at $2,500 would trigger notable dips to the reliable support zone at $2,395. Weakness at this foothold might open the path to the psychological mark of $2,000. RAY skyrockets on Upbit listing Raydium dominated crypto trends on Thursday following its sharp jump to an intraday high of $2.6279. It has gained approximately 35% since yesterday. RAY was trading at $2.22 after brief corrections from its daily peak. Chart by Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by over 600%, indicating renewed trader interest in the altcoin. The bullish momentum emerged after South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit, confirmed listing Raydium’s USDT and KRW trading pairs. However, the question remains. Can Raydium sustain the prevailing rally and switch it to long-term gains? The token exhibits massive volatility, calling for caution. Further, the latest rebound comes after an extended struggle, with RAY lowering about 30% of its value the previous month. While it can stretch its current upside, the alt remains poised for notable declines once the “Upbit optimism” diminishes. However, reclaiming the vital region between $2.60 and $2.70 could trigger substantial gains to the resistance at $3.5. MNT soars as Mantle launches UR crypto bank Mantle’s native token joined the upside party, climbing from the $0.5591 low to $0.6305 at press time. Chart by Coinmarketcap That translates to a 15% increase since yesterday. News of Mantle launching UR , a crypto-first digital bank, kick-started MNT’s rally. UR is a borderless crypto neobank that aims to bridge traditional finance with DeFi by allowing users to save, spend, and more in one account. MNT exhibits robust bullishness amidst the impressive ecosystem developments. The altcoin will likely extend its rally before possible declines. Nevertheless, trading volumes remain weak, with only a 4% increase in the past day. MNT needs surged trading volumes to sustain its current rally.

2025-06-19T15:37:21,"Keiser Says Only Bitcoin Matters, Slams US Politicians Over Involvement in “Shitcoins”","Max Keiser, a notable Bitcoin advocate, rebuked U.S. political leaders for promoting what he considers harmful crypto assets. In an X post today, Keiser, who serves as adviser to El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele on Bitcoin matters, shared an image of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work mining infrastructure alongside flag-draped military coffins, which he captioned as ""Proof of War."" Bitcoin Maxi Keiser Slams US Politicians Specifically, he used the image to argue that American politicians have sacrificed integrity and national security in favor of opportunistic businesses related to crypto assets besides Bitcoin, or ""shitcoins,"" as he described them.Keiser asserted that if U.S. lawmakers concentrated exclusively on Bitcoin rather than supporting a broad range of unstable tokens, the country might avoid ""the image on the right,"" referring to the war casualties. Max Keiser on X The Bitcoin maximalist warned that prioritizing quick profits through ""shitcoins"" trades human lives for short-term gain. However, it remains unclear if he meant this literally or if the second image was merely a metaphor for some other form of damage.Coincidentally, Keiser's recent remarks align with a moment of rising tension, as the U.S. faces pressure during the ongoing Israel-Iran war. As a close ally of Israel, the U.S. now draws increasing attention from geopolitical analysts, who question whether it will take direct action in the conflict.Trump's Crypto InvolvementsAlso, the comments land amid a wave of crypto-related controversies surrounding President Donald Trump and his family. Since his re-election in November 2024, Trump has doubled down on digital assets through policy and business involvement. One of the most notable endeavors is the World Liberty Financial (WLF) DeFi platform, which launched in October 2024. Dubbed a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, WLF designates Trump as its ""Chief Crypto Advocate."" His sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron serve as Web3 ambassadors. The platform raised $550 million by March 2025 through its governance token, WLFI, and surpassed $1 billion in total sales by January 20.Notably, a Delaware-based entity tied to the Trump family holds more than 22 billion WLFI tokens, valued at launch around $337.5 million. The same entity also receives the majority of protocol revenue. In March 2025, WLF also introduced a stablecoin, USD1.Controversies have followed these developments. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and legal experts, argue that Trump's roles as president and crypto entrepreneur raise red flags about conflicts of interest. The TRUMP Memecoin and Other InvolvementsMeanwhile, Trump's crypto portfolio expanded further in January 2025 with the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin. The coin's value skyrocketed and later crashed, leaving over 800,000 wallets with losses exceeding $2 billion, while Trump-affiliated entities reportedly earned $100 million in trading fees. On May 22, Trump hosted an exclusive dinner for top $TRUMP holders, an event some lawmakers described as veiled political fundraising.First Lady Melania Trump followed suit by launching her own token, $MELANIA, on Jan. 19. It quickly surpassed $1 billion in market cap, although it too faced criticism for being speculative and lacking utility.Despite these involvements, Trump has made official moves to support Bitcoin directly. In March, he signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, although Bitcoin maxis criticized the President for also creating an altcoin stockpile.His sons also announced a family investment in American Bitcoin, a mining venture where Eric Trump serves as Chief Strategy Officer. Trump's media company, TMTG, recently disclosed plans to invest $2.5 billion in Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/19/keiser-says-only-bitcoin-matters-slams-us-politicians-over-involvement-in-shitcoins/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=keiser-says-only-bitcoin-matters-slams-us-politicians-over-involvement-in-shitcoins,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
