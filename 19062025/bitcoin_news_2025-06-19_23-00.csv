According to data from on-chain analysis platforms, the value of these sales is around $12.15 million. Since March 16, the project has transferred a total of 76.132 million MELANIA tokens from community and liquidity addresses to various wallets. Then, sales were carried out using unilateral liquidity addition and DCA methods. During this process, the project sold MELANIA tokens for 244,000 SOL, raising approximately $35.218 million.

NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef explains why. Rising tensions in the Middle East are exposing a flaw in how some traders view Bitcoin (BTC) . Instead of acting as a hedge, Bitcoin is behaving more like a tech stock, says Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, a crypto peer-to-peer payments and trading platform. “Markets usually don’t like surprises — but lately, crypto doesn’t seem to react much. Over the past week, we’ve seen a major hack targeting Iran’s biggest crypto exchange, growing tensions in the Middle East, and even signs of digital warfare. Yet crypto prices have barely moved,” Ray Yossef, NoOnes. Yossef also highlighted the $100 million breach of Nobitex, Iran’s biggest crypto exchange. The hack, likely performed by Predatory Sparrow, a hacking group with ties to Israel , would have sounded alarm bells earlier. You might also like: Iran imposes curfew on crypto exchanges following Nobitex hack Escalating tensions are usually positive for hedge assets. However, Bitcoin’s reaction was muted, continuing to trade around $105,000. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) also traded between $2,120 and $2,330, now for the seventh week in a row. This is despite significant whale inflows , amounting to 871,000 ETH over one week. Bitcoin fails as a hedge asset for now: Yossef Bitcoin’s lack of movement, according to Youssef, suggests that its hedge-asset narrative is losing traction in today’s market. Bitcoin no longer appears to function as a hedge asset; instead, it behaves more like a high-beta tech stock, caught in the macro winds but not really steering its own ship. The link between BTC and the Nasdaq 100 is still strong at 0.68,” Ray Yossef, NoOnes. Still, Youssef notes that geopolitical risk is driving a shift within the broader crypto landscape. Bitcoin dominance is approaching 66%, as traders retreat from riskier altcoins. If global tensions continue to mount, this rotation into BTC could accelerate, especially if capital controls, sanctions, and infrastructure disruptions enter the mix.

2025-06-19T20:20:37,"Urgent Crypto Alert: ETH/BTC Ratio Stalls, Delaying Altcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Urgent Crypto Alert: ETH/BTC Ratio Stalls, Delaying Altcoin Season Are you waiting for the next big move in the crypto market? Many investors are eagerly anticipating the start of ‘altcoin season’ – that exciting period when smaller cryptocurrencies surge in value, often outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a key indicator, the ETH/BTC ratio , is currently sending a cautious signal that suggests this anticipated rally might be delayed. What the Stagnant ETH/BTC Ratio Tells Us The ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial metric in the cryptocurrency world. It measures the value of one Ethereum (ETH) relative to one Bitcoin (BTC). Think of it as a barometer for investor sentiment towards Ethereum compared to the market leader, Bitcoin. When the ratio rises, it typically means ETH is performing better than BTC, indicating stronger interest in Ethereum and often, a willingness to take on more risk by investing in altcoins. Conversely, a falling or stagnant ratio suggests ETH is underperforming or simply keeping pace with BTC, which can point to weaker confidence in altcoins. According to analysis highlighted by BeInCrypto, the ETH/BTC ratio has been trading within a remarkably narrow range since mid-May. This lack of significant movement reflects a hesitant attitude from investors towards Ethereum. Why is this important? Because Ethereum is the largest altcoin by market cap, its performance relative to Bitcoin is often seen as a precursor or catalyst for broader altcoin rallies. If ETH isn’t showing strength against BTC, it’s less likely that smaller altcoins will find the momentum needed for a widespread ‘altcoin season’. Analyst Insight: The Critical 0.024 Level Prominent analyst Crypto Fella recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to emphasize the significance of the current ETH/BTC ratio chart. The pair is currently hovering precariously close to the 0.024 level. This isn’t just a random number; it holds historical importance. This level marked previous cycle bottoms for the ETH/BTC ratio in 2019 and 2020. Following those instances, Ethereum saw strong rebounds against Bitcoin, which helped pave the way for significant altcoin market rallies. Here’s a simplified look at the significance: 0.024 Level: Historically a strong support zone for the ETH/BTC ratio. Previous Cycles (2019, 2020): Bouncing off this level preceded strong ETH performance and subsequent altcoin runs. Current Situation: The ratio is testing this level, but without a clear rebound signal yet. The analyst’s caution lies in the fact that while the ratio is near a historically significant support, there hasn’t been a decisive show of strength or a clear bullish reversal signal yet. Simply touching the level isn’t enough; a strong bounce is needed to indicate renewed investor confidence in Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Why a Stagnant Ratio Delays Altcoin Season The connection between the ETH/BTC ratio and ‘altcoin season’ is fundamental to understanding the current crypto market outlook . Bitcoin typically leads market cycles. As confidence grows, investors first move into Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin has made significant gains and perhaps consolidates, capital often flows into Ethereum, the second-largest and most established cryptocurrency with a vast ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). If Ethereum starts performing strongly against Bitcoin (the ratio rises), it signals increasing risk appetite in the market. This is the point where investors often start looking further down the market cap list, seeking higher potential returns in smaller altcoins. Therefore, if the ETH/BTC ratio remains stuck or weakens, that capital rotation from BTC to ETH, and subsequently into smaller altcoins, is stalled. The current stagnation suggests that capital is either staying primarily in Bitcoin or is on the sidelines, rather than aggressively flowing into Ethereum and other altcoins. This subdued activity in ETH relative to BTC directly impacts the potential for a broad-based altcoin rally. What to Watch For: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market For those invested in or considering investing in altcoins, monitoring the ETH/BTC ratio is crucial. Here are some actionable insights based on the current situation and the analyst’s observations: Watch the 0.024 Level: Observe how the ETH/BTC ratio behaves around this historical support. A strong bounce and sustained move above this level would be a positive sign. Look for a Clear Show of Strength: This means not just a small uptick, but a noticeable, multi-day or weekly rally in the ETH/BTC chart. Increased volume accompanying the move would add conviction. Monitor Ethereum Price Action: Independently of the ratio, observe the Ethereum price against USD. Strong bullish momentum here, especially if it starts outpacing Bitcoin price gains, would reinforce the potential for a ratio increase. Monitor Bitcoin Price Action: While the ratio is key, the overall crypto market outlook is heavily influenced by Bitcoin. If Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn, it’s likely to drag the entire market, including ETH and altcoins, down, regardless of the ratio’s position. Stability or continued upward movement in BTC is generally supportive. Assess Overall Market Sentiment: Are headlines bullish or bearish? Is there increased retail interest? These broader factors also play a role. Until the ETH/BTC ratio shows a convincing rebound from current levels, the analyst’s view suggests that the anticipated ‘altcoin season’ remains on hold. This period of stagnation could continue until a clear catalyst emerges to drive significant capital back into Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Challenges and Potential Outcomes The primary challenge is the lack of clear direction. Will the 0.024 level hold as support, leading to a bounce and potentially reigniting ‘altcoin season’? Or will it break, signaling further weakness for ETH relative to BTC and potentially a longer delay or even a significant downturn for altcoins? Scenario 1 (Bullish for Altcoins): The ETH/BTC ratio finds strong support at or near 0.024, bounces convincingly, and starts trending upwards. This would likely precede or coincide with a renewed rally in Ethereum price and a subsequent flow of capital into smaller altcoins, triggering the long-awaited ‘altcoin season’. Scenario 2 (Bearish for Altcoins): The ETH/BTC ratio breaks below the 0.024 level and continues to fall. This would indicate significant underperformance of ETH against BTC, likely due to weaker confidence or capital rotation primarily into Bitcoin or out of the market altogether. This scenario would be detrimental to altcoins, potentially leading to significant price drops. Scenario 3 (Continued Stagnation): The ratio continues to trade in a tight range around 0.024. This implies ongoing indecision and weak conviction, keeping ‘altcoin season’ on pause. While not immediately bearish, prolonged stagnation can lead to investor fatigue. Understanding these potential outcomes helps investors manage expectations and risks within the current crypto market outlook . Conclusion: Patience is Key in the Current Crypto Market Outlook The message from the ETH/BTC ratio is clear: the market is currently favoring Bitcoin or sitting on the sidelines, and a widespread ‘altcoin season’ is unlikely to kick off until Ethereum demonstrates clear strength relative to the market leader. The 0.024 level is a critical watchpoint, but a simple touch isn’t enough – a convincing rebound is needed. While the delay might be frustrating for altcoin holders, it also provides an opportunity for observation and strategic planning. Monitoring the key indicators discussed, particularly the ETH/BTC ratio and the price action of both Ethereum price and Bitcoin price , is essential for navigating the current crypto market outlook and positioning yourself for when the market dynamics eventually shift.

2025-06-19T20:19:08,"Analysis Company Releases Critical Weekly Report on Bitcoin – Is BTC Healthy in the Current Situation?","Cryptocurrency analysis company Glassnode has evaluated the current state of Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market in its latest report. The report noted that while the number of transactions on the network has decreased, the total amount of value moved has increased. This situation reveals that especially large investors and companies are becoming increasingly dominant in on-chain activities. Glassnode reminded that the number of daily transactions on the Bitcoin network showed an upward trend in 2023 and 2024 and reached a peak of 734 thousand transactions. However, this number has decreased significantly since the beginning of 2025. The number of daily transactions currently ranges between 320 thousand and 500 thousand. Despite this, the economic value carried on the Bitcoin network continues to remain at very high levels. While the annual average daily transfer of $ 7.5 billion was made, this value reached $ 16 billion when the record of $ 100 thousand was broken in November 2024. The average volume of each transaction is currently around $36,200. This shows that although the number of transactions is decreasing, each transaction still contains a significant amount of value. This trend shows that the Bitcoin network is used more for high-value transfers and that individual users are relatively decreasing. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” The report stated that the share of transactions over $100,000 in the total transaction volume on the network was 66% in November 2022, and this rate has reached 89% today. This statistic clearly shows that the weight of institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals in on-chain activities has increased over time. Despite Bitcoin being just 6% away from its all-time high of $111,700, transaction fees remain low and demand for block space remains weak. While periods of high prices in previous cycles were often accompanied by increased network congestion and transaction fees, this cycle is seeing a clear divergence. Glassnode says the main reason for this is the shift of activity to off-chain platforms. Centralized exchanges (CEX) in particular currently account for the majority of cryptocurrency trading volume, with spot, futures, and options trading collectively exceeding on-chain trading by 7 to 16 times. This suggests that the majority of investors are now opting for centralized platforms over on-chain. Another noteworthy point in the report is that the total value of open positions in the futures and options markets has reached $96.2 billion. This shows that the amount of leveraged transactions in the market has increased. However, as a pleasing development, it is stated that the collateral used in open positions has become healthier. It is emphasized that positions collateralized by stablecoins in particular now constitute the majority. *This is not investment advice.

Elon Musk’s X Advances Its Super App Vision Ultimately, the new feature will let users trade and invest directly in the X app. This change makes the app a single place for both content and financial services. It is worth noting that the launch will start in the United States with a new brand called X Money. Meanwhile, this new initiative expands X’s digital payments and financial technology efforts. Musk wants to change how people use financial tools by directly adding stock trading, crypto investing, and digital payments into the platform. The new X Money wallet will support regular cash transactions, peer-to-peer payments, and possibly digital assets, making it more versatile than current apps. Elon Musk X Removes Bitcoin and Crypto Hashtag Last year, Elon Musk’s X removed the Bitcoin hashtag emoji , sparking diverse reactions from the cryptocurrency community. This decision is part of a broader update by the platform, which has eliminated all hashtag emojis, not just the one associated with Bitcoin. The removal, however, was not publicly announced, leaving users speculating about the reasons behind this apparent change. Some users are disappointed, as they felt the emojis brought a unique and enjoyable aspect to their social media interactions. On the other hand, some users think that X might be removing the feature to clean up the platform and reduce clutter. Others speculate that this decision could be influenced by changing regulations and X’s need to remain neutral about cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk Building an Everything App Meanwhile, the enigmatic boss revealed his intention to stop using his phone number and instead use the X app for texts and audio/video calls. Under Musk’s leadership, this recent addition is part of a series of improvements to the platform’s core experience. Following his acquisition of the social media company, Musk indicated his plans to turn the platform into a super-app . He also plans to provide several services, including messaging, social networking, and peer-to-peer payments. Furthermore, Musk plans to take out traditional banks. He envisions that X will cover all aspects of a person’s financial life, from money to securities, thereby mitigating the need for traditional banks.

2025-06-19T20:03:09,"Despite All the Recent Developments, Bitcoin Remains Above $100,000 – What Does This Mean, and What’s Next for BTC?","Bitcoin has managed to stay above the $100,000 level for more than five weeks amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, with analysts arguing that the level has become a permanent floor price rather than a “psychological support” in investors’ minds. Elliot Johnson, CEO of the newly established Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, noted that Bitcoin has remained resilient, especially despite the Israel-Iran tensions and the relatively hawkish stance of the Fed announced this week. Johnson said, “Bitcoin has remained incredibly resilient in recent weeks,” emphasizing that the $100,000 level is now “firmly established.” The FED kept interest rates steady yesterday, but the updated dot plot predicts only one rate cut in 2025. This is less dovish than the market expected. Analysts say this stance could extend the sideways trend in stock and bond markets. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” Johnson also noted that Bitcoin has strengthened its position not only as a safe haven, but also as an alternative asset to the depreciating US dollar and a long-term treasury reserve. His founder, Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, aims to help institutional companies adopt Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. One of the strongest examples of institutional demand was MicroStrategy, which bought $1.05 billion worth of new BTC last week. The company’s founder, Michael Saylor, is the largest investor in Bitcoin. Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, also said that markets have generally entered a “wait-and-see” mode. Drawing attention to the stagnant course in oil, gold, the S&P 500 and the dollar index, Puckrin said, “But Bitcoin is disrupting this course. $100,000 is no longer just a support level, it is settling in investors’ minds as a base price.” According to Puckrin, there are also macroeconomic headwinds behind this resilient stance. While two interest rate cuts are still expected for 2025, signals from the Bank of Japan that it will ease monetary tightening in 2026 also suggest that liquidity could increase again. In this scenario, Bitcoin is expected to be the biggest gainer, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-19T20:00:05,"Analytics Firm Glassnode Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says Retail Participation Softening and Demand Slowing","Crypto analytics platform Glassnode says the Bitcoin ( BTC ) market has entered a “cooling phase” after the price of the flagship digital asset failed to consolidate above the $111,000 level. According to Glassnode, the market is witnessing “softening retail participation and a retreat from aggressive buying” amid the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), a technical indicator, turning bearish. The Spot CVD is used to determine the buying and selling pressure in the spot market in real-time, with a rise indicating bullish sentiment while a fall suggests a bearish sentiment. Explains Glassnode, “Spot market signals weakened across the board, momentum fell back toward neutral, spot CVD turned sharply negative, and volume dipped below the statistical low band… …the sharp reversal in perpetual CVD suggests short-term traders may be trimming risk.” While there was a sharp rise in inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Glassnode says there was subdued organic on-chain activity as evidenced by falling fees, no growth in active addresses and only a moderate transfer volume. “ETF flows rose sharply, reaffirming institutional demand, though trade volume declined, showing more passive accumulation than active trading.” According to Glassnode, close to 97% of the Bitcoin supply is currently sitting at a profit, and this presents a risk of a sell-off if the demand for the crypto king remains subdued. “Without renewed demand from both retail and institutional investors, the current cooling momentum may persist.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,457 at time of writing, down by around 7% from the all-time high price of $111,800.

The Trump Coin price may be gearing up for a revival, as early bullish signals emerge on lower time frames during a retest of a falling wedge pattern forming since late April. TRUMP / USDT 4-hour chart, falling wedge retest. Source: TradingView, Binance. The RSI has made a sharp rebound to 32 after reaching deep oversold territory at 25—often a signal that buyers stepping in as sellers reach their point of exhaustion. More so, the MACD line is nearing a golden cross above the signal line, a classic bullish reversal pattern that typically precedes a short-term uptrend on the 4-hour timeframe. The TRUMP coin price is currently testing key support around $9.30—where the wedge’s lower boundary meets a historical price floor and the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. A successful reversal from this confluence zone could trigger a move toward the upper trendline of the wedge, putting the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $10.70 in focus as a breakout zone. If bulls gain control and a breakout follows, the falling wedge structure sets up a technical target of $16.50—a potential 77% move back to late-May highs. Still, if $9.30 fails to hold, the next support rests at $7.15, around 22% below current levels, aligning with the mid-April market bottom and invalidating the bullish setup. While Altcoins Struggle, Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability.

2025-06-19T19:55:01,"Bitcoin Reclaiming This Critical Resistance Level Would Be a Big Signal for the Next Leg Up, Says Analyst Michaël van de Poppe","A widely followed crypto analyst is identifying the key resistance level Bitcoin ( BTC ) needs to reclaim to make its next big move to the upside. In a new thread, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,600 followers on the social media platform X that if the crypto king can reclaim the $106,000 level, it would signal its next big leg up. “Update on Bitcoin: It has taken the liquidity and bounced back upwards. What’s next? Ideally, I’d like to see $106,000 break back up and hold. That would be the big signal for the next bull market leg.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe goes on to say that he expects the top crypto asset by market cap to test the $106,000 level “in the coming days” while noting that the Fed’s latest meeting was a whiff. “FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) show is over, which was a nothing burger, means that we’re back into the normal trading game for Bitcoin. I suppose we’ll see a test of $106,000 and breakout north in the coming days. Altcoins are, again, outperforming.” Concluding his analysis with Ethereum ( ETH ), Van de Poppe says it appears the market is ready to rotate into the second-largest digital asset by market cap and other altcoins, as ETH didn’t see much movement when BTC was consolidating last. “A pretty strong signal that ETH consolidates on these levels and didn’t move while Bitcoin was consolidating. That’s a strong signal that the market sentiment and momentum is rotating towards Ethereum and Altcoins.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $104,236 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours. Ethereum is valued at $2,497, also a marginal increase on the day.

Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserves have been a major trend in the past few months. However, Ethereum (ETH) is slowly catching up. On June 19, strategic reserves among institutions rose to 1.190 million ETH , according to the Strategic ETH Reserve website. These reserves, worth almost $3 billion, amount to more than 1% of the total supply of ETH. The growth of ETH strategic reserves | Source: Strategic ETH Reserve Top holders dominate these reserves, with the five largest entities controlling over 70% of all institutional ETH holdings. The Ethereum Foundation is the single largest holder, with 269,431 ETH. It’s followed by SharpLink, a Nasdaq-listed gaming company that acquired 176,271 ETH on June 13 and has staked 95% of it. The Nasdaq-listed firm acquired its reserves on June 13 and is staking 95% of the ETH. The most recent entrant is Status, an Ethereum messenger and Wallet, which acquired 23,066 ETH on June 19, worth $2.9 million. Entities holding the most Ethereum strategic reserves | Source: Strategic ETH Reserve Other significant holders include layer-1 network PulseChain, crypto exchange Coinbase, and the Ethereum-focused Golem Foundation.

As the most established altcoin, it is emerging as the top choice beyond Bitcoin. Among them, Michigan’s state pension plan made a $10 million allocation in Ethereum. Publicly traded companies that hold Ethereum include Bit Digital, BTCS, Intchains Group, and KR1, firms that are mostly focused on crypto assets.

The market is consolidating, but momentum is building. As state-level crypto policies evolve and DeFi integration grows, the foundations for a price breakout are being laid. The circulating supply of BTC is getting close to 19.88M, and scarcity is a bullish driver. However, beyond supply and demand theory, real-world catalysts are providing traders with new reasons to remain long. Ohio Passes $200 Bitcoin Tax Break, Eyes Senate Vote The Ohio House of Representatives has just passed the Blockchain Basics Act (68–26), providing new protections for crypto users and miners. $200 tax exemption on capital gains for crypto transactions Ban on interference with self-custody wallets Mining protection from discriminatory zoning laws If passed by the Senate, Ohio would lead U.S. states in progressive crypto regulation. This clarity is bullish; it reduces friction for adoption and provides a model for others to follow. Ohio's HB 116 advances with unanimous 13-0 vote in the House Tech Committee. It protects self-custody, mining, and introduces a first-in-the-nation #Bitcoin tax exemption on purchases under $200. pic.twitter.com/d7C1D4NcO1 — TFTC (@TFTC21) June 17, 2025 Miners, developers, and retail traders are likely to benefit from the more favorable legal landscape, which could drive Bitcoin demand over time. Kraken Launches Native Bitcoin Staking via Babylon In a notable move for BTCFi (a Bitcoin-based DeFi platform), Kraken has partnered with Babylon Labs to offer native Bitcoin staking, with no wrapping, bridging, or lending required. AND. WE’RE. LIVE It's time to join the Bitcoin Staking Revolution Babylon Testnet, the first ever Trustless Native Bitcoin Staking protocol, is now officially live!

This has several bullish implications: Reduces the circulating BTC supply, providing long-term price support Shows BTC utility beyond store of value Institutional BTCFi participation grows the ecosystem liquidity As more Bitcoin is locked for staking and institutions explore yield strategies, BTC’s role in decentralized finance is maturing rapidly. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Triangle Apex Nears $105K On the 2-hour chart, BTC is coiling within a classic ascending triangle, forming higher lows with horizontal resistance near $105,000. The 50-EMA at $105,252 acts as a dynamic ceiling. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators suggest a breakout may be imminent. Trade setup to watch: Entry: Break above $105,500 with a strong candle Targets: $107,200, then $108,351 Stop-loss: Below trendline at $103,400 MACD: Flat, awaiting confirmation Candlesticks: Multiple doji and spinning tops near resistance Bottom Line: BTC is consolidating at a critical resistance zone, while real-world catalysts, like regulatory clarity and staking innovation, boost confidence. A breakout above $105,500 could trigger a fresh leg higher in Bitcoin’s 2025 bull run. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

2025-06-19T19:00:15,"Messari Shows Why Flare Innovation Is a Game-Changer for XRP","A new report highlighted by Jungle Inc Crypto News and based on insights from blockchain research firm Messari reveals why Flare Network may be the most transformative force XRP has seen in years. Designed as a “blockchain for data,” Flare is solving some of the most pressing challenges in crypto, unlocking true DeFi utility for XRP without compromising on security or decentralization. A Purpose-Built Chain for Data and Interoperability Flare sets itself apart from other Layer-1 networks by focusing on secure, decentralized data access and cross-chain functionality. Its core architecture features the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and Flare Data Connector (FDC). These native tools allow smart contracts to interact with real-time, verifiable data and assets across multiple blockchains, making Flare a uniquely positioned infrastructure layer in the evolving Web3 ecosystem. Messari Just Covered Flare—and It’s a Game-Changer for XRP ""We’ve been tracking Layer-1 innovation closely, but Flare might be the most underestimated DeFi story of the year."" What if XRP could finally go DeFi—without giving up custody, and without relying on centralized… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 19, 2025 FXRP: Non-Custodial XRP for DeFi The introduction of FXRP, a 1:1 representation of XRP on Flare , marks a major breakthrough. Unlike traditional wrapped assets, FXRP is fully non-custodial and enables XRP holders to participate in DeFi—lending, borrowing, farming, and trading—without giving up ownership of their tokens. This innovation is what the community now calls “XRPFi,” and it positions XRP as a first-class citizen in decentralized finance. Rapid Ecosystem Growth and Stablecoin Liquidity Flare’s momentum has accelerated following the integration of USD₮0, an omnichain version of Tether, via LayerZero. In just 13 days, the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) tripled, surpassing $120 million. This surge in liquidity has energized developers and attracted new users, reinforcing Flare’s role as a viable DeFi hub. Beyond XRP: Expanding Access with FAssets Flare’s impact extends beyond XRP. Through the FAsset protocol, Flare is introducing decentralized access to non-smart contract tokens like Bitcoin (FBTC) and Dogecoin (FDOGE). This approach eliminates the need for centralized bridges and opens DeFi to some of the most widely held cryptocurrencies, significantly expanding the addressable market for the Flare ecosystem. Real Economic Testing on Songbird Before any innovation reaches the Flare mainnet, it undergoes real-world stress testing on Songbird, Flare’s canary network. Unlike typical testnets, Songbird uses assets of real value. FXRP was first launched on Songbird, where it hit its testing cap in just four days—demonstrating both demand and technical readiness. Growing Institutional Interest Flare is also capturing the attention of major institutional players. Uphold, which holds approximately 1.8 billion XRP, is actively engaging with the ecosystem. Meanwhile, VivoPower, a global energy company, is preparing to deploy up to $100 million in XRP through Flare’s infrastructure—evidence of the network’s growing institutional credibility. The Future: Liquid Staking with stXRP Next on the roadmap is Firelight, a protocol enabling liquid staking for FXRP. Users will soon be able to stake FXRP and receive stXRP, a yield-bearing, liquid asset that remains usable across DeFi platforms. Similar to Ethereum’s stETH, stXRP could play a key role in capital-efficient yield generation for XRP holders. Infrastructure, Not Just a Bridge Flare is not merely a bridging solution—it’s a comprehensive, data-secure infrastructure play. With decentralized access to DeFi, institutional engagement, and real-world testing baked into its architecture, Flare could be the catalyst that finally brings XRP into the DeFi mainstream.

2025-06-19T19:00:04,"Dogecoin Price Flashes Pattern That Led To Previous Breakouts, Here’s What It Is","The Dogecoin price is once again in the spotlight, as new reports show it mirroring a familiar chart pattern that has historically preceded major breakouts. Analysts have identified this recurring setup, raising speculation that another upward move could be on the horizon for the popular meme coin. Dogecoin Price Mirrors Historic Breakout Setup A Pseudonymous crypto analyst, known as ‘Batman,’ revealed in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is currently forming a distinct pattern, closely resembling setups that preceded previous price breakouts. Based on the 4-hour chart analysis, DOGE has established a strong support level around the $0.175 mark. This zone has now been held twice, forming a recognizable double-top pattern —a formation often viewed as a potential bullish reversal signal. The chart highlights a projected staircase-like rally, marked by upward thrusts followed by smaller corrective movements. Precisely, Dogecoin is anticipated to undergo a four-wave move, suggesting an initial breakout before a subsequent bullish continuation to higher resistance levels. The price is expected to climb toward the $0.2039 target, marking the first resistance level in its bullish trajectory. After reaching this point, a brief pullback is predicted to follow before a stronger rally pushes the price toward the $0.25425 level, which represents the steepest portion of the projected rally. Despite these fluctuations, Dogecoin’s overall bullish structure will remain intact, with the analyst’s chart suggesting that each rally will be followed by a healthy consolidation before the next leg up. Notably, Batman notes that this current chart setup closely mirrors a familiar market behavior observed in Dogecoin’s past price action , where a sharp breakout and a rapid upward move to new highs followed an extended period of sideways trading. With the same bullish pattern now unfolding once more, the analyst now has more reason to believe that Dogecoin may be on the verge of another explosive run . The trajectory of the four-wave pattern in the chart also shows DOGE skyrocketing past $0.26 once its price rebounds from its Wave 4 retracement. DOGE ETF And Whale Activity To Fuel Hype Beyond Batman’s chart, the analyst reveals that broader market sentiment and widespread speculative developments are already aligning with this bullish technical pattern to fuel a potential breakout in the Dogecoin price. While the technical analysis highlights a familiar pattern that has historically preceded major DOGE rallies, this time, the emergence of the setup comes amid increased whale accumulation and growing optimism surrounding the meme coin’s potential integration into Elon Musk’s X payment platform . Although these developments have not been factored into the chart, Batman suggests that they contribute to the bullish narrative surrounding Dogecoin and could serve as potential catalysts for a breakout. Additionally, with the recent crypto ETF filings boosting overall market sentiment, Dogecoin appears to be benefiting from both technical and speculative momentum.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-flashes-pattern/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Batman|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T18:49:11,"Top 3 Projects Dominating Headlines as a New Wave of Political and Corporate Adoption Builds","A new surge of interest in the crypto space is being driven by major shifts in political and corporate spheres. Key projects are emerging as frontrunners, capturing headlines and attracting attention. This article reveals the top three contenders poised for significant growth, offering a glimpse into the future of digital currency adoption. Bitcoin Price Update: Range-Bound Trading with Mixed Trends Bitcoin experienced a slight decline of 4.33% over the past week and a near-flat performance with a drop of 0.94% in the last month, while showing a half-year gain of 7.92%. This short-term pullback contrasts with the overall positive momentum observed in recent months, indicating that selling pressure has not fully erased longer-term gains. Modest fluctuations have characterized recent price action, with minor dips amidst the overall recovery. The numbers reflect a resilient coin, as investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic despite brief setbacks. Bitcoin currently trades within a range between $94,832 and $113,326.80. Immediate support is at $84,880, while resistance is near $121,869.42. Additional support is found at $66,385 and resistance at $140,364. The Awesome Oscillator at -681.90 and Momentum Indicator at -321.30 show a lack of strong bullish momentum, while the RSI at 49.84 indicates a balance between bulls and bears. With no clear trend, traders may look for a breakout above $121,869.42 for bullish opportunities or consider shorting if prices fall below $84,880. Monitoring these levels is essential for timely trading decisions. SOL Price Analysis: Evaluating Trends and Key Levels Solana experienced a decline over the past month with a 14.03% drop and a six-month decrease of 23.16%, while the one-week change reached -9.63%. The trading range stood between $136 and $182, reflecting notable price variability. The coin’s performance indicates a period of downward movement combined with fluctuation in momentum. Solana’s price behavior has shown clear signs of pressure, as seen in the significant percentage changes that signal reduced buying power and an overall bearish sentiment. The current price scenario shows Solana trading between $136 and $182, with immediate resistance at $207.9 and support at $115.84. A secondary resistance is at $253.93, while secondary support is at $69.81. Technical indicators reveal an Awesome Oscillator of -11.948, a Momentum Indicator of -3.38, and an RSI of 43.84, suggesting bears have the upper hand. The market does not signal a clear long-term trend, leaving room for strategic trades as bullish forces attempt to reverse the current downturn. XRP Faces Downtrend with Key Support and Resistance Levels Over the last month, XRP has experienced a significant decline of about 10.6%, while its half-year performance shows a milder drop of approximately 3.0%. Price action fluctuated within a range of $1.95 to $2.53. A one-week decrease close to 5.8% underlined short-term bearish momentum. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator reported negative values, reflecting a lack of buying interest. The relative strength index stayed just below 46, suggesting a slight caution in market activity. These indicators point to a sustained consolidation phase in recent weeks. Currently, XRP is trading under mild pressure. Immediate support is near $1.73, while resistance is noted around $2.88, with a significant upper barrier at $3.45 and lower support at approximately $1.15. Bearish signals dominate from moving averages and oscillators, indicating stronger bear influence. There is no clear upward trend, as prices remain confined within these levels. Traders may consider buying near support for potential rebounds or selling near resistance to secure short-term gains. Monitoring momentum changes around these levels will be crucial for strategic entries and exits. Conclusion BTC , SOL , and XRP are at the forefront as political and corporate interest grows. Each offers unique advantages that attract attention. BTC remains a solid choice for mainstream acceptance. SOL impresses with its rapid transactions and low costs. XRP stands out due to partnerships with financial institutions. This trio is setting new benchmarks in the evolving crypto arena. Attractive features and rising adoption signal a promising future.

2025-06-19T18:45:36,"Top Chinese Bitcoin Mining Companies To Set Up Shop in US To Avoid President Trump’s Tariffs: Report","The three best-selling makers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining machines in the world are reportedly setting up their manufacturing hubs in the US. Reuters reports that Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, the Chinese firms behind over 90% of the global mining rigs that produce Bitcoin, are establishing their US bases to avoid the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Bitmain, the largest of the three by sales, started producing US mining rigs in December as a strategic move following Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. Canaan began its trial production in the US following the announcement of the so-called Liberation Day levies as an exploratory initiative to avoid import duties. The third-ranked MicroBT says it is actively implementing a localization strategy to avoid the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, the US-based Bitcoin mining startup Auradine is pushing to restrict Chinese hardware supplies to boost competition. The firm’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, says that while over 30% of Bitcoin mining takes place in North America, more than 90% of the mining hardware comes from China, which represents a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply. Gupta says thousands of Chinese mining rigs are also connected to the US electrical grids, which he says poses a security risk, but Canaan senior executive Leo Wang says the mining rigs do not threaten security because they are useless if not applied to Bitcoin mining.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious.

2025-06-19T18:40:04,"Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study The intersection of energy policy and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency mining is a hot topic globally. In France, a recent development has put a spotlight on this complex relationship, specifically concerning the potential use of the nation’s surplus energy. However, the path forward for exploring this idea seems to have hit a roadblock, at least for now. What Happened with French Energy Policy and Bitcoin Mining? Recent reports from Bitcoin.com News highlight a significant decision made by the French National Assembly. Lawmakers there chose not to move forward with a proposal that would have initiated a study into whether Bitcoin mining could serve as an outlet for the country’s excess energy. This wasn’t a vote on actually *using* energy for mining, but merely on whether to conduct a feasibility study. The proposed amendment, which aimed simply to explore the concept, was reportedly dismissed on procedural grounds. This means the idea didn’t even get a full debate on its potential merits or drawbacks within the assembly. The decision effectively shut down the immediate possibility of a formal governmental exploration into this specific use case for surplus energy. This development is particularly noteworthy given France’s unique energy landscape, which is heavily reliant on nuclear power, providing a stable base load that can sometimes lead to periods of excess generation, especially during low demand periods or when renewable sources are producing strongly. Why Consider Bitcoin Mining for Excess Energy? The idea of using excess energy for Bitcoin mining isn’t new globally. It stems from the fundamental nature of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires significant computational power and, consequently, energy. While often criticized for its energy consumption, proponents argue that directing energy that would otherwise be wasted or curtailed towards a productive economic activity like mining offers several potential benefits: Monetizing Waste: Energy grids sometimes produce more power than is immediately needed, particularly from inflexible sources like nuclear or intermittent renewables during peak generation times and low demand. This excess energy can be difficult or costly to store or transmit. Bitcoin mining provides a flexible, interruptible load that can consume this energy, turning a potential liability (wasted energy) into an asset (mined Bitcoin). Grid Stability: Mining operations can potentially act as a form of demand response. They can be powered up quickly when excess energy is available and powered down when the grid needs that power elsewhere, helping to balance supply and demand. This is particularly relevant for managing the variability introduced by growing sources of renewable energy. Funding Renewable Projects: In regions with significant renewable energy production (like hydro, solar, or wind), excess generation is sometimes curtailed (shut down) because the grid cannot absorb it all. Co-locating Bitcoin mining facilities with these projects allows the excess renewable energy to be used on-site, improving the economics of the renewable project and potentially incentivizing further development of sustainable energy infrastructure. Economic Opportunity: Utilizing domestically produced excess energy for mining keeps the economic value generated (the mined Bitcoin) within the country, potentially creating jobs and tax revenue. Decentralized Infrastructure: Bitcoin mining contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network, which some view as a strategic advantage. The amendment proposed in France aimed to study these possibilities, exploring the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility within the specific context of the French grid and its energy mix. The procedural dismissal means these potential benefits, at least from a governmental perspective, remain unexamined. What Are the Concerns and Why the Dismissal? While the amendment was dismissed procedurally, preventing a full debate on the merits, there are underlying concerns often raised about Bitcoin mining that likely contribute to such hesitations and regulatory stances, including aspects related to cryptocurrency regulation France might consider in the future. Potential reasons for the resistance or underlying concerns could include: Public Perception and Environmental Concerns: Despite the focus on *excess* energy, Bitcoin mining still carries a public image of being energy-intensive. Lawmakers might be wary of associating a national energy strategy, even for surplus power, with an activity perceived by some as environmentally damaging. Understanding the Technology: The complexities of Bitcoin mining and its potential integration with grid management might not be fully understood by all policymakers, leading to caution or skepticism. Focus on Other Priorities: French energy policy has numerous pressing challenges, including maintaining nuclear infrastructure, developing renewables, ensuring energy security, and managing energy costs for citizens. Exploring a novel use case like Bitcoin mining for excess energy might be seen as a low priority compared to these more traditional concerns. Procedural Hurdles: The specific reason for the procedural dismissal isn’t detailed in the source, but it could relate to how the amendment was drafted, its timing, or its relevance to the specific bill it was attached to. Sometimes, good ideas get sidelined due to parliamentary procedures rather than outright opposition to the concept itself. Regulatory Uncertainty: The broader landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in France and the EU is still evolving. Integrating a decentralized, global activity like Bitcoin mining into national energy infrastructure might raise complex regulatory questions that lawmakers are not yet prepared to address. The lack of a formal study means these concerns, as well as the potential benefits, were not publicly debated or analyzed by the National Assembly. This leaves the door open for continued speculation and debate outside of the official governmental process. French Energy Policy Context: A Quick Look To understand the context of this decision, it’s important to touch upon the specifics of French energy policy. France has historically relied heavily on nuclear power, which provides a large, stable baseload of electricity. This is complemented by hydroelectric power, and increasingly, by solar and wind energy. The nature of nuclear power means it’s not easily ramped up or down in response to short-term demand fluctuations. This can lead to situations where generation exceeds demand, particularly during off-peak hours or mild weather. Furthermore, the growth of intermittent renewables like solar and wind can also create periods of surplus energy generation, especially when windy or sunny conditions coincide with low demand. Managing this variability and utilizing or storing this excess energy efficiently is a key challenge for grid operators everywhere, including France. The amendment likely sought to investigate if Bitcoin mining could be a part of the solution for managing these specific types of surplus energy situations, acting as a flexible load that could be curtailed when the energy is needed elsewhere or when prices rise. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Regulation in France? While this specific decision was about energy use and not direct cryptocurrency regulation France, it reflects a cautious approach by lawmakers towards integrating novel crypto-related activities into established national infrastructure and policy areas. The procedural dismissal suggests either a lack of political will to delve into the topic at this time, or perhaps indicates that the legislative path chosen for the amendment was not the appropriate one. It doesn’t necessarily signal outright hostility towards Bitcoin or crypto, but rather a reluctance to formally explore its potential role in a critical sector like energy without, perhaps, more public pressure, better understanding, or a different political climate. Future discussions around cryptocurrency regulation in France might still touch upon the energy footprint of crypto activities, but this specific avenue for potentially utilizing surplus power has been put on hold. Sustainable Energy and Bitcoin: An Ongoing Debate The debate around Bitcoin’s energy consumption and its relationship with sustainable energy sources is far from settled. Proponents argue that Bitcoin mining can actually *support* the development of renewable energy by providing a ready buyer for otherwise curtailed or stranded power. Critics remain concerned about the overall scale of energy use and the potential for mining to incentivize the use of fossil fuels in other contexts. The French proposal to study using excess energy fits squarely into this debate. It represents an attempt to explore a pathway where Bitcoin mining could be aligned with energy efficiency and sustainability goals, by consuming energy that would otherwise go to waste. The rejection of this study means France is not currently exploring this specific alignment at a governmental level, leaving potential opportunities on the table according to proponents, or avoiding a potentially controversial association according to critics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next? The procedural dismissal of the amendment doesn’t mean the conversation is over. The topic of energy use by cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin mining, is likely to remain a subject of discussion in policy circles, especially as France and the EU continue to grapple with energy security, climate goals, and digital innovation. Future developments could include: Industry-Led Initiatives: The private sector in France might still explore opportunities to use excess energy for mining, perhaps through direct agreements with energy producers or grid operators, independent of governmental studies. Renewed Legislative Efforts: Proponents of the idea could attempt to introduce similar proposals again in the future, perhaps with different phrasing, timing, or attached to different legislation. Broader EU Discussions: Energy and cryptocurrency regulation are often discussed at the EU level. Developments in other member states or directives from Brussels could influence France’s approach. Increased Public and Political Education: A clearer understanding of how Bitcoin mining can be used for grid balancing or consuming otherwise wasted energy might shift perspectives over time. For now, the formal exploration of using France’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is paused, a result of procedural hurdles rather than a deep dive into the potential benefits and challenges. Summary: A Missed Opportunity for Study? The decision by the French National Assembly to dismiss an amendment proposing a study on using the nation’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is a notable event in the ongoing global discussion about cryptocurrency’s energy footprint and its potential integration with energy grids. While the dismissal was procedural, it effectively halts official exploration into a concept that proponents argue could offer significant benefits for French energy policy, grid stability, and the monetization of otherwise wasted power. The lack of a formal study leaves the potential advantages, as well as the legitimate concerns regarding environmental perception and technical integration, undiscussed at the governmental level. As France navigates its energy future and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation France, the question of how best to utilize its excess energy, and whether activities like Bitcoin mining could play a role in promoting sustainable energy goals, remains a fascinating and relevant topic for future consideration.

2025-06-19T18:31:56,"Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity","BitcoinWorld Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for a bold forecast that’s making waves across the crypto market . Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, recently shared a truly ambitious vision for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. What’s the Big Prediction from Arthur Hayes? In a candid interview, Arthur Hayes laid out his case for a staggering potential target for Bitcoin. He didn’t just suggest a modest increase; he’s looking at a monumental surge. According to Hayes, the Bitcoin price prediction could see BTC soaring to heights previously thought unimaginable by many. Specifically, Hayes believes Bitcoin could hit: $250,000 by the end of the current year (representing a significant gain from recent levels). A jaw-dropping $1,000,000 (or $1M) by the year 2028 . This isn’t just a random guess; Hayes ties this incredible forecast to specific macroeconomic factors he believes will play out over the coming years. How Does Fed Liquidity Fuel This Massive BTC Price? The core of Hayes’ argument revolves around the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve. He anticipates a colossal injection of liquidity into the U.S. economy. Here’s the breakdown of his reasoning: Massive Liquidity Injection: Hayes projects that the Federal Reserve will inject approximately $9 trillion in liquidity into the U.S. economy by 2028. Think of this as a significant increase in the money supply or available credit within the system. Flow into Traditional Finance First: This vast pool of liquidity doesn’t immediately rush into crypto. Hayes suggests it will first flow into traditional economic sectors and financial markets. This includes areas like manufacturing and other parts of the ‘real economy’. Spillover into Risk Assets: As this liquidity permeates the traditional system, it eventually seeks higher returns. This leads to capital flowing into ‘risk assets’. What are risk assets? They are investments like stocks, commodities, and yes, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have the potential for higher returns but also higher volatility compared to safer investments like government bonds. Bitcoin as a Prime Beneficiary: Given its nature as a scarce digital asset often seen as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, Bitcoin is positioned, in Hayes’ view, to be a major beneficiary of this liquidity spillover. What About Easing Bank Regulations? Arthur Hayes also pointed to another factor accelerating this process: changes in banking regulations. He noted that easing capital requirements for banks holding U.S. Treasuries is significant. How does this help Bitcoin? Freed-Up Lending Capacity: By requiring banks to hold less capital against their Treasury holdings, it effectively frees up capital that banks can use for lending. Credit Expansion: This increased capacity can drive an expansion of credit throughout the economy. More Fuel for the Fire: This expansion of credit adds another layer of liquidity and capital seeking returns, further contributing to the potential flow into risk assets and ultimately boosting the BTC price . It’s a complex interplay of monetary policy and banking regulations that Hayes believes creates a fertile ground for substantial asset price appreciation, with Bitcoin being a prime candidate for explosive growth. Is a $1M Bitcoin Price Realistic by 2028? Hayes’ prediction is undoubtedly bold and sits at the higher end of many long-term forecasts. While the mechanism he describes – liquidity flowing into risk assets – is a recognized economic principle, the exact scale and timeline are subject to debate. Investors should consider: Macroeconomic conditions can change rapidly. Regulatory environments for crypto are still evolving globally. Bitcoin’s own adoption rate and technological developments will play a role. However, coming from a figure like Arthur Hayes , whose insights often stem from a deep understanding of market structure and global finance, the prediction warrants attention and highlights the potential upside many see for Bitcoin in a world of expanding fiat currency supply. Concluding Thoughts on the $1M BTC Price Target Arthur Hayes’ forecast of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2028, driven by anticipated Federal Reserve liquidity and easing bank regulations, paints an incredibly bullish picture for the future of the crypto market . While ambitious, his rationale provides a clear framework rooted in macroeconomic forces. Whether BTC reaches this specific target or not, the prediction underscores the significant potential many experts see for Bitcoin as global liquidity expands.

2025-06-19T18:31:52,"Momentum, Wormhole & OKX partner to boost Sui network liquidity","Momentum, a decentralized finance protocol built on Sui, is teaming up with Wormhole and OKX Wallet to boost cross-chain liquidity on the Sui network. The collaboration will see the Sui ( SUI ) blockchain benefit from an influx of billions of dollars in cross-chain liquidity, Momentum said in an announcement . As part of this quest to bring further interoperability and functionality to Sui, Momentum will tap into Wormhole ( W )’s native token transfer framework and OKX ‘s learn-to-earn platform OKX Cryptopedia. Momentum thus becomes the first decentralized exchange to support Wormhole’s NTT-powered assets, bringing seamless, native asset transfers from across Ethereum Virtual Machine chains and Solana to Sui. Big news from @MMTFinance . We’re building with @wormhole and OKX @wallet to unlock billions in cross-chain liquidity for the @SuiNetwork ecosystem. This is a major leap forward in development, and it’s just the beginning. — Momentum (@MMTFinance) June 19, 2025 You might also like: Sui rallies past $1.75B TVL as bitcoin and stablecoin flows spike Support for Gate, MEXC tokens As a top interoperability protocol, Wormhole accounts for over $60 billion in all-time volume. The launch of NTT on Sui goes live with initial support for Gate Token ( GT ) and MEXC Token ( MX ). Momentum will also support Solana memecoin Bonk ( BONK ) as one of the first tokens in the Wormhole NTT to Sui initiative. Meanwhile, OKX Cryptopedia is accessible via OKX Wallet, and its learn-to-earn program with a prize pool of more than $1 million will support Momentum and other Sui network players. Assets to be spotlighted will include xSUI, a newly-launched liquid staking token and xBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) token on OKX. “By bringing our Native Token Transfers framework to Sui, we’re enabling seamless cross-chain liquidity flows that will strengthen Momentum’s market positioning as they are able to support new native assets and attract new liquidity,” Dan Reecer, co-founder of Wormhole Foundation, said in a statement. The partnership will seed the supported token pairs on Momentum to boost the protocol’s total value locked, with this going live ahead of the network’s launch of the bridge in September. Momentum launched in beta on March 31, 2025, with growth momentum sending its TVL to an all-time high of over $95 million within 10 weeks. The project recently raised a strategic round at a $100 million valuation led by OKX Ventures, and participation of the venture capital arms of Coinbase, Gate.io, KuCoin and MEXC crypto exchanges.

2025-06-19T18:30:09,"Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent","Ethereum is currently facing a pivotal moment as it continues to consolidate below the $3,000 level. Bulls are targeting a breakout above this key resistance zone, which could trigger a major upward move. However, broader market conditions remain fragile. Geopolitical tensions—particularly the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran—continue to create a high-risk macroeconomic environment, leading to increased volatility and intermittent selling pressure across risk assets. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% Despite these challenges, ETH has shown resilience by holding above the $2,500 support zone. The price has remained locked in a narrow trading range for weeks, reflecting market indecision and caution among participants. According to a technical analysis shared by top analyst Daan, Ethereum continues to trade within this very tight range, with price wicks on both sides consistently getting absorbed. This type of price action signals growing compression, often a precursor to a strong directional move once one side gives in. Traders are now closely monitoring the structure for a higher timeframe close above $2,800, which could validate bullish momentum and open the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, the market appears balanced, and any shift in geopolitical developments may quickly tilt sentiment in either direction. Ethereum Prepares For Breakout as Market Awaits Confirmation Ethereum remains over 60% below its 2024 high of $4,100, but the asset is showing signs of recovery after months of downward pressure and indecision. Bulls have struggled to regain control throughout the year, but recent price action indicates the start of a potential rally. This recovery, however, remains tentative and will require confirmation through a higher timeframe close above critical resistance levels, particularly the $2,800–$3,000 range. The broader environment continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty—including rising U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about inflation—are creating headwinds for risk assets, Ethereum included. Despite this, ETH has managed to hold key support above the $2,500 level, a sign that bulls are defending their ground. According to technical analysis shared by analyst Daan, Ethereum is currently trading within a very tight range, with price wicks on both sides being consistently absorbed. This type of compression typically signals an incoming surge in volatility. Daan notes that once one side gives in, the resulting move often becomes explosive and sustained. The current range-bound action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but that balance won’t last forever. Traders are watching closely for a decisive higher timeframe close above resistance—or below support—as confirmation of the next trend direction. With ETH positioned near major technical zones, a breakout could lead to significant momentum, potentially bringing Ethereum closer to reclaiming the psychological $3,000 mark and reigniting a push toward cycle highs. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Ethereum Continues Range-Bound Trading As Key Support Holds Ethereum (ETH) remains locked in a tight range between approximately $2,500 and $2,800, showing little directional clarity over the past several weeks. The chart above (12-hour timeframe) reflects persistent consolidation with multiple wicks on both ends of the candles, indicating absorption of both bullish and bearish momentum. This suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have taken firm control. ETH currently trades near $2,540 and is holding above the 100-period simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as short-term support. The 50 SMA has flattened, further reinforcing the sideways nature of the price action. Volume has also tapered off, typical in compression phases that often precede strong breakouts or breakdowns. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,675–$2,800 resistance zone, the 200 SMA near $2,117 may become relevant as a deeper support target. However, as long as ETH maintains price action above $2,500, bulls are still in play. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack The structure suggests that Ethereum is building energy for a decisive move. A higher timeframe close above $2,800 could trigger a new leg up toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a break below $2,500 could lead to renewed bearish pressure. For now, traders are watching for breakout confirmation.

2025-06-19T18:13:23,"Binance price outlook: Can BNB break out of the $400–$800 range?","Binance continues to trade sideways in a tightly defined high time frame range, with $800 as resistance and $400 as support. As this range matures, the likelihood of a major breakout, or breakdown, increases. Until then, traders should prepare for continued oscillation and plan around key levels. Binance ( BNB ) has been consolidating for weeks, and the structure shows no signs of an immediate breakout. However, the ongoing sideways action is setting the stage for a larger volatility expansion in the near future once resistance or support breaks. Key technical points Range High: $800 resistance with deviation and rejection confirmed Range Low: $400 support, aligning with the 200 MA and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement Rotational Structure: Price action has respected both edges of the range, creating a clear oscillation pattern BNBUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView The $800 region is acting as a strong resistance level, with price failing to close convincingly above it. A clear deviation from this level has already occurred, confirming a rejection and a rotation back into the mid-range. This resistance aligns with the value area high and sits just above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both adding to its technical significance. You might also like: Musk’s X to offer investment and trading in ‘super app’: report If price continues to reject around this high time frame resistance, the probability increases for a full range rotation back to the $400 support. This support is a key technical zone, it coincides with the 200-day moving average and another 0.618 Fibonacci level, and it also holds untapped liquidity built over the past several months. A test of this area would offer a clean sweep of downside liquidity, potentially setting the stage for a stronger bullish reaction. BNB remains firmly within a rotational range structure, and no breakout has yet occurred. For long-term investors and swing traders, the optimal long opportunity likely lies near the $400 mark, should price revisit that level with confirmation. Until then, entering mid-range positions carries unnecessary risk. What to expect in the coming price action Unless BNB breaks above $800 or loses the $400 support, price is expected to continue ranging. Traders should focus on the edges of the range for positioning, with $400 acting as the ideal accumulation zone and $800 as the breakout trigger. Until a clear shift in structure appears, range-bound strategies remain favorable.

It’d be a shame…”. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X He also says that he is remaining bullish on Bitcoin since the flagship crypto asset continues to exhibit market strength amid challenging macroeconomic factors. “War.

2025-06-19T17:44:28,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump Calls for Massive US Crypto Investment","Spot volumes climb whenever Bitcoin dips, and fresh stablecoin prints hint that sidelined capital is re-entering the market with purpose. Although Bitcoin has drifted into a cooling pattern, on-chain wallet growth remains steady, a classic mark of quiet accumulation. What traders lacked was a spark to convert that patience into conviction. They found it in Donald Trump’s newest volley of pro-crypto remarks. The President framed the current consolidation as a launch pad rather than a warning sign. His comments have already begun to ripple through order books, lifting depth and nudging funding rates higher as market participants position for a fresh swing in the short term. Why Trump’s Message Reshapes Global Sentiment When Washington speaks, liquidity desks from Frankfurt to Singapore reach for the volume knob. The United States still hosts the world’s deepest capital pools, and its policy choices shape the compliance playbooks of many other jurisdictions. That is why Donald Trump’s Truth Social post on 18 June resonated far outside American borders. The screenshot shows him celebrating a Senate vote that pushed a comprehensive digital-assets bill through the chamber, calling it “pure genius” and vowing to sign it the moment the House sends a clean version to his desk. Though the text does not specify the title, aides have hinted at a framework focused on strict asset backing for payment tokens, streamlined federal licensing, and clear guardrails for consumer protection. In practical terms, it would give banks and fintech firms a green light to launch fully collateralized dollar tokens, unlocking fresh demand for blockchain rails and likely accelerating institutional flows into Bitcoin as the benchmark collateral asset. Trump paired that optimism with another jab at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates unchanged. Lower borrowing costs would amplify the impact of any regulatory breakthrough by reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as Bitcoin. The combination of legislative momentum and pressure for easier monetary policy has already brightened derivative sentiment. Funding flipped positive on several Asian exchanges within hours, and European desks reported a sudden uptick in spot inquiries from family offices. If the bill becomes law, other governments are expected to follow with parallel initiatives, turning domestic development into a global adoption catalyst. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump’s Stance Could Trigger Global Interest Surge BTC Bull BTC Bull offers a creative way for accessing Bitcoin upside without the complexities of direct leverage or derivative exposure. Its design hinges on a supply adjustment mechanism that increases token issuance as Bitcoin’s price reaches defined thresholds. The concept is simple: every time Bitcoin reaches a particular price milestone, every BTCBULL token holder stands to win airdrops. What sets BTC Bull apart is its compatibility with long-term capital, especially from investors who prefer on-chain exposure with built-in directional acceleration. It offers a path that avoids liquidation risk and removes counterparty dependencies while still amplifying returns when BTC trends upward. Its emphasis on conservative treasury management helps insulate the protocol during choppy or sideways markets. While it does mainly seem like a meme coin, its utility is creative and well thought of, for the long term, a combination that really puts a heavy interest on the token. So for those looking to position ahead of structural growth in digital assets, BTC Bull provides a well-architected, autonomous exposure layer built specifically to enhance directional returns without the overhead of traditional financial tools. SUBBD SUBBD is built for creators who seek full control over how they monetize content, manage memberships, and engage communities. It provides an alternative to traditional subscription platforms by allowing each creator to deploy their own branded access token. These tokens grant tiered entry to private content feeds, community perks, and real-time engagement features, all embedded within a single on-chain ecosystem. Its utility lies in how the platform handles revenue and data ownership. Creators earn income instantly into self-custodied wallets, without relying on third-party payout schedules or enduring platform commissions. At the same time, content access is governed by smart contracts that enforce entitlements transparently: viewership, renewals, and tipping mechanisms are all automated, cutting down on manual moderation or billing disputes. What makes SUBBD particularly powerful is its backend modularity. It can support everything from gated video streams and course content to event-based ticketing or even exclusive DAO voting rights tied to creator governance. The platform includes built-in compliance tools like region-specific access restrictions, tax summary generation, and anti-bot verification, all of which are features that make it viable for scale and cross-border use without adding friction. 99Bitcoins , a leading educational YouTube channel, also vouched for the token’s potential, dubbing it as a 100x gem. Its utility is well aligned with a maturing digital economy, where creators are moving toward direct relationships with their audiences, disintermediation of platforms, and decentralized income channels. SUBBD equips them with exactly that: programmable infrastructure that supports sustainable, creator-first monetization while maintaining the flexibility to evolve with future digital payment frameworks and audience interaction models. Solaxy Solaxy is a layer-two blockchain that bridges two of the most significant ecosystems in crypto: Ethereum’s robust security layer and Solana’s high-throughput infrastructure. Rather than relying on a monolithic chain or compromising between performance and decentralization, Solaxy integrates the best of both through a dual-verification architecture. Transactions execute quickly on a Solana-compatible layer, while periodic proofs anchor finality to Ethereum’s base layer, offering scalability without compromising the integrity of historical data. The native currency is the SOLX token, which powers transactions, prioritization, and resource allocation through a dynamic fee structure that adjusts based on real-time network load. Developers are able to build applications that inherit Ethereum-grade security while benefiting from the low latency required for high-frequency interactions like trading, payments, or gaming. The protocol includes a compiler toolset that allows Ethereum-based projects to port their smart contracts into Solaxy’s environment with minimal friction. This enables Solaxy to serve as a migration hub for developers looking to expand to faster execution environments without leaving Ethereum’s ecosystem entirely. Projects gain not only speed but also broader interoperability, since assets and data can move between chains with native compatibility. Solaxy’s architecture supports applications that require fast confirmation times but still demand secure audit trails, such as digital payments, decentralized identity systems, or real-time marketplaces. It is not just another scaling solution, but also an execution layer optimized for modern use cases where speed, security, and cross-chain access must coexist by design. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token sits as the native token of a self-custody suite that treats the wallet as more than a key manager. Within the application, every balance, network bridge, and decentralized exchange route is abstracted into a single account view, allowing users to shift assets or stake liquidity through guided flows that feel closer to standard banking than to protocol dashboards. Holding BEST is the mechanism that unlocks those features. When a user routes trades through the in-app aggregator, a portion of the fee is automatically converted to BEST and redistributed to active stakers. This circular capture model turns each user into a partial beneficiary of aggregate network activity. BEST also reduces gas expenditure for supported chains through a pooled rebate fund, which becomes especially powerful when congestion peaks during market expansions. In practice, the token acts as both a participation credential and a cost-control tool. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 It has already raised upwards of $13 million, and could very likely be listed across many major exchanges shortly. Token holders can commit BEST to weight their vote on listings, interface upgrades, or new chain integrations. Because voting power decays if tokens sit idle, the model encourages continuous engagement rather than one-off governance events. That dynamic keeps development priorities aligned with features that drive real usage, such as native support for regulated stablecoin rails that may emerge if current policy discussions mature into law. Finally, a custodial-agnostic recovery layer is secured by an insurance pool funded with a fraction of swap fees settled in BEST. This reserve backs optional coverage for lost-key events, addressing a longstanding adoption hurdle by blending traditional assurance concepts with transparent on-chain accounting. Conclusion When national leadership not only acknowledges digital assets but actively pushes for their integration into financial policy, it forces a reassessment of what the next cycle might look like. For investors, the window ahead may favor tokens that do more than move with the market. The ones tied to actual mechanics like settlement, access, scalability, or utility stand to gain from a climate where functionality is finally being given the green light. The projects covered above each offer something grounded in purpose. Not hype, not noise, just well-engineered frameworks that may find stronger footing as the broader environment becomes more accommodating. With a new chapter possibly opening, these are the kinds of assets that deserve a closer look. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-19T17:35:10,"Majority of Russian miners are operating outside the law","Efforts to legalize the activities of crypto miners in Russia haven’t been particularly fruitful and only about 30% have so far registered with the country’s tax authority. The assessment comes from the finance ministry in Moscow, which says it’s working to bring the rest of the growing industry out of the shadows, the main purpose of regulating the sector. Majority of Russian miners minting outside the law Less than a third of all Russian entities involved in cryptocurrency mining have been added to the special register of the Federal Tax Service (FNS) which allows them to operate legally, according to the Ministry of Finance (Minfin). The legalization of the Bitcoin-related business, which has been expanding in the energy-rich Russian Federation, is far from complete, Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov told Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS. “Our general approach, when we introduced regulation, was to bring this industry out of the shadows as much as possible,” Chebeskov reminded. Also quoted by Russian crypto media outlets Bits.media and RBC Crypto, he admitted: “So far, only 30% of all miners have entered the register maintained by the FNS, and this process is still far from complete.” The Minfin official emphasized his department will continue work to legalize the remaining two-thirds of the crypto mining sector. These efforts started last year when Russia adopted legislation designed to regulate the crypto activity. Since the new law entered into force in November 2024, companies and individual entrepreneurs can mine legally as long as they register with the Russian tax authority and pay due taxes . Private citizens minting digital currencies are not required to do that, as long as they use less than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. The FNS registry was launched in January and by April 1, registration entries had reached 722, including 116 “mining infrastructure operators,” or providers of hosting services and data center operators. Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Tatarstan account of the highest number legal miners in Russia. Fines and crypto seizure await illegal crypto miners Many miners prefer to remain in the shadow economy as they fear criminal prosecution over illegally imported equipment, RBC noted in its report. According to the business news portal, an amnesty is already being discussed between legislators and industry members. Those who decide to continue to mine illegally are going to face heavy fines and other punitive measures, including confiscation of the minted cryptocurrency. According to amendments to Russia’s Code of Administrative Offenses, currently under consideration, the monetary penalties may reach 2 million rubles ($25,000) for companies and 400,000 rubles ($5,000) for private individuals. Russia mulls lower electricity rates for legal mining farms Illegal, also called “gray” crypto miners in Russia have been blamed for increasing electricity deficits in a number of Russian regions. Authorities have reacted by banning all mining in almost a dozen territories and subjects of the Russian Federation. Critics say this hurts legal mining businesses, bringing down tax revenues and electricity sales. “We need to regulate mining, not ban it,” Russia’s Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabchak was quoted as stating on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Speaking to TASS, he elaborated: “The Ministry of Energy sees the point not in prohibition, but in more subtle regulation of mining.” Earlier in June, Grabchak told reporters that his department favors regulatory changes that will help avoid restrictions on cryptocurrency mining in some parts of the country and is working on incentives to attract miners to regions with surplus energy. Now he revealed these may include offering take-or-pay tariffs for the electricity consumed by legal mining farms. He noted the rates “won’t be much lower, but they will be more long-term.” In May, he hinted on adding miners to a separate category of consumers enjoying lower energy prices that will apply across all Russian regions.

2025-06-19T17:20:55,"XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions","BitcoinWorld XRP Traders Panic: Bearish Sentiment Dominates Amid Middle East Tensions Global events have a powerful ripple effect, and the world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Recently, the escalating situation involving Middle East tensions has sent shivers through financial markets, including the digital asset space. For many, the focus is squarely on how this uncertainty impacts their portfolios, and specifically, what it means for the XRP price . What Are XRP Traders Doing Amid the Uncertainty? According to reports, particularly from DL News, XRP traders are reacting to the geopolitical climate by bracing for potential declines. The derivatives exchange Deribit has reportedly seen increased activity from traders taking bearish positions on XRP. This means they are essentially betting that the XRP price will fall further. These traders are anticipating a notable drop, with some positioning for an additional 5% decrease in XRP’s value. This isn’t just random speculation; it reflects a growing bearish sentiment specifically targeting XRP in the wake of heightened global risk. Why are XRP traders so sensitive to this news? Geopolitical instability often leads investors to move away from riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, while sometimes seen as uncorrelated, frequently react negatively to events that threaten global stability or signal potential economic disruption. How Are Middle East Tensions Shaking the Crypto Market? The connection between Middle East tensions and the crypto market might not be immediately obvious, but it’s a significant one. Major geopolitical events introduce uncertainty and increase risk aversion among investors worldwide. When tensions escalate: Investors seek safety: Capital tends to flow out of assets perceived as risky (like stocks and cryptocurrencies) and into safer havens (like government bonds or gold). Economic outlook darkens: Conflict can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, and generally create a less favorable environment for economic growth, dampening enthusiasm for speculative assets. Policy responses: Governments and central banks might signal policy shifts in response to the crisis, further influencing market direction. The recent signals from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding potential U.S. involvement added another layer of complexity and concern, amplifying the market’s reaction. This isn’t just affecting XRP; the broader crypto market , including giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has also experienced declines, demonstrating the systemic impact of these global events. Decoding the Bearish Sentiment: Why Are Traders Betting Down? The prevailing bearish sentiment among XRP traders isn’t solely tied to geopolitical fears, although that’s a major catalyst right now. Bearish sentiment reflects a collective expectation that an asset’s price is likely to fall. Several factors contribute to this outlook: Geopolitical Risk: As discussed, escalating Middle East tensions are a primary driver, increasing overall market fear. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession can contribute to risk-off attitudes. Technical Analysis: Traders often look at price charts and patterns. If XRP’s chart shows signs of weakness or breaks key support levels, it can reinforce a bearish view. Market Contagion: When major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin experience declines, it often pulls altcoins like XRP down with them, regardless of their individual fundamentals. The weakness in the broader crypto market contributes significantly to the negative outlook for XRP. Specific XRP Factors: While less prominent in this specific report, ongoing regulatory discussions or developments related to Ripple’s legal status can also influence sentiment around the XRP price . The accumulation of these factors can create a powerful wave of bearish sentiment , leading traders to open short positions or sell their holdings in anticipation of lower prices. Broader Crypto Market Reaction: Is It Just XRP? While the report highlights XRP traders specifically, it’s crucial to understand that the reaction is not isolated. The entire crypto market is interconnected and sensitive to major external shocks. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often dictates the overall trend. When Bitcoin sees selling pressure due to global events or macro fears, altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, and others typically follow suit, often with greater volatility. The declines observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum following the news signals underscore that the current downturn is a market-wide phenomenon, triggered by the same underlying fear driven by Middle East tensions . This collective movement reinforces the bearish sentiment across the board, impacting the XRP price as part of the larger ecosystem. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for XRP Traders Trading during times of heightened volatility and bearish sentiment can be challenging, but informed decisions are key. Here are some actionable insights for XRP traders : Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the XRP price moves against your position. Stay Informed, Avoid Panic: Keep track of geopolitical developments and market analysis, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or hype. Understand Middle East tensions are a factor, but not the only one. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While focusing on XRP, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different assets or even different sectors within crypto. Understand Derivatives Risk: If you are trading derivatives like those on Deribit, be acutely aware of the leverage involved and the potential for rapid losses, especially with significant bearish sentiment in play. Look for Opportunities (with caution): Volatility can present opportunities for those with a strategy. This might involve shorting (betting on price decline) if you are experienced, or identifying potential entry points if you believe the long-term outlook for the XRP price remains positive despite short-term headwinds. However, timing the market is extremely difficult. Re-evaluate Your Thesis: Step back and consider if the current situation fundamentally changes your long-term view on XRP and the crypto market . For many, observing from the sidelines during extreme uncertainty might be the most prudent strategy. The goal is to preserve capital and be ready when clearer trends emerge. Summary: Geopolitics Casts a Shadow on XRP and the Crypto Market In conclusion, the report highlighting XRP traders positioning for declines underscores the significant impact of global events, particularly Middle East tensions , on the digital asset space. The growing bearish sentiment is a direct response to the increased risk and uncertainty introduced by the geopolitical climate and broader market reactions. While XRP price is specifically mentioned due to trader positioning on platforms like Deribit, this reflects a wider trend affecting the entire crypto market , including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Navigating these turbulent times requires careful consideration, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of how external factors can influence the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading.

The investment will be used to scale validator capacity, deepen cross-chain liquidity rails, and fast-track the launch of two key AI primitives: an AI Launchpad and an AI Liquidity Manager. Both tools will empower developers and traders with on-chain access to intelligence-driven market products. Building the Future of On-Chain AI With the convergence of AI and blockchain moving from theory to production, Units.Network is positioning itself at the centre of this emerging frontier. Analysts project the blockchain-AI market to grow from $0.7 billion in 2025 to $1.9 billion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of around 28%. The launch of Units.Network’s AI Launchpad is intended to lower the barrier of entry for innovators, while the AI Liquidity Manager is designed to create fairer and more efficient markets. “This investment allows us to place practical artificial intelligence at the centre of our ecosystem,” said Sasha Ivanov. “The Launchpad lowers barriers for innovators, and the liquidity manager will create fairer and more efficient markets for builders and traders.” Robert Baker, Managing Partner at Nimbus Capital, added: “We’ve been tracking the AI-blockchain convergence closely, and Units.Network stood out for delivering real on-chain utility.” Market Momentum and Community Expansion Beyond institutional backing, Units.Network is also accelerating community growth. The project recently launched a DAO-led performance grant program, offering incentives to developers whose applications attract over $1 million in total value locked (TVL). These grants are expected to support a healthy pipeline of ecosystem projects ahead of the Launchpad’s public debut later this year. Retail interest in AI-linked crypto tokens has surged, with combined valuations rising from $2.7 billion to more than $26 billion in the past year, outpacing Bitcoin’s performance. As investor enthusiasm grows and enterprise blockchain adoption accelerates, Units.Network’s blend of AI-native tooling and Layer-1 scalability positions it as a key player in the next wave of crypto innovation.

2025-06-19T17:00:10,"Why The June 22 Date Is Important As Bitcoin Price Flirts With $100,000","The Bitcoin price action is currently testing investors’ nerves as it hovers around $100,000. While it flirts with this psychological level, analysts are highlighting June 22, 2025, as a key date for potential volatility. Backed by both historical volatility patterns and technical indicators, this date is gearing up to be a critical window for Bitcoin’s next move. Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility On June 22 Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as it trades above the $100,000 mark, with technical signals identified by TradingView expert ‘readCrypto’ aligning around a critical time frame—-June 22. The chart analysis shows that June 22 is an important date, signaling the projected start of Bitcoin’s next volatility window, with a potential to break out or break down depending on how the flagship cryptocurrency reacts to key support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,731, close to a pivotal confluence range between $104,463 and $106,133—a zone highlighted as a structural mid-point. This area is defined by the DOM (60) and a Heikin-Ashi high point on the price chart, marking the formation of a recent upper boundary. Moreover, the lower end of the range sits around $99,705, which is the HA-High support level, where the price has previously been tested but not yet broken. According to the analyst, the June 22 date is important because it coincides with the confluence of key price levels with the M-Signal indicator on the weekly chart. This indicator is currently rising and aligning near the $99,705 HA-high level. If Bitcoin falls below this level, it could signal the start of a deeper corrective move, possibly toward the monthly M-Signal line or even the $89,294 region, corresponding with the 2.618 Fibonacci. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above this level and breaks out of the $108,316 resistance, momentum could shift back to the upside. The analyst has set upper bullish targets near $109,598 and $111,696, reflecting the final resistance zone before new highs. Support Zones And Momentum Indicate Tense Standoff Moving past readCrypto’s volatility-driven projection, the TradingView analyst’s Bitcoin chart shows that the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) oscillator remains below the zero line. This suggests that despite recent gains, selling pressure may still be dominating the broader market. However, the histogram in the chart shows signs of waning momentum on the sell side. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This divergence aligns with Bitcoin’s weakening Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates momentum may be cooling. The low OBV readings, combined with the recent bounce from a lower support range, also underscore an intense standoff within the market. If Bitcoin breaks below the Heikin Ashi high point at $99,705, a retest of new lows at $89,294 is more than likely. Until then, readCrypto’s analysis shows that all eyes are on the $104,000 to $106,000 zone. The area between $99,705 and $108,316 now defines the high-boundary consolidation range. A confirmed move outside this range, mainly triggered during the June 21-13 window, could dictate Bitcoin’s next major move.

2025-06-19T17:00:00,"AgriFORCE Powers 120 Bitcoin Mining Rigs With Stranded Natural Gas in Alberta","AgriFORCE Unveils Natural Gas-Fueled Bitcoin Mining Facility in Alberta Canadian agriculture company AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. unveiled a new facility using stranded natural gas to power 120 Bitcoin mining machines. The Berwyn, Alberta-based facility was unveiled with BlueFlare Energy and is now running on 425 kilowatts (kW), delivering a hashrate of 32 petahashes per second (PH/s). Stranded gas refers to natural gas that is not able to be delivered to market due to logistics or economics. AgriFORCE’s process enables unused gas to be turned into computer power without having to navigate the years-long permitting and infrastructure bottleneck. Two Additional Sites Planned Across Alberta AgriFORCE has executed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare Energy to expand its model of mining into two new sites in Oyen and Hinton, Alberta. The new sites would be a carbon copy of the Berwyn model, further expanding the company’s foray into gas-powered crypto mining. “We don’t wait on permits or grid upgrades — we convert gas to compute in weeks, not years,” CEO Jolie Kahn said. AgriFORCE’s Bitcoin Strategy: Hold and Expand The company revealed that it has mined already 7 Bitcoin with an approximate value of $735,000 from operations in Alberta and Ohio. The mined BTC of up to 50% of AgriFORCE will be reserved in treasury while the balance will be employed to facilitate operational expansion. The company may also utilize up to 50% of funds raised to directly buy Bitcoin. Stock Performance and Financial Outlook AgriFORCE shares (AGRI) rose 1.85% to finish trading on Tuesday at $1.10. While there was the daily gain, the company is down over 53% year to date, according to Google Finance. Still, the company produced solid financials in 2024, with revenue jumping 317% and net profit increasing 66% year over year. Renewable Energy Picks Up Speed in Crypto Mining AgriFORCE is part of a broader trend within the crypto mining industry: shifting to alternative and renewable sources of energy. According to TheMinerMag, the price of one BTC to produce in Q1 2025 hit $64,000 and will rise to $70,000 by the end of Q2. With increased energy prices, miners are looking more towards renewable resources. A new report showed a growth in the adoption of renewable energy by Bitcoin miners at 5.8% per year, while reliance on coal is gradually reducing.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/agriforce-powers-120-bitcoin-mining-rigs-with-stranded-natural-gas-in-alberta/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare
