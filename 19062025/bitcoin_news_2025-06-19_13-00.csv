2025-06-19T10:55:46,"Business Leader: Stablecoins Will Make XRP Become a Neutral Bridge Asset","Jake Claver, a prominent business leader and financial strategist, has asserted that the growing prominence of stablecoins does not reduce the need for XRP. In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Claver addressed the misconception that the rise of fiat-backed and algorithmic stablecoins would diminish XRP’s utility in cross-border finance . According to Claver, that view is incorrect. He stated that the current $27 trillion locked in Nostro/Vostro accounts globally could expand to over $50 trillion, citing distrust among banks regarding the use of competing stablecoins as the primary driver for that potential increase. Claver emphasized that XRP, functioning as a neutral bridge asset , maintains its relevance because it is not issued by any specific institution or nation-state, making it a uniquely suited tool for settlement between parties that do not trust each other. People think stablecoins reduce XRP's need. Wrong. $27T in Nostro/Vostro accounts could grow to $50T+ because banks won't trust competitors' coins. XRP becomes the neutral bridge. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) June 17, 2025 Community Response Highlights Diverging Views Claver’s post attracted commentary from X users who expanded on or challenged his assertion. One user, who goes by the name Trenton valley boy, echoed Claver’s point about trust in financial counterparties. He noted that the core issue in the present financial system is the lack of trust between institutions, especially when dealing with manipulated or overinflated currencies. According to him, XRP addresses that issue through the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature, which eliminates counterparty risk by allowing for trustless liquidity provision on-chain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The user then compared Bitcoin to XRP, stating that even Bitcoin represents a form of counterparty risk due to its volatile price action and longer settlement times. He argued that the volatility during transaction finality windows can lead to significant financial impact, especially when values shift by thousands of dollars in minutes. In his view, stablecoins issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) provide a counterparty-risk-free alternative. He acknowledged that XRP itself could remain volatile, but stablecoins moving via XRPL in three to five seconds do not suffer from the same risk. He concluded by stating that the ability to recognize and act on these developments is essential to being prepared for the future of money movement. Criticism Refutes XRP Bridge Currency Narrative However, the post was not without opposition. Another user, STU, firmly disagreed with Claver’s claims. He argued that the vision of banks using XRP as a bridge currency is outdated and no longer aligns with current market dynamics. According to STU, that idea represents a belief from 2017 that never materialized at scale. He stated that no banks are currently using XRP for bridging transactions, and suggested that this was the motivation behind Ripple’s shift toward RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin . STU concluded that Ripple is now focusing on bringing volume to the XRP Ledger through the issuance of a trusted stablecoin, rather than relying on the XRP token itself as the primary utility. The broader relevance of Claver’s argument lies in the evolving architecture of international finance. With increasing regulatory clarity and emerging technologies like AMM and tokenized fiat currencies on-chain, platforms such as the XRPL continue to evolve. While some argue XRP’s original use case is no longer viable, others maintain that the system still needs a trust-minimized, efficient bridge asset.

2025-06-19T10:50:28,"CZ wants crypto platforms to add inheritance tools and minor access","Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urged crypto platforms to introduce a “will feature” that allows users to designate beneficiaries for their digital assets after death. He also called for minors to be allowed to hold accounts to receive inherited crypto funds. CZ posted on X that crypto platforms should help people plan what happens to their assets after they die. “Every platform should have a ‘will function’—so that when someone is no longer around, their assets can be distributed to designated accounts according to specified proportions.” CZ asks crypto platforms to add inheritance tools and allow minors to receive crypto CZ explained that setting up inheritance in cold or private wallets is challenging for the average user. Many people don’t know how to share private keys securely, and without a proper system, families can end up completely locked out of their assets. CZ suggested creating a simple tool where users could name their beneficiaries and define percentages of the assets each would receive to make inheritance easier, safer, and more accessible for everyone. It would also ensure that crypto doesn’t become lost forever just because someone didn’t have a plan. Many people supported the idea on X and said it was long overdue. @Ranofty commented that it was “a great idea ,” adding that planning for family members was not only smart but necessary. Another user, @Tabraiz, said CZ’s suggestion showed real responsibility and vision. They argue that every crypto holder should take estate planning seriously because more value is digitally stored today. However, the proposal also raised some concerns, as some people were uncomfortable with allowing minors to receive digital assets. @diamondhandjs disagreed with the suggestion and argued that minors should not be involved with crypto even as passive beneficiaries . They said exposing young people to them could be harmful and irresponsible because crypto platforms are like gambling environments. @lfp8023 raised doubts about how fraud and abuse could be prevented when he asked, “How does the platform even know you’re dead?” @Predator_fund warned that platforms might keep the funds by default if they don’t design clear and accessible inheritance tools. Meanwhile, a few people said crypto isn’t just about money. One user, @uniswap12, mentioned that his Binance account had social and digital value beyond just crypto holdings. The user suggested that platforms should consider letting users pass on entire accounts, including transaction history, social data, or NFTs. Reports estimate that more than $1 billion in crypto is lost yearly when users die without sharing access credentials or leaving any backup plans, and their families end up frustrated because they don’t even know the crypto exists or how to claim it. Binance introduces emergency contact and inheritance features Binance released a new platform update that included an inheritance feature on June 12, which allows users to choose and assign an emergency contact to be notified if the account remains inactive for a long time and, if necessary, request access to the crypto assets left behind. The system will automatically send alerts via email or SMS to both the user and the emergency contact to confirm they’re okay and simply taking a break if it detects extended inactivity for a certain number of days. The emergency contact can step in and submit an official inheritance request if there’s no response for an extended period. To make a claim, the emergency contact must provide supporting documents, such as a death certificate and a valid government-issued ID. Binance will manually review the request to verify the details and ensure the process is genuine. The system currently supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB).

2025-06-19T10:41:36,"Worries Over Bitcoin Treasuries Grow — Can Solaxy 100x as First-Ever Solana Layer-2?","Corporate treasury strategies are entering a new era as traditional finance and crypto converge. Two standout approaches are now reshaping how institutions manage digital assets. Approach One : The well-established Bitcoin playbook – buy $BTC and hold. Borrow billions to do so if necessary. Approach Two : A bold new frontier on Solana – buy $SOL and farm yield natively through chain-on-chain treasury mechanics. Both approaches have gained significant followings in recent months, with the $SOL treasury strategy emerging more recently. And with Solaxy preparing to launch the first true Solana Layer-2, the entire Solana-native treasury model could be about to jump to light speed. Debt-Fueled Bitcoin Strategies Face Growing Scrutiny MicroStrategy, the poster child of the Bitcoin treasury movement, now holds over $62B in BTC . That’s mostly been paid for using debt, including multiple convertible bond issuances. Saylor’s been widely lauded for his approach, and the Bitcoin Strategy is now seen everywhere. But while it’s a bold strategy, serious questions are now being asked. At the DigiAssets Conference held June 17-18, Anthony Scaramucci offered a pointed warning. He remains a long-term Bitcoin bull, but likened the current wave of debt-backed $BTC buying to the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) boom of 2020-2021. The damage would come if the companies ever started to unwind. They might be forced to sell Bitcoin to cover any debts. He isn’t alone in this concern. Swiss bank Sygnum recently echoed similar warnings, noting the risk of cascading liquidations if the price of BTC falls while debt obligations come due. In essence, what looks like bullish conviction may also be quietly sowing seeds of future volatility. The Solana Alternative: On-Chain, Yield-Driven, and Native Canadian DeFi Development Corp takes a radically different approach. Instead of issuing bonds to buy tokens, it’s building a self-sustaining, yield-generating treasury inside the Solana ecosystem. The company launched in April , and already holds a 620K $SOL reserve worth $90M. Their goal is to grow $SOL per share, not just stack tokens. To that end, in May, they purchased a Solana validator set. With the Solana validator, all purchased $SOL could be instantly staked, generating more yield and steadily increasing the all-important $SOL-to-shares ratio. There was a 7-for-1 stock split for the underlying DeFi Development Corp stock ($DFDV) in May to boost liquidity, but so far, the company’s strategy has paid off: $DFDV stock is up a massive 4,408% so far this year. The company’s success may already be inspiring imitators. Another Canadian company, SOL Strategies, just filed with the SEC to list on the NASDAQ. Will the new Solana treasury approach lead to a new class of crypto treasuries that are organic, resilient, and native to the chains they support? And if they do, what could that do to Solana and the upcoming Solana Layer-2, Solaxy? Solaxy ($SOLX) – Last Chance to Buy 100x Chance with First Solana Layer-2 With a new Solana treasury strategy making waves, Solaxy ($SOLX) could have perfect timing. Building treasuries for yield will require leveraging all that a blockchain has to offer. And with Solaxy, Solana now offers all of Ethereum’s infrastructure and scalability in addition to $SOL’s native low costs and speed. That could set Solaxy on course to explode as DeFi projects and meme coins flock to the new Layer 2. The Testnet is already live with the Block Explorer and Bridge . The full launch schedule runs into July and includes expanding the Solana-Ethereum bridge to Solaxy once it goes live. The schedule concludes on July 21, 2025, with the debut of the Solaxy Igniter, a pump.fun-style meme coin launchpad. The $SOLX token is available for $0.001766 for the next four days as part of the last chance to buy between the presale and token launch. Our own price prediction indicates the token could reach $0.025 by the end of the year, delivering 1300% returns to current investors. Don’t delay – this could be the lowest the token will ever go. Learn how to buy Solaxy with our guide . Visit the Solaxy presale page . Solaxy + Solana: The Future of Crypto Treasuries? The rise of Bitcoin treasuries brought institutional credibility to crypto, but it may have also introduced dangerous financial engineering. As criticism rises over the debt-based model, a Solana-native alternative is emerging. And Solaxy ($SOLX) is poised to supercharge the Solana ecosystem, indirectly further boosting Solana treasuries.

Price forecasts suggest ETH could climb modestly to around $2,665 by mid-2025. That’s a 2% uptick, which is not bad, but far from thrilling. Meanwhile, another name is making waves for a completely different reason. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just about growth. It’s about empowerment. Through its radical mobile mining model, Bitcoin Solaris is offering something Ethereum never could: a way for anyone, anywhere, to build wealth directly from their phone. And it’s doing so with unmatched speed, transparency, and inclusivity, making BTC-S more than a token. It’s a movement. Ethereum’s Steady Climb… and Its Limits Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto world. It powers thousands of dApps, secures billions in DeFi, and is the standard for smart contracts. But it’s also facing serious friction. Transaction fees, complexity, and staking barriers continue to make ETH more of a developer platform than a retail wealth machine. A 2% forecasted price increase in 2025 isn’t inspiring the next generation of investors. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris is delivering a completely new model. One where you don’t need to buy in big, you just need to start mining from your device. Bitcoin Solaris Mining: The Future of Accessible, Scalable Crypto Mining Bitcoin Solaris is flipping the mining industry upside down. Forget expensive hardware, confusing setups, or massive energy bills. BTC-S introduces a Universal Mining Model backed by the Solaris Nova App, creating a low-barrier gateway to crypto income. Here’s how it works: Device Flexibility : Whether you’re using a smartphone, a mid-range laptop, or an ASIC rig, you can mine BTC-S with optimized performance. Adaptive Mining: The upcoming app auto-tunes based on device specs to maximize returns and preserve battery life. All-in-One App: With one-tap mining, a built-in wallet, tutorials, and cross-platform support, the Solaris Nova App simplifies everything. This isn’t speculation, it’s execution. Bitcoin Solaris has already built a mining experience that feels more like opening an app than building a rig. Key Mining Features That Matter Solaris Nova App (Upcoming): Available across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and browsers. Users can mine with one tap and track performance with built-in metrics. Mining Power Marketplace: Trade, lease, or rent mining power in real-time using smart contracts.

Gamified Experience: Leaderboards, achievements, and built-in news tools create a vibrant mining community. Device-Aware Mining: From entry-level phones to powerful GPUs, every device contributes proportionally. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands Deep Technical Strengths Back the Vision Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just an app. It’s a dual-consensus blockchain operating on: Proof-of-Work (Base Layer): Secure, decentralized, and compatible with existing Bitcoin hardware. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (Solaris Layer): Lightning-fast, energy-efficient, and scalable. The system delivers up to 100,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, making it one of the fastest decentralized networks ever built. This hybrid architecture is backed by real-time validator rotation, Rust-based smart contracts, and optional ZKPs for privacy. Audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm BTC-S is ready for the big leagues. Ethereum vs Bitcoin Solaris: A Mining Perspective Feature Ethereum Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Not available Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App TPS Performance Around 30 after the merge Up to 100,000 Energy Efficiency Improved (PoS) Ultra-low with hybrid consensus Hardware Requirements High Any device, including smartphones User Inclusion Requires ETH purchase Mine freely from anywhere Presale Momentum Not applicable Over $5 million raised, 11.5K+ users Wallet Integration Third-party Built-in, secure, cross-platform Explosive Presale Momentum BTC-S is currently in Phase 8 of its presale, priced at $8.

A breakdown by Crypto Vlog covers the full range of technical breakthroughs, mining potential, and community traction BTC-S is building across Telegram and X . Conclusion: BTC-S Builds What Ethereum Can’t Ethereum is solid tech with global influence. But it’s not the gateway to wealth for the everyday user. Bitcoin Solaris is. It’s not promising passive gains from future scaling. It’s delivering daily earnings now through mobile mining, lightning-fast transactions, and universal accessibility. This is what decentralized wealth creation looks like in 2025. And you don’t need thousands of dollars to participate. You just need a phone.

2025-06-19T10:34:11,"Nobitex's Source Code Released a Day After Hackers Steal Tokens Across Bitcoin, EVM, Ripple Networks","The pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande released the full source code of Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, just a day after orchestrating a $100 million exploit across multiple blockchains as the war between the two countries nears the end of its first week. The move raised fresh concerns for users who have not yet withdrawn their assets from the platform because the code makes it extremely easy for nefarious actors to access and exploit. Israel attacked military and nuclear sites in Iran on Friday saying it had to take action to prevent its enemy, which has vowed to wipe the Jewish state off the map, attaining nuclear weapons. Iran responded with ballistic missile launches targeting the entire country, sending millions into shelters at short notice. In an X post on Thursday, the hacker group, whose name is Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, wrote: “Time’s up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN.” The leak included blockchain scripts, internal privacy settings and a list of servers, effectively dismantling the exchange’s back-end security. The source code dump follows through on threats issued a day earlier, when Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for the hack and promised to release internal data. The group accused Nobitex of aiding Iran in circumventing international sanctions and called the platform the “regime’s favorite sanctions violation tool.” Over $90 million in tokens from Bitcoin, EVM, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana and other networks were deliberately sent to burner addresses, making recovery unlikely. Blockchain data shows that funds were moved to provocatively named wallets, such as “1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX” and “DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t,” suggesting the use of brute-force-generated vanity addresses that the attackers do not hold private keys for. The IRCG, or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , is an powerful and influential branch of the Iranian military. Nobitex responded on Thursday, stating that no additional losses occurred after the leak and that it plans to begin restoring services within five days, although ongoing internet disruptions in Iran may delay the recovery.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/19/nobitexs-source-code-released-a-day-after-hackers-steal-tokens-across-bitcoin-evm-ripple-networks,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Markets|Hacks|Iran|Israel|Crypto Exchanges|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T10:30:09,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Phenomenal 8-Day Streak Sees $388.73M Boost for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Phenomenal 8-Day Streak Sees $388.73M Boost for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Exciting times continue in the world of cryptocurrency investments! The market for US spot Bitcoin ETFs is buzzing, recently demonstrating a significant period of sustained positive activity that’s capturing the attention of investors everywhere. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows On June 18th, the landscape for US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable development: a combined net inflow of a substantial $388.73 million. This figure isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the eighth consecutive trading day where these investment vehicles have attracted more money than they’ve seen withdrawn. This consistent trend, highlighted by data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, signals growing confidence and interest from the market. What exactly are these inflows? Essentially, they represent the total value of new money flowing into the ETFs as investors buy shares, minus the value of shares being sold (outflows). Positive net inflows indicate that there’s more buying pressure than selling pressure within these specific investment products. Which ETFs Are Leading the Charge? While the overall picture is positive, the inflows weren’t evenly distributed among all the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Some funds saw significant investor interest, while others experienced minor outflows or remained neutral. Here’s a breakdown of the key players on June 18th: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund continues to be a powerhouse, leading the pack with an impressive $279.27 million in net inflows. IBIT has consistently attracted large amounts of capital since its launch. Fidelity’s FBTC: Another major player, FBTC, also saw strong performance, bringing in $104.38 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s offering has been a popular choice alongside IBIT. Bitwise’s BITB: Bitwise’s ETF contributed positively to the total, recording $11.32 million in net inflows. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: The recently launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) added $10.12 million. This new fund is seen as a lower-fee alternative to Grayscale’s flagship product. Here’s a quick look at the numbers for the top movers: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (June 18th) IBIT BlackRock $279.27 million FBTC Fidelity $104.38 million BITB Bitwise $11.32 million BTC Grayscale (Mini Trust) $10.12 million Addressing GBTC Outflows In contrast to the positive trend seen in most funds, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a net outflow of $16.36 million on the same day. GBTC, which converted from a trust to an ETF, has seen significant outflows since the spot ETFs were approved. This is often attributed to investors moving to newer ETFs with lower fees or cashing out positions that were previously locked up in the trust structure. Despite this outflow, the combined inflows into other funds significantly outweighed the GBTC withdrawals, resulting in the strong overall positive figure. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S. market reported no significant net changes in inflows or outflows for June 18th, indicating that the activity was primarily concentrated in the funds mentioned above. What Does This Consecutive Inflow Streak Signify? An eight-day streak of net inflows is noteworthy for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs market. It suggests that: Sustained Demand: There is consistent buying interest, potentially from both retail and institutional investors, looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and easily accessible investment products. Growing Confidence: The prolonged positive trend can build confidence among potential investors who may have been hesitant initially. Market Integration: It highlights the increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets through these ETF structures. While daily flows can fluctuate, a streak like this points towards a potentially bullish sentiment developing around Bitcoin accessible via these regulated investment vehicles. Looking Ahead: The Impact of Bitcoin ETF Inflows The continued positive momentum in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a key metric for market observers. It can influence market sentiment and potentially contribute to price stability or upward movement for Bitcoin itself, as the ETF issuers need to buy BTC to back the shares being purchased by investors. The performance of funds like IBIT and FBTC , consistently attracting large sums, underscores their role in this new investment landscape. For investors, these ETFs offer a convenient way to add Bitcoin exposure to a traditional brokerage account without the complexities of buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in Bitcoin ETFs still carries the inherent volatility risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the $388.73 million net inflow on June 18th, extending an impressive eight-day streak, underscores the growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure via the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Led by strong performances from IBIT and FBTC , these inflows signal a potentially significant phase of institutional and retail adoption, despite continued outflows from GBTC . This trend remains a critical indicator of how traditional finance is embracing the digital asset space.

2025-06-19T10:20:22,"Iran’s Nobitex Exchange Faces Renewed Threat After Hackers Leak Core Code","The fallout from the $100 million Nobitex exchange hack continues to deepen as hackers release the platform’s full source code, exposing users to further risk amid an already fragile security situation. Key Takeaways: Hackers leaked Nobitex’s full source code, putting remaining user assets at risk. The $100M breach was politically motivated, with attackers burning most of the stolen funds. Iran imposed new crypto exchange curfews as Nobitex works to restore services amid internet disruptions. The Iranian crypto exchange, which suffered a major breach on Wednesday, is now facing renewed threats after the pro-Israel hacker group “Gonjeshke Darande” followed through on its warning to leak internal data. On Thursday, the group posted a link on X containing Nobitex’s source code, privacy configurations, cold wallet scripts, and server lists. “Time’s up – full source code linked below. ASSETS LEFT IN NOBITEX ARE NOW ENTIRELY OUT IN THE OPEN,” the group declared in its post, suggesting that any assets still on the platform are vulnerable. Hackers Share Nobitex Code in Politically Motivated Hack Gonjeshke Darande claims it targeted Nobitex due to its alleged ties to the Iranian government and its role in circumventing international sanctions. In a follow-up post on Wednesday, the group said it had burned $90 million across eight wallets, effectively removing the stolen funds from circulation. 12 hours ago 8 burn addresses burned $90M from the wallets of the regime's favorite sanctions violation tool, Nobitex. 12 hours from now The source-code of Nobitex will be open to the public, and Nobitex’s walled garden will be without walls. Where do you want your assets to be?… — Gonjeshke Darande (@GonjeshkeDarand) June 18, 2025 The breach took place amid heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel. The hack occurred on the fifth day of open conflict, which included strategic missile strikes exchanged by both countries. It also marks the largest cyber-related damage to Iran’s crypto sector since the beginning of its digital finance expansion. Nobitex, for its part, stated on Thursday that no further losses had occurred and that it was working to restore services within five days. The company cited internet instability inside Iran as a key challenge to its recovery timeline. CEO Amir Rad is expected to issue a video address to update users on the next steps. In response to the hack, Iran’s central bank has introduced a curfew on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges , restricting operational hours to 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., according to data referenced by Chainalysis. Crypto Market Bleeds $200B Amid Iran-Israel Conflict The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran triggered a sharp dip in crypto market confidence, with sentiment dropping over 30% between June 12–15, according to Santiment.

Analysts attribute this resilience to steady ETF inflows and the lack of further military escalation. A similar pattern was observed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where Bitcoin dipped briefly before recovering. Geopolitical crises continue to influence crypto volatility, with Bitcoin often following a “drop then stabilize” cycle. As tensions persist in the Middle East, markets may see further short-term price swings, though the long-term trajectory remains uncertain.

2025-06-19T10:17:07,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 19, 2025","The crypto market is down today, but the situation has improved since yesterday. Nearly 30 of the top 100 coins have recorded increases over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.3% over the past day, now standing at $3.38 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is $101 billion, somewhat lower than the levels observed in the last two days. TLDR: The crypto market has seen a mixed picture amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions; BTC and ETH are largely unchanged over the past day, both experienced choppy trading; Ethereum fell from the daily high to the intraday low of $2,464, recuperating since; The US Fed meeting brought no changes, but rising inflation is possible and would be a mixed bag for crypto.; ”Equity indices may enter a period of consolidation in the coming month, a dynamic that could also be reflected in Bitcoin’s price behavior”; Both US spot BTC and ETH ETFs recorded inflows for multiple consecutive days; The dip is still likely to be affected by the US involvement in Israel’s attack on Iran. Crypto Winners & Losers Four of the top 10 coins per market cap are red and four are green today (not taking the two stablecoins into account), but most are up/down below 0.5%, meaning that they are practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 0.1%, meaning it hasn’t really changed since this time yesterday, now trading at $104,812. Also, Ethereum (ETH) has increased by 0.1%, therefore also standing unchanged at $2,524. XRP (XRP) saw the highest increase in this category of just 0.4%, to the price of $2.16. The highest decrease is Solana (SOL)’s 1.3% to $145. Moreover, unlike yesterday, when only two of the top 100 coins saw their prices rise, 30 have increased today. Kaia (KAIA) is the best performer for the second day in a row, having increased by 9% to $0.1779, followed by Sei (SEI)’s 7.8% to $0.1836. At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) recorded the highest decrease today, falling 5.4% to the price of $37.93. As for Kaia (formerly Klaytn ), the L1 chain announced support for USDT in May. A few days ago, it revealed that an increasing number of wallets and CEXs support USDT on Kaia. Yesterday, the team announced Kaia Hub , saying it’s an all-in-one gateway to the chain.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers are “well positioned to wait” on rates. Powell “noted that uncertainty has diminished and that the Federal Reserve expects inflation to move toward its target in the coming months,” commented Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler . But “the broader macroeconomic landscape suggests that geopolitical tensions and tariff policies could still exert upward pressure on U.S. inflation.” Rising inflation is a mixed bag for crypto. While crypto, particularly BTC, can be seen as a hedge against inflation, an increase in inflation can also result in rising interest rates. This subsequently can turn investors’ attention away from digital currencies. Powell “aimed to reinforce confidence in the disinflationary trend,” and he “emphasized the overall strength of the U.S. economy,” Lienkha says. This “provides the Fed with the flexibility to maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. Markets interpreted these remarks as somewhat mixed, with a potentially hawkish undertone.” Therefore, “as a result, equity indices may enter a period of consolidation in the coming month, a dynamic that could also be reflected in Bitcoin’s price behavior.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,812, unchanged since this time yesterday. It has seen quite a choppy 24 hours, more turbulent than we’ve seen it in a while. It attempted to hold the $105,000 level several times, but ultimately failed. In the same period, it fell to the $103,830 level several times, but managed to recover. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Similarly to BTC, it had had a few choppy hours before finding a more stable range over the past few fours. The price saw an intraday low of $2,471, while it also hit an intraday high of $2,541. Moreover, as the market in general, the crypto market sentiment is also unchanged today. The Fear and Greed Index still stands at 48 . As the fear increases, so do the buying chances, but the sentiment still has room to return to the greed territory.

BlackRock recorded $278.93 million, and Fidelity took in $104.38 million. The cumulative total net inflow is $46.65 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $19.1 million . BlackRock saw $15.11 million, and Grayscale saw $3.99 million. The cumulative total net inflow rose to $3.91 billion. Meanwhile, Canadian digital asset firm Sol Strategies filed for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as part of its US market expansion strategy. Also in the US, Senator Cynthia Lummis is putting pressure on Congress to fast-track clear crypto legislation following the Senate’s approval of the GENIUS Act on Tuesday. While this approval brought the country “one step closer to being a welcoming home for digital assets,” Congress still needs to pass market structure legislation as a whole in order to make the US the global “crypto capital,” Lummis argued. Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill @POTUS ' vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world. pic.twitter.com/tyz6Kbc5qK — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 18, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market has been red over the last day, while the stock markets have seen quite a mixed picture. The S&P 500 went down by 0.031%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.0028%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.1%. This is the response to the US Federal Reserve not changing interest rates as economic uncertainty persists. Investors continue to monitor developments in the Middle East. Is this dip sustainable? The dip may continue over the short term, based on the current geopolitical and economic turbulence. A continuation of the rally is possible, prompted by regulatory developments, but the overall global situation may drag the prices lower as investors seek stable footing.

2025-06-19T10:10:00,"Lion Group Unlocks Massive $600M for HYPE Token Crypto Treasury Strategy","BitcoinWorld Lion Group Unlocks Massive $600M for HYPE Token Crypto Treasury Strategy In a significant move signalling the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, Lion Group Holding , a Nasdaq-listed investment and financial services firm, has made headlines. The company recently announced securing a substantial $600 million facility. This isn’t just standard corporate financing; the purpose behind this massive capital injection is particularly noteworthy for the crypto space. Lion Group intends to leverage this funding to launch an ambitious Crypto Treasury strategy, placing a specific, and perhaps unexpected, digital asset at its core: the HYPE Token . What is Lion Group’s Bold New Crypto Treasury Strategy? A corporate treasury strategy traditionally involves managing a company’s financial assets, cash flow, and risk. Companies hold reserves to ensure liquidity, fund operations, and potentially generate returns on idle capital. Historically, these reserves are held in conservative assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or money market funds. However, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, some forward-thinking companies are exploring the inclusion of digital assets in their treasury holdings. This is what Lion Group is embarking upon with its newly secured $600 million. Their strategy is centered around accumulating specific cryptocurrencies as primary or supplementary reserve assets. This approach aims to potentially benefit from the growth potential of digital assets, diversify holdings beyond traditional instruments, and perhaps even use these assets for future operational purposes or investments within the digital economy. The decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity like Lion Group to allocate such a significant sum towards a Crypto Treasury strategy underscores a growing acceptance and exploration of digital assets within mainstream finance. It’s a strategic pivot that acknowledges the evolving financial landscape and the potential role cryptocurrencies can play beyond speculative trading. Why the Focus on the HYPE Token? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Lion Group ‘s announcement is the prominent role designated for the HYPE Token . According to the report, the company plans to accumulate HYPE as a “primary reserve asset.” This is a strong statement, suggesting a significant allocation and a belief in the token’s long-term value proposition or utility. While the original snippet doesn’t detail the specifics of the HYPE Token itself – its purpose, technology, or market position – the fact that a traditional financial firm is choosing it as a core treasury asset alongside more established names is remarkable. Several reasons could drive such a decision: Belief in Underlying Project: Lion Group may have conducted extensive due diligence on the HYPE project and its team, believing in its future success and adoption. Utility and Ecosystem: The HYPE Token might have specific utility within an ecosystem or platform that Lion Group believes will grow, increasing demand and value for the token. Strategic Partnership: There could be an undisclosed strategic relationship between Lion Group and the HYPE project team. Risk/Reward Assessment: While potentially higher risk than Bitcoin or Ethereum, Lion Group might see a significant upside potential in HYPE that justifies its inclusion as a “primary” asset in their Digital Asset Strategy . Choosing HYPE as a primary asset, as opposed to merely holding Bitcoin or Ethereum, suggests a deeper conviction in this specific token’s potential trajectory or its strategic fit within Lion Group’s broader business objectives. This focus on the HYPE Token distinguishes Lion Group’s approach from other corporate treasury allocations seen in the past. Expanding the Digital Asset Strategy Beyond HYPE While the HYPE Token is the stated primary focus, Lion Group ‘s Digital Asset Strategy is not limited to just one token. The company also plans to expand its treasury portfolio to include SOL (Solana) and SUI . The inclusion of SOL and SUI provides diversification within the crypto holdings and indicates an interest in established, high-throughput blockchain ecosystems. SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, is a major player known for its speed and scalability, supporting a vast ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. SUI is the native token of the Sui blockchain, a newer layer 1 platform developed by former Meta employees, also focused on scalability and enabling rich on-chain assets and dApps. Including these tokens alongside HYPE suggests a multi-faceted approach: Balancing Risk: SOL and SUI are generally more established and liquid than many smaller altcoins, potentially offering a degree of stability compared to a heavy concentration in HYPE alone. Exposure to Different Ecosystems: Holding SOL and SUI gives Lion Group exposure to different blockchain technologies and their respective growth trajectories and use cases. Potential for Yield or Utility: These assets might be held purely for price appreciation, or Lion Group could explore opportunities to stake them for yield or utilize them within their respective ecosystems if it aligns with their business model. This broader inclusion of SOL and SUI demonstrates that Lion Group’s Digital Asset Strategy is designed to capture potential value across different segments of the crypto market, not just focus on a single, potentially high-growth, asset like HYPE. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Growing Trend? Lion Group ‘s $600 million allocation for a Crypto Treasury strategy is a powerful example of the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Investment . For years, cryptocurrencies were primarily the domain of retail investors and crypto-native funds. However, in recent cycles, we’ve seen increasing interest and participation from traditional financial institutions, publicly traded companies, and large asset managers. Several factors are driving this shift: Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies have led institutions to seek alternative stores of value. Search for Yield and Growth: In a low-interest-rate environment (at times) and with volatile traditional markets, the high growth potential of crypto assets becomes more attractive. Increased Infrastructure: The development of better custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and financial products (like Bitcoin ETFs) has made it easier and safer for institutions to access crypto. Market Maturation: As the crypto market grows, its liquidity increases, and regulatory clarity (while still evolving) improves in some jurisdictions, making it a more viable asset class for large players. Lion Group’s move adds another data point to this trend, particularly notable because they are a financial services firm themselves, suggesting a deeper understanding and integration of digital assets into their core business philosophy, beyond just holding Bitcoin. Their focus on specific altcoins like HYPE, SOL, and SUI also indicates that institutional interest is broadening beyond just the largest cryptocurrencies. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Lion Group Launching a Crypto Treasury strategy comes with both significant potential benefits and notable challenges. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: If HYPE, SOL, and SUI perform well, the value of Lion Group’s treasury holdings could increase substantially, boosting their balance sheet. Diversification: Digital assets offer diversification away from traditional financial markets. Strategic Positioning: Building expertise and holdings in digital assets positions Lion Group for future opportunities in the evolving financial landscape, potentially enabling them to offer crypto-related services themselves. Inflation Hedge: Some view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation, though this is debated and can vary by asset. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings, which could lead to significant losses on the treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing compliance risks and potential future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for crypto holdings can be complex under current standards. Liquidity Risk: While SOL is highly liquid, the liquidity of HYPE might be lower, making large transactions challenging without impacting the price. Lion Group, as a financial services firm, likely has a sophisticated understanding of risk management. Their decision to proceed suggests they believe the potential rewards of their Digital Asset Strategy outweigh the inherent risks, especially with a dedicated $600 million facility specifically for this purpose. Actionable Insights and Market Impact What does Lion Group ‘s move mean for the average reader or investor? Validation of Institutional Interest: This is another piece of evidence that institutions are serious about exploring and adopting crypto. It could encourage other firms to follow suit. Potential Impact on HYPE, SOL, SUI: Significant buying pressure from a large institution like Lion Group could positively impact the prices of HYPE, SOL, and SUI, particularly HYPE given its designation as a “primary” asset. Investors interested in these tokens should monitor Lion Group’s activities (to the extent they are publicly disclosed). Observe Treasury Strategies: Pay attention to how other companies are incorporating crypto into their balance sheets. This trend is still nascent but growing. Understand the ‘Why’: Rather than just following institutional money blindly, try to understand *why* firms like Lion Group are making these moves. What are the perceived benefits and risks they are evaluating? The announcement, reported by Cointelegraph on X, highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and its increasing interaction with traditional finance. It suggests that institutional engagement is moving beyond just Bitcoin and is starting to consider a broader range of digital assets for various strategic purposes, including corporate treasuries. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital Frontier Lion Group ‘s decision to secure a $600 million facility specifically for a Crypto Treasury strategy, with a significant focus on the HYPE Token alongside established assets like SOL and SUI, marks a bold and strategic step. It signifies a strong belief in the future role of digital assets within corporate finance and positions Lion Group as an early mover among Nasdaq-listed financial services firms in this specific type of Institutional Crypto Investment . While the success of this Digital Asset Strategy will depend on market conditions, the performance of the chosen assets, and effective risk management, the move itself is a powerful indicator of the ongoing maturation and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative instruments, but as legitimate components of a diversified financial portfolio, even at the corporate treasury level. The coming months will be crucial in observing how this strategy unfolds and what impact it has on Lion Group and the tokens involved, particularly the intriguing focus on the HYPE Token .

In its policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed its goal of achieving maximum employment and returning inflation to the 2% target. The central bank also released its quarterly economic projections, including the closely watched dot plot. Officials maintained their outlook for two rate cuts totalling 50 basis points by the end of the year, in line with projections from March. Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions—particularly those surrounding the Iran-Israel conflict—continue to contribute to market uncertainty. Against this backdrop, regulatory developments have provided a measure of support. Regulatory clarity is increasingly seen as essential for broader adoption, especially for infrastructure-focused and early-stage tokens. Projects such as Bitcoin Pepe could be positioned to benefit from the evolving regulatory environment. Ohio House passes crypto bill Ohio’s House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at making it easier for residents to use cryptocurrency for everyday transactions, pushing forward one of the state’s most notable pro-crypto efforts to date. The Ohio Blockchain Basics Act, or HB 116, cleared the House in a 70–26 vote on Wednesday, a day after it advanced through the Technology and Innovation Committee, according to the state legislature’s website. The bill now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. If enacted, HB 116 would prohibit local governments from imposing additional taxes or fees on the use of cryptocurrency for legal goods and services. It would also exempt transactions under $200 from capital gains tax. In addition, the bill contains provisions to protect crypto mining operations from discriminatory regulatory action, reinforcing Ohio’s intention to be a hospitable environment for digital asset businesses. Ohio joins a growing list of US states pursuing legislation to integrate crypto into payments infrastructure and state treasury management. Bitcoin Pepe is riding the broader crypto wave The growing regulatory clarity in the US is expected to provide long-overdue visibility for altcoins and meme coins, potentially altering how investors evaluate these assets. As oversight increases, the market may begin to prioritise credible, utility-focused narratives over pure speculation. In this shifting environment, technically ambitious projects like Bitcoin Pepe could gain legitimacy. Positioned at the intersection of cultural relevance and infrastructure innovation, Bitcoin Pepe aims to bridge the divide between meme appeal and real-world functionality. Unlike most meme tokens that rely exclusively on hype and community momentum, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a defined technical roadmap and an infrastructure-oriented narrative. This positioning has resonated with investors, helping the project raise nearly $15 million through its ongoing presale. According to the team, Bitcoin Pepe ’s BPEP token will be listed on MEXC and BitMart. A move that is expected to enhance the token’s visibility, liquidity, and credibility ahead of a broader rollout. Adding to investor anticipation, the project is also expected to make another listing announcement on June 30.

2025-06-19T10:00:25,"Bitcoin Channel Break Below $105,000 Sparks Panic, Analysts Predict Further Crashes","Bitcoin has been crashing with the advent of the new week, spurred on by uncertainties that surround the growing conflict in the Middle East. There has also been a lot of negativity in the crypto market, with expectations that the Bitcoin price will not make new all-time highs after failing to reclaim $111,000. Even as the market continues to bleed, crypto analysts are still predicting further crashes for the digital asset, with some expecting a break of the psychological level at $100,000. Bitcoin Price Headed For Further Breakdown Crypto analyst TehThomas had previously called the Bitcoin price crash from the $108,000 territory, suggesting that the digital asset still had to fill Fair Value Gaps (FVG) at lower levels before it could continue to soar. Then recently, the crypto analyst has once again reiterated his stance as the price had begun to fall back toward $100.000. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge – Is A Major Move Coming? Thomas explained that Bitcoin was already showing signs of exhaustion. Hence, the reason for the crash was due to a loss of $108,500. At this level, with the price failing to break out higher, it showed that the initial surge had been a takeout, and the right direction was actually downward. The initial bullish move was seemingly a way for an internal liquidity grab while clearing out breakout buyers at the same time. Now, the Bitcoin price has broken below an important channel at $105,000 after a successful retest. The analyst explains that this aligns with the 50% equilibrium of the high-to-low range. Naturally, this means that the asset is still bearish and could continue to decline from here. The main levels to watch were initially at $104,600, but the Bitcoin price had first broken below this level on Tuesday. Now, if the decline continues, then the next major level investors are looking at is the $102,800, where support now lies for the cryptocurrency. Below $100,000 Is Still Possible In addition to Thomas, crypto analyst Xanrox has also predicted further price crashes for Bitcoin. He points out that the formation of a bull flag does not mean the price will continue to rise, as the flag could very well break. If this happens, then the analyst sees the Bitcoin price dropping to $100,000. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why Unlike Thomas, Xanrox places his support levels at the much lower price of $88,000, which would suggest a major price crash from here. “When we look at the current price action, it looks like a bullish flag consolidation pattern,” the analyst said. “In this case we will probably see multiple liquidity sweeps below the previous swing lows to kick out early longs.” Another analyst, Doctor Profit, has also turned bearish, predicting a decline below $100,000. In the X post, the crypto analyst said that the Bitcoin price is likely to fall to the $94,000-$95,000 level before seeing a bounce from there. Therefore, the analyst has told investors to prepare for more red candles.

2025-06-19T10:00:21,"Best crypto to buy now as the US Fed keep rates steady","Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) saw modest movements on Thursday, with the crypto market showing resilience after the Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50%. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions continue to escalate amid the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, President Donald Trump declined to confirm whether he had decided to support Israel’s military campaign. “I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do,” he said. Trump later added that Iranian officials had expressed interest in meeting in Washington, saying, “We may do that.” However, he noted, “It’s a little late” for such talks. Separately, the foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are scheduled to meet with their Iranian counterpart on Friday in Geneva, according to a German diplomatic source cited by Reuters. The talks aim to secure firm assurances from Iran that its nuclear program will remain strictly for civilian purposes. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had approved military strike plans against Iran but was holding off on issuing the final order, pending signs that Tehran might abandon its nuclear ambitions. In this volatile environment, some investors are moving to early-stage assets that have shown resilience. One such project is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has raised over $1 million in the past week. Fed keeps rates steady The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% during its June policy meeting on Wednesday, meeting market expectations. Policymakers noted that the Committee will maintain plans to achieve maximum employment and lower inflation to its long-term target of 2%. The Fed also indicated that the Committee is prepared to adjust its monetary policy stance as needed if emerging risks threaten progress toward its economic objectives. Alongside its benchmark rate decision, the Fed also released its quarterly economic projections. This includes the dot plot, which outlines policymakers’ rate forecasts, showing that officials still expect at least two rate cuts totalling 50 basis points by the end of the year, in line with the outlook in March. However, the Fed now projects rates falling to 3.6% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027, signalling a slower pace of rate cuts than previously anticipated. During his speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that policymakers are eager to maintain their wait-and-see approach before considering a rate cut. Bitcoin Pepe presale hits milestone While the Federal Reserve held rates steady, its projection of two potential cuts later this year has provided a measure of reassurance to markets. In this environment, investors seeking asymmetric upside — even while remaining cautious — are increasingly turning to projects like Bitcoin Pepe, which combines viral internet culture with a credible Layer 2 infrastructure narrative. Positioned as an effort to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” Bitcoin Pepe aims to fuse the base-layer security of the Bitcoin network with the scalability and transaction speed typically associated with Solana. This approach sets it apart from meme tokens that depend solely on community-driven momentum. To reinforce its legitimacy, the team has also released images highlighting the technical progress underway. The project has gained significant traction during its ongoing presale, raising over $15 million to date. According to the team, the BPEP token is slated to list on MEXC and BitMart—an important step expected to improve visibility, boost liquidity, and enhance the project’s perceived credibility ahead of a broader market debut. A key listing announcement is scheduled for June 30, further stoking investor anticipation. With risk appetite returning across the crypto landscape, Bitcoin Pepe appears well-positioned to benefit from renewed speculative inflows as it approaches the final phase of its token sale.

2025-06-19T10:00:08,"Analyst Warns: Strategy On Track For Historic Collapse, Bigger Than FTX","In a bold and alarming statement, on-chain analyst OxChain raised the possibility of a catastrophic collapse involving Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Michael Saylor. According to OxChain, this potential downfall could surpass the infamous collapse of FTX. ‘Strategy’s Bitcoin Tactics Resemble Ponzi Scheme’ In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), OxChain expressed concerns about Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation formula, suggesting that the company’s operations resemble a Ponzi scheme. OxChain pointed out that since 2020, MicroStrategy has transformed from a traditional software company into a significant player in the Bitcoin market, currently holding around 582,000 BTC, valued at nearly $61 billion. Related Reading: Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand However, OxChain claims that this impressive figure is underpinned by leverage, debt, and shareholder dilution, rather than genuine conviction in the cryptocurrency. The analyst outlined Strategy’s approach as a “cyclical financial loop”: the firm raises capital through shares or bonds, purchases Bitcoin, announces these purchases to drive up stock prices, and then raises more funds. The analyst asserts that this cycle has worked as long as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise. However, with plans for a new $1 billion share sale, OxChain believes that Strategy is increasing its risk exposure. Analyst Predicts Major Liquidation Risk OxChain warns that Strategy’s average cost per Bitcoin is approximately $70,000, creating a precarious situation. The analyst adds that if Bitcoin’s price falls significantly below this level, the company’s treasury, currently valued at around $25 billion, could quickly start to suffer losses. According to the analyst, despite Saylor’s public commitment to never sell Bitcoin, the realities of accounting and risk management may force the company to act if market conditions deteriorate. In the first quarter of 2025, Strategy disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, revealing the volatility of its assets. Under the new accounting standard ASC 350-60, the company is required to report fair value, eliminating the ability to hide behind book value. This transparency has already led to legal repercussions, with shareholders filing a class action lawsuit alleging that Strategy concealed the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility while aggressively raising capital. OxChain further claimed during his social media thread that Strategy’s role as a Bitcoin access point is diminishing, especially as institutional capital flows into “more transparent and regulated options,” such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed around $70 billion in assets under management. The analyst stressed that unlike Strategy, which reportedly faces dilution risks and operates with limited safeguards, IBIT offers a “more stable investment” for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season If Strategy were to falter, the implications would be far-reaching, OxChain added. The firm holds approximately 2.77% of Bitcoin’s total supply, and a significant liquidation could send shockwaves through the market. The analyst warns that a decline in Bitcoin’s price by just 22% from its average buy price could trigger corporate liquidations, potentially leading to one of the largest liquidation events in history. Ultimately, OxChain cautions that Strategy is neither a hero nor a villain in the crypto ecosystem; instead, he said that it represents a “risk vector heavily reliant on leverage and market sentiment.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-warns-strategy-on-track-for-historic-collapse-bigger-than-ftx/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto news|Michael Saylor|Microstrategy|MicroStrategy Bitcoin|MicroStrategy bitcoin holdings|MicroStrategy news|Strategy",cryptocompare
2025-06-19T09:58:07,"It's Bull Time for Bitcoin (BTC) and Gold, Bear Time for Fiat Currency! Bitwise Explains Why!","The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has seen a huge increase in institutional adoption in recent months. While many companies are buying Bitcoin at this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin hoarding race. Related News: Huge BTC Move Comes From The Company That Consults The Person Who Convinced Donald Trump About Bitcoin! While the increase in institutional adoption is notable, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan spoke about the demand for BTC. Matt Hougan argued that investors globally are now questioning the future of the fiat currency system and have begun to turn to Bitcoin and gold as safe havens. Hougan said he believes the world is beginning to question the very foundations of the fiat currency system that has defined the modern economy since the early 1970s. Stating that the fiat currency system is no longer stable and secure at this point, Hougan said that central banks are turning to gold to protect against currency depreciation, while investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a digital alternative. The Bitwise CIO said that central banks, which were routine buyers of gold before 1971, abandoned the gold narrative and entered a period of unlimited money printing, but started buying gold again after the 2008 financial crisis due to growing concerns about fiat money. Pointing out that Bitcoin purchases with gold have also increased recently, Hougan said that a total of $45 billion has been invested in Bitcoin ETFs as of January 2024, while only $34 billion has been invested in gold ETFs in the same period. At this point, Hougan added, traditional portfolio strategies are now risky. Finally, Hougan noted that Bitcoin will emerge as a modern store of value as inflation concerns rise and trust in government-issued currencies decline, further reinforcing the need for investors to include alternatives like Bitcoin and gold in their portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

Together, the posts have added fresh fuel to the Bitcoin conversation, drawing in both long-time believers and curious onlookers. Here’s what’s behind the latest Bitcoin buzz. Max Keiser’s ‘Satoshi’ Post Sparks Crypto Reactions Max Keiser, well-known Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, shared a cryptic post on X. It featured a GIF of a hooded figure kneeling before a sword embedded in stone – strongly resembling the legend of King Arthur and Excalibur. The post carried just one word: “Satoshi.” The tweet quickly grabbed attention. Some users called Satoshi Nakamoto a “deity,” while others took the image as a symbol of Bitcoin’s role in challenging a broken financial system. Satoshi pic.twitter.com/qezco1kjRF — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 18, 2025 One user wrote: “He created Excalibur, which, like Bitcoin, conquers the monetary establishment.” Whether a tribute to Bitcoin’s creator or a deeper message, the tweet added another layer to the ongoing mystery around Satoshi Nakamoto and sparked a wave of discussion. Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million Adding more to this, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki made a shocking prediction: Bitcoin could be trading at $1 million per coin by 2030. PRICE vs QUANTITY Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity. I do not care much about the spot price of gold or silver. I do care about how many ounces of gold and silver I control.

While I watch the price of Bitcoin I focus on how many… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 18, 2025 Kiyosaki said he started buying Bitcoin when it was just $6,000 and continues to stack it. He emphasized that it’s not about the current price – it’s about how much Bitcoin, gold, and silver you own. In another tweet, he pointed to his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy , where he warned of a major financial crash. He believes that collapse is now happening. With AI threatening jobs and many retirees seeing their savings wiped out, Kiyosaki’s advice is simple: “Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Back in the Spotlight Keiser’s eerie GIF and Kiyosaki’s bold forecast have once again pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight – this time as both a cultural symbol and a hedge against economic chaos.

2025-06-19T09:50:30,"Geopolitical Risk: Looming Middle East Tensions Could Trigger Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Looming Middle East Tensions Could Trigger Crypto Market Impact The world of finance, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market, is often a reflection of global events. When tensions rise in critical regions, investors pay close attention. Recent reports citing foreign media via Odaily suggest the U.S. is considering a significant military action: a strike on Iran, potentially targeting the Fordow nuclear facility, as early as this weekend. This development introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into an already complex global landscape. Understanding the Source of `Middle East Tensions` What exactly is fueling these concerns? The reports stem from foreign media outlets, relayed by Odaily, indicating a potential U.S. military response targeting Iran. While specifics remain fluid and official confirmation is awaited, the focus on a key nuclear site like Fordow underscores the gravity of the situation. The Middle East has long been a region prone to volatility, and any direct military confrontation between major powers like the U.S. and Iran would represent a significant escalation of existing Middle East Tensions . This isn’t just about two countries; the implications ripple outwards, affecting international relations, energy markets, and global finance. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core elements based on the report: The Report: U.S. reportedly considering a strike on Iran. Potential Timing: As early as this weekend. Primary Target (Reported): Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility. Source: Foreign media reports, cited by Odaily. It’s crucial to remember that these are reports and considerations, not confirmed plans. However, the mere possibility is enough to inject uncertainty into markets. Why Does `Geopolitical Risk` Matter for Markets? Geopolitical events, especially those involving potential conflict in strategically important regions, have a profound impact on financial markets. Why? Because they create uncertainty. Investors dislike uncertainty. They struggle to price in outcomes when the future is suddenly unpredictable. Geopolitical Risk can manifest in several ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can disrupt trade routes, energy supplies, and production, leading to price hikes and shortages. Increased Government Spending & Debt: Military actions require significant resources, potentially leading to increased national debt and inflationary pressures. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Fear and panic can lead to rapid sell-offs in perceived risky assets and a flight to safety. Sanctions and Economic Warfare: Governments may impose sanctions, impacting international trade and financial flows. Historically, major geopolitical events have often triggered periods of intense market volatility. Think back to events like the start of conflicts, major political crises, or terrorist attacks. While the long-term impact varies, the immediate reaction is almost always one of heightened caution and price swings. Direct `Crypto Market Impact`: How Could a Strike Affect Digital Assets? While the crypto market operates differently from traditional markets, it is not immune to global events. The potential for a U.S. strike on Iran and the resulting escalation of Middle East Tensions could have a notable Crypto Market Impact . Here’s how: Sentiment Shift: Global fear and uncertainty often lead investors to reduce exposure to assets perceived as high-risk, which cryptocurrencies sometimes are, despite arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven. Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell crypto assets to raise cash or cover losses in other markets. Safe Haven Narrative Test: Some argue Bitcoin is a digital safe haven akin to gold. Geopolitical crises test this narrative. Demand for Bitcoin *could* increase if investors truly see it as uncorrelated to traditional risks, but it could also fall if the overall risk-off sentiment dominates. Increased Use in Sanctioned Regions: Paradoxically, increased sanctions against Iran or other involved parties could potentially increase the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, though this is a complex and often debated topic with regulatory implications. The immediate Crypto Market Impact is likely to be negative volatility driven by fear, followed by a period where the ‘safe haven’ narrative is either reinforced or weakened depending on how investors react globally. Will This Impact `Bitcoin Price`? As the leading cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Price is often the primary indicator of the broader market’s reaction to macroeconomic and geopolitical events. A potential U.S. strike on Iran is highly likely to impact the Bitcoin Price , at least in the short term. Here are potential scenarios for the Bitcoin Price : Scenario Potential Bitcoin Price Reaction Reasoning Immediate Escalation & Fear Sharp Decline Risk-off sentiment dominates; investors sell perceived risky assets. Conflict Contained / De-escalation Recovery / Stabilisation Uncertainty decreases; market focuses on other factors. Protracted Conflict / Broad Instability Mixed / Potential Long-Term Decline Sustained global economic uncertainty outweighs specific crypto narratives. Bitcoin as Safe Haven (Strong Adoption) Potential Increase Investors flock to Bitcoin as an alternative asset uncorrelated to traditional markets (less likely for immediate, sharp conflict). In most immediate conflict scenarios, initial reactions tend towards risk aversion, which historically has put downward pressure on Bitcoin Price . However, the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ means that sustained geopolitical instability *could* eventually drive demand if traditional safe havens are perceived as insufficient or if confidence in fiat currencies wavers. The key challenge is the unpredictable nature of both the geopolitical event and the market’s reaction. Navigating `Financial Market Volatility`: Strategies for Crypto Investors Given the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility stemming from rising Middle East Tensions and broader Geopolitical Risk , what can crypto investors do? While no strategy guarantees protection, here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much potential loss you can withstand. Geopolitical events can cause significant, rapid price swings. Reduce Leverage: Highly leveraged positions are extremely vulnerable to sudden volatility. Consider reducing or closing leveraged trades. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset. While crypto may react in tandem, diversification across different asset classes (including traditional ones, if appropriate for you) can help mitigate overall portfolio risk. Have a Plan: Decide in advance how you will react to different market movements. Will you sell, hold, or buy the dip? Stick to your plan rather than making impulsive decisions based on fear. Stay Informed (Critically): Follow reliable news sources but be wary of sensationalism. Understand the potential implications without panicking. Consider Stablecoins: Moving a portion of your portfolio into stablecoins can preserve capital during periods of extreme volatility, allowing you to re-enter the market later. Managing Financial Market Volatility requires discipline and a long-term perspective. Short-term reactions to geopolitical news can be severe, but markets often recover or adjust over time. Beyond the Headlines: Long-Term Implications Should the reported potential strike occur, or should Middle East Tensions escalate significantly, the long-term implications for the global economy and financial markets could be substantial. This includes potential shifts in global alliances, increased defense spending, sustained energy price volatility, and potentially accelerated adoption of alternative financial systems if confidence in traditional ones is shaken. The Crypto Market Impact in such a scenario would evolve beyond immediate price reactions, potentially influencing regulatory approaches, institutional adoption timelines, and the perceived utility of cryptocurrencies in a more fragmented or unstable world. While the immediate focus is on the potential for increased Financial Market Volatility and its effect on Bitcoin Price due to rising Geopolitical Risk , smart investors will also consider how these events might shape the landscape for digital assets in the years to come. Compelling Summary Reports suggesting a potential U.S. strike on Iran this weekend have introduced a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk and heightened Middle East Tensions . Such events are notorious triggers for Financial Market Volatility across the board, and the cryptocurrency market, including the Bitcoin Price , is unlikely to be spared. While the ultimate Crypto Market Impact remains uncertain and depends heavily on the scope and duration of any conflict, investors should prepare for potential turbulence. Understanding the risks, having a clear strategy, and avoiding impulsive reactions are crucial steps for navigating these uncertain times. Geopolitical events underscore the interconnectedness of global finance and the importance of risk management in the volatile world of digital assets.

""What They're Doing Is Dangerous, It Will Eventually Hurt Bitcoin!""","Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, one of the vocal advocates of Bitcoin, made new statements. Accordingly, Anthony Scaramucci criticized companies issuing debt instruments to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) for their corporate treasuries. The famous CEO warned that this strategy would become obsolete, describing it as a risky trend that could harm Bitcoin. “This is Risky, Bitcoin Will Suffer Damage!” Speaking at the DigiAssets 2025 conference, Scaramucci argued that it was dangerous for companies to start buying Bitcoin in the style of Michael Saylor's company MicroStrategy (Strategy). “I don’t think it’s right for companies to buy BTC by issuing debt for their corporate reserves. But this happens all the time in our industry and it feels like SPACs. “I'm worried that this could eventually create a rift and hurt Bitcoin.” While borrowing money to buy Bitcoin is currently the most popular thing to do, “it will become obsolete and it will hurt Bitcoin,” Scaramcci said. We Think Differently with Michael Saylor! While the views that Bitcoin is digital gold are increasing day by day, Scaramucci said that he is among those who think that Bitcoin is digital gold. Stating that he thinks differently from Michael Saylor on this point, Scaramucci said that Saylor sees Bitcoin as digital property. At this point, although Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Saylor are optimistic about the Bitcoin price, Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin is “digital gold”; Saylor believes that Bitcoin is a “digital asset” with a potential value of $5 trillion. “For me, Bitcoin is digital gold and that is why I think it will be traded according to market value of gold. “If Michael Saylor was here, he would say, 'No, this is digital property, it's going to be tied to the rest of the world's property.' He thinks Bitcoin will be a $500 trillion asset. I think it's going to be a $24 or $25 trillion asset.” While Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin purchases have been closely monitored by the market, analysts at The Kobeissi Letter noted that a forced liquidation scenario for Strategy due to its BTC purchases is very unlikely. However, they added that there is a small risk of liquidation. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Famous CEO's Much-Talked-About Bitcoin (BTC) Criticism!

2025-06-19T09:27:55,"Trump slams Powell’s rate stance as BTC price flatlines","President Trump slams Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates, leaving America’s monetary policy unchanged again. As a result, Bitcoin has seen minimal price movement ever since. In a recent post shared to Trump Media & Technology Group-owned social media platform Truth Social, President Donald Trump did not hold back from harshly criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s unwavering stance towards interest rates. “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!” wrote Trump in his post . Not only that, he also included a link to an article published on the National Mortgage News site , which quoted an analysis from Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s regulator who called for the Federal Reserve Chairman to quit if he continues to maintain the current interest rate. Although the decision to keep the interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% range, it has left Bitcoin ( BTC ) at a standstill. Ever since it was announced that the Fed unanimously voted to maintain its current policy in June, Bitcoin has been stuck around the $104,000 floating around the mark, seeing weak gains of only 0.28% to as low as 0.1%. It appears that the Fed’s cautionary stance has triggered a pause in Bitcoin’s previous rally, much to the dismay of traders and the President of the U.S. himself. In the past two weeks, the largest cryptocurrency has seen a slight increase of 0.3%.

On June 18, the Federal Reserve came to a unanimous decision to maintain a “wait-and-see” approach to the current monetary stance in June. According to a CNBC report , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference that policymakers are “well positioned to wait” before moving further on rates. He also said that the market is beginning to see the effects of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. “We have to learn more about tariffs. I don’t know what the right way for us to react will be,” said Jerome Powell, as quoted by CNN Business from the press conference. “I think it’s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects,” he continued. Maintaining interest rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% is considered restrictive by many, considering that it led to a fall in investor confidence. Moreover, Bloomberg reported that the Fed has also revised its economic growth forecast, showing a decline for 2025. Lower GDP projections could suggest less consumer spending, weaker investment, or global headwinds. The inflation forecast for 2025 has been raised to 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target. This signals that inflationary pressures may be more persistent than previously expected. After the Fed refused to cut interest rates and foreshadowed a bleaker economic outlook, the U.S. stocks took a dive. You might also like: Here’s how the crypto market reacted to the Fed’s 0.25% cut According to a report by Reuters , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.10% compared to the previous day. Meanwhile the S&P saw a decline of 0.03%. In contrast to the two exchanges, the Nasdaq Composite actually rose by 0.13%. However, overall stock prices were generally higher before the Fed’s announcement. On the crypto side of the market, the overall crypto market cap fell by 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The current crypto market cap stands at $3.3 trillion, after major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) saw declines ranging from 1.6% to 0.2%. Even the overall crypto trading volume suffered a 15% fall following the Fed announcement, from an initial $120 billion to $101 billion on June 19. Additionally, the CBS reported that the central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months. It also foresaw two interest rate cuts by the end of this year. This prediction is the same as its previous projection back in March. “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” said Jerome Powell. The Fed’s decision goes against increasing pressures from the White House to lower interest rated by two points. Just hours before the announcement, Trump said that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of his ongoing attacks on the Fed.

2025-06-19T09:25:42,"Bitcoin Battles for $105K Following Fed’s Decision, Altcoins Stagnate (Market Watch)","The decision regarding the general interest rates in the United States came in yesterday and the Federal Reserve didn’t really surprise the market. Bitcoin continues fighting for $105,000, going through some very moderate volatility in the interim, all the while altcoins are also stagnating. The Fed did note some changes in its economic outlook, though, so let’s take a closer look at the events that transpired throughout the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Battles for $105,000 At the time of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at around $104,800, marking a very slight increase of around 0.2% on the daily chart seen below. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency had declined to around $103,600 but the bulls were quick to intercept the move and pushed the price back towards $105K. This comes immediately after the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the general interest rates unchanged in the range between 4.25% and 4.5%. This is what the majority of the traders were expecting. In fact, according to Polymarket, there was less than 1% chance for the institution to go with a 25bps cut. Nonetheless, the FOMC update also included a few additional remarks, which do mark a slight change of tone. Most notably: Ups inflation forecast to 3% Cuts 2025 GDP forecast to 1.4% Sees 50bps in cuts this year Rates projected at 3.6% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027 At the same time, president Donald Trump continues with his hostile rhetoric towards Fed Chairman Powell, calling him “stupid,” and insisting that the country is losing billions of dollars because of the institutions refusal to cut rates. The political pressure seems to be mounting. Altcoins Stagnate Perhaps somewhat expectedly, the altcoins market is also stagnating and failed to chart any notable moves throughout the past 24 hours. As you can see in the heatmap below, most of the alternative cryptocurrencies are trading at more or less breakeven, with a few notable exceptions, of course. For example, Uniswap’s native token – UNI – managed to increase by more than 5%, defying the market slowdown, as well as OKB, which is up by almost 8%. On the other hand, Hyperliquid’s HYPE continues crashing and is down another 7% in the past 24 hours, currently trading below $38.

U.S. President Donald Trump targeting Iran’s supreme leader has sparked investor fear, leading to a sell-off in altcoins like Ether, Solana, and XRP have recorded a drop of nearly 5% to 9% in a week. If Bitcoin plunges, Altcoin will follow, thus investors are in fear of a further market crash. Trump’s Threat Triggered Crypto Sell-Off On Tuesday, Trump posted a warning on his social media , saying the U.S. knows the location of Iran’s Supreme Leader and could strike — but “not for now.” These words were enough to shake investor’s confidence worldwide. Soon after this post, Bitcoin dropped quickly from $108,952 to $103,371 before bouncing back slightly to $104,950 . Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, also fell. Ether lost 1.5%, dropping from $2,618 to $2,462 before recovering to $2,526. Meanwhile, Solana and XRP dropped over 2% in 24 hours. However, Cardano, SUI, and Dogecoin saw even bigger losses of over 10% to 12% for the week. Fed’s Warning Adds More Caution On top of geopolitical worries, the U.S. Federal Reserve added more concerns . Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that global conflict and new tariffs could make inflation worse. Although interest rates stayed the same, Powell made it clear that the Fed isn’t ready to lower them yet. Bitcoin Stuck Between Roles As tensions rose, many investors shifted their funds into stablecoins or held on to Bitcoin, viewing them as safer compared to altcoins. Despite this, BTC hasn’t acted fully like a safe-haven asset like gold, nor has it rallied like risk assets. While Bitcoin is up 60% in the last 1 year, analysts say it’s still unclear which direction it’ll take next.

According to the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) , the media and PR relations wing of the Pakistan armed forces, both the heads discussed economic development and crypto. “Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR noted. Trump Has Personal Interest in Crypto Talks The luncheon meeting took place amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran, with Trump looking for a possible US involvement. According to South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman, Trump takes a “deep personal interest” in talking crypto. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, and Counter Terrorism.” Further, diplomatic sources in Washington noted that the meeting wasn’t arranged through routine diplomatic channels. Pakistan’s daily, Dawn, reported that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation and engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, helped Pakistan secure the meeting with Trump. Meanwhile, Trump also praised both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Army chief for their roles in reducing and de-escalating tensions between India-Pakistan in May. “Prime Minister Modi just left a little while ago and we are working a trade deal with India and also with Pakistan,” Trump noted. “I am so happy. Two very smart people decided not to keep going with the war. Those are two big nuclear powers.” Pakistan’s Crypto Ambition Rises Pakistan has been mulling over several crypto advancements, including a plan to set up a Bitcoin reserve. The country’s Crypto Council noted that Bitcoin will be held and Pakistan will “ never sell them .” Interestingly, in April, Pakistan partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF) , a company linked to the US President Donald Trump’s family. Per the agreement, the collaboration will explore asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. However, details of the deal remain vague. Crypto is already widely popular in Pakistan, with around 20 million users , placing it among the top nations in crypto trading. Additionally, global crypto exchange platforms like Binance are showing interest, as Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and AI data centres. Hussain Nadeem, a policy strategist and Pakistani AI expert, said last month that Pakistan’s core interest in crypto is to gain access to the White House. “The regime has only ONE interest in Crypto: Access to Trump White House, and sadly this hype is all about that, nothing more.” Crypto is the new SIFC: The way this regime is approaching Crypto, it has unfortunately become a yet new con that has politics, not public good, as an end goal.

In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hayes says that between now and 2028, liquidity in the “realm of $9 trillion” will be injected into the US economy, initially flowing into the traditional economic sectors before trickling down to risk assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). “…And I think the banks are going to free, because they now don’t have to hold all this equity capital against their treasury book, they can lend more into the real American economy. And so you’re going to see the amount of loans going to manufacturing firms increase, which is again… that’s an increase in credit. And that will make its way into crypto as well.” The BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin could skyrocket by around 139% from the current price by the end of the year. By 2028, Hayes Bitcoin could go up nearly tenfold. “So I think that we get to $250,000 by the end of the year. It will be bumpy along the way, obviously. But that’s sort of my end-of-year price target. And then a $1 million Bitcoin.” On why Bitcoin could outperform other risk assets amid the expected injection of liquidity, Hayes says, “So Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It’s obviously a much smaller market in terms of market cap. And so you have a lot of things chasing a very small door, then the price goes up on the margin. And so that’s why Bitcoin has been the best performing financial asset in the last 15 years.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,462 at time of writing. ?

2025-06-19T09:00:29,"TRON Price Dips, But On-Chain Growth Tells a Different Story","TRON (TRX) has entered a period of downward price movement, with the asset declining steadily over recent weeks. At the time of reporting, TRX is trading at $0.2683, representing a 4% drop in the past 24 hours and nearly 10% over the past week. The current trend marks a continued break from the relatively stable price range TRON held earlier this quarter. Despite the market downturn, on-chain indicators suggest TRON’s ecosystem is still exhibiting growth in user activity and operational strength. This contrast between price performance and network fundamentals has drawn attention from analysts, including CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, who recently shared detailed insights on TRON’s blockchain dynamics via the platform’s QuickTake platform Transaction Metrics Show Long-Term Network Reliability According to Darkfost, TRON’s blockchain has seen consistent growth in daily transaction volume since 2021. From a baseline of around 2.5 million transactions per day, the figure has risen to over 9 million transactions as of recent data, signaling an increase in overall usage. Importantly, the transaction success rate has remained above 96% during this period, suggesting that the higher volume is not being driven by failed or spam-related activity, an issue that has surfaced in critiques of other high-throughput blockchains. The consistency extends to the network’s block production. Despite the uptick in transaction count, TRON has maintained a nearly linear block output over time. This indicates that the network infrastructure is able to handle increased demand without disruption, offering insights into its stability as a decentralized system. Furthermore, even in the face of higher global transaction fees, activity on the network has not declined, implying continued demand for TRON’s block space and throughput capacity. Speculation Aside, On-Chain Data Suggests Operational Strength In addition to its transactional metrics, TRX’s on-chain indicators continue to show resilience . Darkfost points out that while recent speculation around external associations, such as news involving Eric Trump or a potential Nasdaq listing , has captured headlines, the objective blockchain data is a more accurate measure of network health. Metrics like transaction success rate, throughput stability, and block production suggest that the network is functioning efficiently even in uncertain market conditions. This performance has continued amid broader developments in the TRON ecosystem, including the expansion of its DeFi services and integration of its USDT issuance platform.

2025-06-19T09:00:27,"SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5","After falling below the key $3.00 mark, SUI now retests a make-or-break level that could ignite or stall the cryptocurrency’s rally. However, some market watchers believe that the altcoin is preparing for new highs despite the recent pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For ‘Large Move’ Amid $103,000 Retest – Key Levels To Watch SUI Eyes Breakout To $5 This week, SUI fell below the $3.00 mark amid the Israel-Iran news-fueled market retrace. The cryptocurrency has seen a 7% decline over the past three days, hitting a two-month low of $2.68 on Wednesday morning before recovering. Since its late April breakout, SUI has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range, with the price hovering around the upper boundary over the past two months. Notably, the altcoin ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March, leading to its rally to the $4.00 mark. On Wednesday, analyst Crypto Bullet suggested that it could be preparing for a similar performance. According to the post, SUI broke down a falling wedge pattern before bouncing off the yearly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average (MA) between March and April, which propelled the downtrend breakout and rally to its May high. Now, the cryptocurrency is testing the EMA and MA again, while printing a new falling wedge pattern that targets the $5.00-$5.50 area. To Crypto Bullet, “This is where SUI is gonna establish a Higher Low and soon rise to a New ATH.” Earlier this month, the analyst also highlighted a one-year rising wedge pattern that eyes the $8-$10 levels as the next major target for the cryptocurrency. The high-timeframe chart shows the altcoin has been hovering between the pattern’s upper and lower boundaries since early 2024. Amid its April price action, the cryptocurrency bounced from the pattern’s support, suggesting that a surge to the resistance line will come in the coming months if history repeats. Make-Or-Break Level Retest Meanwhile, trader Coinvo noted that SUI is currently retesting a make-or-break level, the key $2.80 area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year. Holding this level is crucial for the cryptocurrency’s rally, as a drop could send the price toward the $2.33 range low and risk a potential retest of the $2.00 support. On the contrary, price stability in this area could propel a reclaim of the $3.00 barrier and a recovery of the range highs, which is necessary for a bullish rally continuation. As analyst Rekt Capital previously warned, June’s performance will be decisive for its mid-term action. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels – $2,100 Or $4,000 Next? It’s worth noting that SUI has built a re-accumulation range around the same levels as it did in late 2024. At the time, it consolidated around the $3.39-$3.78 levels for weeks before Weekly Closing above the range and setting up for its all-time high (ATH) breakout. This time, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating less cleanly than last year, failing to secure a weekly close inside the range for two consecutive weeks. SUI must reclaim the $3.39 area in the coming weeks to maintain its Monthly Bull Flag and position itself for higher levels. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.79, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-19T08:50:22,"Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: Unleashing the Power of the US Dollar and US Treasury Imagine a digital asset, born from the world of Cryptocurrency , that doesn’t just coexist with traditional finance but actively works to strengthen the bedrock of the global economy – the US Dollar . This isn’t a far-fetched concept; it’s a perspective recently highlighted by a key figure in U.S. financial policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that Stablecoins could play a significant role in reinforcing the US Dollar ’s global supremacy, primarily by becoming substantial buyers of US Treasury assets. This view from such a high-level official underscores the evolving perception of digital assets within traditional financial corridors and their potential impact on global Financial Stability . Why Does the US Treasury See Value in Stablecoins? The statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as reported by The Block, is noteworthy because it comes from an institution historically cautious about the volatile nature of Cryptocurrency . His perspective centers on a specific, often overlooked, aspect of certain Stablecoins : their reserve holdings. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US Dollar . To maintain this peg, issuers hold reserves. For the most popular dollar-pegged Stablecoins , these reserves often include highly liquid, low-risk assets – and U.S. Treasurys are a prime example. The logic is straightforward: as the market capitalization of dollar-pegged Stablecoins grows, the demand for the assets held in their reserves also increases. If a significant portion of these reserves is held in US Treasury securities, then the growth of the Stablecoin market translates directly into increased demand for U.S. government debt. This increased demand has several potential benefits for the US Treasury and the broader U.S. economy. Stablecoins and the US Dollar: A Digital Alliance? The US Dollar has long held the position of the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. This dominance provides significant economic and geopolitical advantages to the United States. In a rapidly digitizing global economy, maintaining this position requires the dollar to be easily accessible and usable in digital forms. While discussions around a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) continue, Stablecoins offer an existing, market-driven solution for digital dollar transactions. Here’s how Stablecoins can potentially strengthen the US Dollar ‘s global position: Increased Demand for Dollar-Denominated Assets: As mentioned, the reserve requirements of dollar-pegged Stablecoins create direct demand for dollar-denominated assets, including US Treasury securities. This reinforces the dollar’s status as a store of value. Enhanced Digital Accessibility: Stablecoins facilitate faster, cheaper, and more programmable transactions globally compared to traditional cross-border payment systems. This makes the digital dollar more attractive and easier to use for international commerce and remittances, potentially extending the dollar’s reach in new markets and digital economies. Alternative to Foreign Currencies in Digital Trade: In the absence of easy access to digital dollars via Stablecoins , users in digital ecosystems might opt for other currencies or assets. The availability of reliable dollar-pegged Stablecoins ensures the dollar remains the preferred medium of exchange in these growing digital spaces. Innovation Hub: The innovation spurred by the Stablecoin market within the U.S. regulatory framework (or proposed frameworks) can help maintain the U.S. as a leader in financial technology, further solidifying the dollar’s role. Secretary Bessent’s focus on US Treasury purchases highlights a tangible mechanism through which Stablecoins can provide direct economic benefit to the U.S. government by supporting its debt market. This is a different angle than just facilitating payments; it speaks to the underlying financial infrastructure that supports the dollar’s strength. Impact on the US Treasury and Financial Stability The sheer scale of the Stablecoin market means their reserve holdings are becoming increasingly significant. Major dollar-pegged Stablecoins represent tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization, and a substantial portion of this is held in assets like commercial paper, bank deposits, and critically, US Treasury bills and notes. Consider the implications for the US Treasury : New Source of Demand: As the Stablecoin market grows, it introduces a new, potentially large, and consistent buyer base for U.S. government debt. This diversification of buyers can be beneficial for market stability. Potential Impact on Borrowing Costs: Increased demand for Treasurys generally leads to higher prices for those securities, which translates to lower yields (interest rates) for the government when it borrows money. If Stablecoins become significant buyers, they could help keep U.S. borrowing costs lower than they otherwise might be. Reinforcing Market Depth and Liquidity: Large, active buyers contribute to the overall depth and liquidity of the US Treasury market, making it easier for the U.S. government to issue debt and for investors to trade it. This is crucial for maintaining Financial Stability . The idea that a technology born from the volatile world of Cryptocurrency could become a pillar of support for the highly traditional US Treasury market is a powerful testament to the potential for convergence between these two worlds. It underscores the need for policymakers to understand these new dynamics rather than simply viewing Cryptocurrency through a lens of risk. Stablecoins, Cryptocurrency, and the Path Forward Secretary Bessent’s comments signal a growing recognition within government that certain aspects of Cryptocurrency , specifically well-regulated and transparent Stablecoins , could be integrated into the existing financial system in beneficial ways. This perspective is vital for fostering a productive dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry. However, this potential doesn’t come without challenges. For Stablecoins to truly contribute to Financial Stability and strengthen the US Dollar and US Treasury , several key areas need attention: Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Clarity: A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for Stablecoins is essential. This includes rules around reserve requirements, auditing, redemption rights, and overall risk management to prevent failures that could harm users and potentially spill over into traditional markets. Reserve Management Risks: The quality and management of Stablecoin reserves are paramount. Lack of transparency or holding risky assets could undermine confidence and pose systemic risks if the market grows large enough. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that users understand the risks associated with Stablecoins and have adequate protections is crucial for building trust and encouraging adoption. Interoperability: Developing standards for how Stablecoins interact with traditional payment systems and other digital asset platforms will be key to their widespread utility. The conversation initiated by figures like Secretary Bessent moves beyond simply debating the merits of Bitcoin or the volatility of the broader Cryptocurrency market. It focuses on the specific utility and potential economic benefits that a particular class of digital asset – Stablecoins – can offer to the established financial order. This nuanced view is critical for developing regulation that fosters innovation while managing risk. Actionable Insights from the Treasury’s View What does this perspective from the U.S. Treasury mean for different stakeholders? For Policymakers: It reinforces the urgency of developing tailored, risk-based regulation for Stablecoins that acknowledges their potential benefits while mitigating risks. Collaboration with international bodies is also key to ensure global consistency. For the Cryptocurrency Industry: It highlights the importance of building transparent, well-managed Stablecoin projects that can demonstrate their safety and soundness to regulators and the public. Engaging constructively with policymakers is vital. For Investors and Users: It underscores the growing intersection between traditional finance and Cryptocurrency . Understanding how assets like Stablecoins fit into the broader financial ecosystem, including their role in reserve markets like US Treasury , is increasingly important. It also emphasizes the need to choose Stablecoins from reputable issuers with clear reserve policies. For Traditional Financial Institutions: It signals potential opportunities for collaboration and integration, particularly in areas like digital payments, asset tokenization, and participation in digital asset markets. The Secretary’s comments suggest a future where Stablecoins are not just tolerated but potentially embraced as tools that can enhance the existing financial infrastructure and reinforce the global standing of the US Dollar . This requires careful navigation of the regulatory landscape and continued innovation in building secure and reliable digital asset systems. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Stablecoins and the Dollar U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s view that Stablecoins can strengthen the US Dollar ’s global dominance by boosting demand for US Treasury assets marks a significant moment in the dialogue between government and the digital asset world. It shifts the focus from the speculative aspects of Cryptocurrency to the potential utility and economic benefits of Stablecoins as a digital form of the dollar and a new source of demand for U.S. government debt. While challenges related to regulation, risk management, and consumer protection remain, the recognition from a high-level official like Secretary Bessent highlights the potential for Stablecoins to become an integrated part of the global financial architecture, reinforcing the US Dollar ‘s position and contributing to overall Financial Stability . The path forward requires careful consideration, collaboration, and a commitment to building robust and transparent systems that can harness the power of digital innovation for the benefit of the traditional economy.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) cut its interest rate to zero on Thursday, to counter falling inflation, appreciating Swiss franc (CHF) and economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s trade war. The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China. The latest rate cut is bank’s sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024. The SNB’s return to zero may be a sign of things to come across Europe and other advanced nations.

At this point, there is one last stage left for GENIUS, which US President Donald Trump plans to approve by August. The GENIUS law must also receive approval from the House of Representatives before it can be signed by Trump. Now, as all eyes turn to the House of Representatives, a new statement came from Donald Trump. Accordingly, Trump, in his post on his Truth Social account, asked the House of Representatives to move quickly for the final signature of the GENIUS Act and urged it to pass as soon as possible. Trump stated that the Senate passed an incredible bill that would make the United States the undisputed leader in the field of digital assets. Describing the bill as pure genius, Trump said GENIIUS would bring major investments and major innovations to the United States. “….There will be no country that can do better than this. (This bill) is truly a genius idea. Get this to my desk now — NO DELAY, NO ADD-ON. With this I will show the world how to earn with digital assets like never before.” The GENIUS law imposes strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compulsory licensing, full reserve support, annual audits for issuers with a market value of over $50 billion, and regulatory oversight by foreign entities. The stablecoin bill GENIUS passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote and now awaits a vote in the House of Representatives. *This is not investment advice.
