2025-07-06T03:00:39,"Low Entry, High Stakes: 4 Top Crypto Presale Projects in 2025!","Presales give people a chance to grab coins early before they are listed publicly. As 2025 progresses, some projects are getting attention for their strong purpose, structured plans, and active communities. This article highlights four networks with different focuses, like mining systems, wallet utilities, Solana trading tools, and Bitcoin-based rewards. While each one has its unique approach, all share good upside potential during their current presale phases. Here are the top crypto presale projects in 2025 you should know about today, starting with BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG: GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Brings Special Pricing Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG’s presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11th. It has sold over 23.5 billion coins and raised $331.5 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The listing price is set at $0.05, opening the chance for over 3,000% returns when listed. There will be 45 batches or until it hits its $600 million funding target. This method builds strong infrastructure and market readiness before launch. BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG setup that supports fast processing with better energy efficiency. Its X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Hardware miners X30 and X100 will ship on July 7, and X10 on August 15. Security checks by CertiK and Halborn add to its credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing with real DeFi uses, an active system, and a six-week global plan, making it one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 with strong basics and early access advantages. BEST Wallet: A Multi-Use Wallet with Built-In Utility BEST Wallet offers a non-custodial wallet that works as a launchpad and staking platform. Its $BEST coin presale has raised over $13.5 million at a current price of $0.0252. From its 10 billion total coins, only 4.5% are in presale, spread across 100 small pricing stages. It offers swaps, bridges, staking, NFTs, and governance straight from its interface. Owning $BEST offers fee discounts, exclusive staking APYs above 105%, and access to future presales via the app. Security is boosted with Fireblocks MPC. Soon, NFT support and derivatives will launch. BEST Wallet is becoming a place for DeFi and presale activity, placing it among the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for those seeking wallet benefits and passive income options. Snorter: Telegram-Based Solana Trading Bot Snorter is built for Solana and gives fast, low-cost Telegram trading features. It combines sniping, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and copy-trading in one platform. Its standout feature is that it works directly within Telegram, letting users place trades quickly using simple chat commands. The presale is live, and pricing changes with demand via its portal. More than a bot, Snorter is building an entire system for the new Telegram trading era. As Solana bots grow, Snorter gives a timing and safety advantage. MEV protection and honeypot scanning help reduce risks often linked with fast sniping. This makes Snorter one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for users aiming to automate and improve their Solana trading strategies. BTC Bull: Coin Rewards Linked to Bitcoin Growth BTC Bull is a rewards coin that tracks Bitcoin’s market rise without needing to hold BTC itself. It uses custom smart contracts and DeFi staking layers to let users earn from BTC movements. The presale starts at around $0.001 with a burn system to keep the supply limited. Each presale stage has limited allocations to avoid sudden price drops. BTC Bull stands out for its rewards based on Bitcoin’s price. Users who stake early can earn higher APYs when BTC’s value goes up. Future plans include listings, BTC-pegged liquidity vaults, and rewards tied to Bitcoin dominance. With Bitcoin aiming beyond $60,000, BTC Bull gives a way to gain from this growth trend through structured incentives, making it a strong candidate in the top crypto presale projects in 2025 list. Final Remarks! BlockDAG offers an entry at just $0.0016 with early buyers seeing 2,660% gains so far, BEST Wallet combines wallet services with staking and launchpad utility, Snorter delivers Solana trading tools on Telegram, and BTC Bull lets users benefit from BTC price rises through its reward system. These top crypto presale projects in 2025 each bring their own features, from real usage to smart passive rewards. Picking the right one depends on your goals, but these projects are already building strong trust and practical use cases before their exchange listings.

2025-07-06T02:39:57,"Bitcoin Reserves Won’t Secure America’s Future, But Building a Financial Platform Will","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserves Won’t Secure America’s Future, But Building a Financial Platform Will When former President Donald Trump proposed creating a U.S. sovereign wealth fund with Bitcoin included as part of the country’s strategic reserves, the idea stirred up headlines and heated debate. At first glance, it might seem bold, even forward-thinking, for the United States to invest heavily in Bitcoin. But if we really care about long-term financial leadership, Americans should look beyond just buying digital assets. The smarter strategy lies in creating a national platform that integrates blockchain technology into our financial system. The U.S. holds a privileged place in the world economy. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, we benefit from widespread trust in our economy, our government, and our ability to maintain financial stability. That trust gives us enormous influence around the world. But maintaining that position requires forward-thinking action, not just investing in trendy assets. The Flaws in Relying on Bitcoin Reserves Many argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and resistance to manipulation make it a perfect candidate for national reserves. Since it is not controlled by any government, Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold, a supposedly safe and neutral asset in times of global uncertainty. But while that may sound good in theory, it doesn’t serve the practical needs of a national reserve. Strategic reserves are designed for emergencies, to settle international debts, support the economy in times of disruption, and ensure financial continuity. Bitcoin’s price volatility and limited real-world usage make it a poor fit for such purposes today. Worse yet, if the U.S. were to begin hoarding Bitcoin, the move might be interpreted as a lack of confidence in our own currency. That could undermine global trust in the dollar and open the door for geopolitical rivals, such as China or Russia, to challenge America’s financial credibility. Simply put, trying to “future-proof” the economy by holding Bitcoin could actually weaken our position in the short term. While it’s true that Bitcoin could evolve into a global settlement tool, that evolution is still underway. What’s needed now is not stockpiling crypto, but building the rails that allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to become functional parts of the financial system. Why Building a Platform Is a Better Strategy To really lead in the digital finance age, the U.S. must do more than own assets, we need to build the infrastructure others rely on. Think back to the early days of the internet. The winners weren’t those who simply bought up websites; it was the companies that built powerful platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, that shaped the digital economy. The same principle applies today. America should invest in becoming the premier hub for digital assets by creating trustworthy exchanges, safe custodial services, and streamlined on- and off-ramps for crypto. In doing so, we export American values like the rule of law, financial transparency, and technological innovation into the growing digital economy. Bitcoin might be the starting point, but it won’t be the end. As decentralized finance (DeFi) matures, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead in developing not just the tools, but the rules that define how digital assets operate globally. Real-World Applications Already Taking Root You don’t have to be an economist to see how digital finance is changing daily life. Currently, millions of Americans are utilizing cryptocurrency for more than just trading; they’re applying it to entertainment, investing, and even gaming. For example, the rise of online casinos in the U.S. highlights how fast digital transactions are being adopted. Many platforms now accept cryptocurrencies, allowing players to deposit and withdraw instantly with lower fees and more privacy. Still, while regulations vary by state, the demand for digital-first entertainment shows just how far the financial landscape has shifted. This isn’t a far-off future, it’s already happening, and it’s one more reason we need to lead with infrastructure, not speculation. The Power of Stablecoins Backed by the Dollar One of the biggest opportunities for strengthening America’s global financial role lies in the expansion of dollar-based stablecoins. These are digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering the stability of our national currency with the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology. Used wisely, stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more inclusive cross-border payments. They can provide people around the world with access to digital dollars without requiring a U.S. bank account. If properly regulated and with clear rules around reserves, consumer protection, and transparency, stablecoins could extend the reach of the dollar more effectively than traditional banks or foreign policy ever could. Of course, not all countries welcome dollarization, and in regions where local currencies are weak or politically sensitive, dollar-pegged stablecoins may face resistance. That’s where Bitcoin and other decentralized assets can act as neutral alternatives, bridging systems without being tied to any one nation. Sparking American Innovation Through Smart Policy The U.S. didn’t build the internet by micromanaging innovation. Instead, we laid the legal and technical groundwork for entrepreneurs to experiment and scale. That’s how Silicon Valley became the envy of the world. We can take a similar approach now by giving U.S. companies the space to build on top of open financial networks whether that’s blockchain, stablecoins, or other emerging tech. A balance between regulation and freedom is critical. With too much red tape, we risk losing talent and capital to friendlier markets. With too little oversight, we undermine trust. If we get the balance right, we can lead again, offering an open alternative to closed, authoritarian systems like central bank digital currencies being developed in places like China. Those systems may be efficient, but they don’t align with the open values America is known for.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside.

2025-07-06T01:00:13,"Analyst Who Predicted 600% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Says Next Leg Up Will Be ‘Parabolic’","A crypto analyst who previously forecasted a massive 600% XRP price surge in 2024 is once again drawing attention with a new technical analysis of the cryptocurrency. This time, the market expert says that XRP is getting ready for its next parabolic leg up. XRP Price Setup Signals Violent Upswing The latest XRP price analysis by market expert Crypto Michael indicates that the top altcoin has just concluded a significant period of consolidation and could be poised for an extremely explosive upward move. In his X post, the analyst shared a supporting chart, capturing XRP’s price action from 2017 to 2026, based on a long-term quarterly candlestick view. Over these years, XRP formed a large symmetrical triangle through a convergence of trendlines, illustrating a prolonged phase of price compression and market indecision. This chart pattern, extending from a peak in 2018 through to mid-2024, culminated in a decisive breakout in 2025. With Crypto Michael now considering XRP’s prolonged consolidation complete , technical indicators show a shift into a buildup phase ahead of the next major leg up . The analysis also highlights that this consolidation was necessary to accumulate buying pressure and position XRP for a shift out of its downtrend. Moving forward, the XRP price chart shows that the analyst expects a breakout from the symmetrical triangle soon. Once the cryptocurrency crosses the upper boundary of the triangle, a sustained move above key resistance levels could serve as a strong bullish signal. While the analyst has not explicitly outlined the exact target for his optimistic projection, the trajectory of his chart highlights that the XRP price, currently sitting at $2.22, is set to move upward. Analyst Sets Next XRP ATH Target Above $80 In other news, crypto analyst CW has dropped another incredibly bold forecast for the XRP price. The market expert presented a compelling multi-cycle chart, suggesting that XRP is in the final stages of a long-term consolidation and is now gathering momentum for a massive breakout . According to CW’s chart analysis, XRP has been in a six-month accumulation period, similar to patterns seen in previous markets. This steady accumulation phase appears to be forming a converging triangle, which historically is a precursor to major upward moves. Now at the cusp of a breakout, especially after testing the previous ATH region, the analyst suggests that XRP is finally stabilizing, interpreting this calm as a steady energy build-up for the next surge. If historical patterns hold, a surge beyond ATH prices could ignite a vertical rally. The chart identifies the first target at the previous ATH level above $3.8, followed by a second target around $21.5. The final target, representing phase 5 of the analysis, points to a parabolic surge beyond $80.

2025-07-06T00:30:52,"US Secret Service unmasks $400M crypto scam network","Over the past decade, the US Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has quietly recovered nearly $400 million in digital assets from cybercriminals, emerging as a formidable force in global crypto enforcement. What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

2025-07-05T23:30:39,"Here’s How High XRP Could Rise If Bitcoin Hits $1M","The possibility of Bitcoin reaching a $1 million valuation has gained considerable attention from industry leaders and financial analysts. As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Surpass This Estimate Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million? While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.

2025-07-05T23:00:14,"Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins","Bitcoin has held steady around the $108,000 price level in recent days. After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet” that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.” This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin’s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn’s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin’s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin’s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet’s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

Concurrently, the XYZVerse presale has surpassed the $14 million milestone, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. These developments may be early indicators of a broader surge in alternative cryptocurrencies. The market is abuzz, and the coming days could reveal impactful shifts. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth.

Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.

2025-07-05T22:00:13,"Analyst Reveals What Will Cause XRP Price Explosion","In a recent video shared on his X handle, prominent crypto analyst CryptoSensei outlined what he believes could trigger a massive price surge for XRP: the growing momentum behind XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As institutional interest in XRP gains traction across North America, the groundwork is being laid for what many believe could be the next big wave in crypto adoption, pending one breakthrough. XRP ETFs Gaining Ground in North America CryptoSensei highlighted that three major investment firms, Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, and 3iQ, have already secured regulatory approval for XRP ETFs in North America. Collectively, these firms manage over $32 billion in assets. Purpose Investments leads with $23 billion under management, followed by Evolve ETFs with $7 billion and 3iQ with $2 billion. While these approvals have primarily come from Canada, a jurisdiction known for its progressive stance on digital assets, they signal growing institutional confidence in XRP as a legitimate financial instrument. Canada has historically led the charge in crypto ETF approvals, having greenlit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs long before the U.S. followed suit. The approval of XRP ETFs there could be the first domino in a broader shift toward mainstream adoption. This will make #XRP explode… #Crypto pic.twitter.com/aO2v2DBAg4 — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) July 5, 2025 Institutional Demand Waiting on U.S. Clarity According to CryptoSensei, between 11 and 12 major U.S. institutions have filed for XRP ETFs . However, none have been approved, largely due to the ongoing legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple and its native token. The crux of the delay remains the SEC’s long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which alleges the company engaged in unregistered securities offerings through its XRP sales. Although Ripple scored a partial victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in itself, the case remains unresolved. Most recently, on June 26, 2025, Judge Torres rejected a proposed settlement agreement, leaving the legal status of XRP in limbo. Days later, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company would no longer pursue a counter-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop its appeal as well, effectively allowing the case to close. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 August Could Be the Turning Point CryptoSensei believes August could mark a decisive moment. “We will get an update on that in August. Please God, let this be finished and done in time,” he said, expressing the hope shared by many in the XRP community. A favorable conclusion to the case would remove the biggest barrier holding back U.S.-based XRP ETFs. With institutional demand already building and precedents set in neighboring markets, a final resolution in the Ripple case could ignite the long-anticipated XRP rally. If the SEC steps out of the way, ETF approvals could follow swiftly , positioning XRP for a significant price explosion fueled by mainstream investment flows. For now, all eyes are on August, as the crypto world waits to see whether XRP will finally be cleared for liftoff.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Bitcoin’s Consolidation: A Preparation For Final Bull Leg In an X post on July 4, Ted Pillows shares a bullish market insight following another Bitcoin price dip. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency seemed on course to resume its market uptrend after a significant price rebound from $99,000 in late June following weeks of downward consolidatory movement. However, another decisive rejection in the $110,000 indicates Bitcoin’s prices remain range-bound thereby worsening investors’ concern across the market. In interpreting this situation, Pillows has called for calm stating the recent price dip is merely a “leverage flush” that requires no panic. Using a visual study on the BTC weekly chart, the renowned analyst shows that the current and previous price pullbacks are part of a predictable pattern that has played out across previous Bitcoin cycles. The chart shows that after each halving event, Bitcoin tends to peak approximately 18 months (518 days) later. With the most recent halving occurring in mid April 2024, the expected peak for this cycle would fall somewhere around Q4 2025, specifically on October 13, 2025, consistent with historical performance. Furthermore, a recurring 140-day rally window is also depicted in the chart, usually forming the final leg of the bull run. In each previous cycle, this 10-bar stretch delivered parabolic price movements. If history is rhyming once again, Bitcoin is now within range of initiating this 10-week bull run, suggesting the equivalent rally seen in previous could soon kick in.

Based on Pillows’ recent analysis, Bitcoin may be gathering momentum for its final rally of the present market cycle. The extent of this anticipated uptrend remains unknown; however, the presence of bullish factors most notably the high influx of institutional investment and the US pro-crypto policies supports a range of sky scraping targets. For example, Pillows has previously shared that the popular stock-to-flow model which uses Bitcoin’s scarcity to project long-term price trajectory has predicted a potential price target of $368,925 by 2025 end. If this prediction holds true, Bitcoin investors are eyeing an estimated 242% from current market prices. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $108,299 reflecting a 0.83% gain in the past week.

2025-07-05T21:00:17,"Rumors: Bitcoin Early Adopters Are Selling Out to Buy XRP","A fresh wave of speculation is rippling through the crypto market following a viral X post by Edo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a long-time XRP advocate. According to Farina, some early Bitcoin adopters may be cashing out of their BTC holdings to accumulate XRP, marking what could be a major shift in sentiment among crypto’s earliest investors. A Strategic Rotation? Farina’s remarks draw attention to a potential change in the behavior of early BTC holders. He likened the current opportunity to buy XRP near the $2 mark to buying Bitcoin when it traded under $100, a historic moment that minted many of today’s crypto millionaires. The recent dip in XRP’s price below $2 and its quick correction may be a calculated trap to shake out weak hands, allowing savvy investors to accumulate. He went further, claiming that some veteran Bitcoin holders used this opportunity to exit BTC and rotate into XRP, betting on its long-term breakout potential. While this claim lacks concrete on-chain evidence, it has captured the attention of traders looking for signs of a broader market realignment. RUMORS: BTC EARLY ADOPTERS ARE SELLING OUT TO BUY $XRP . — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 The XRP Adoption Narrative Farina has long promoted XRP as a sleeping giant poised for mass adoption. In previous posts, he introduced the concept of the “XRP Adoption Candle,” suggesting a coming wave of institutional use, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF listings. In his view, XRP’s fundamentals, especially its use in real-world cross-border transactions, are becoming too compelling to ignore. He’s warned followers not to make the same mistake early Bitcoin holders did when they sold at $500, only to see BTC surge past $100,000. According to Farina, selling XRP at $10 or even $20 could one day look just as short-sighted . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism and Reality Check Despite Farina’s assertions, no verifiable on-chain data confirms a mass migration from BTC to XRP. While XRP wallet activity has surged up nearly 500% since 2022, analysts note that most of this growth has been retail-driven. Bitcoin, by contrast, remains the institutional heavyweight, still dominating capital inflows and long-term holding behavior. Farina’s claim that Bitcoin early adopters are reallocating into XRP may be more speculative than factual, for now. But it taps into a growing belief that XRP’s moment is near and that its current price level represents a historic buying opportunity. Whether the rumor proves true or not, it reflects a palpable shift in sentiment, one that could redefine the next phase of crypto market leadership.

2025-07-05T21:00:00,"Bitcoin exposure or fiat disguise? Treasury firms divide the crypto community","Bitcoin treasury companies — entities that accumulate the digital asset (usually through borrowed assets) — offer clients indirect exposure through their stock. Some believe that these companies bring Bitcoin to Wall Street. Others think that these treasury companies are doing the opposite: turning bitcoiners into so-called “fiat bros.” From self-custody of private keys to indirect Bitcoin ‘exposure’ In 2021, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk famously replied “Your app sucks” to a crypto wallet that didn’t support user access to their private keys. Now, when Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies get so much attention, it may seem that self-custody has silently left the scene. Although the big narrative is occupied with the news about treasury companies spending millions of dollars (of borrowed money) to buy as many bitcoins as possible, bitcoiners who (at best) don’t care about “indirect exposure to Bitcoin” didn’t go anywhere. They are just not as visible on social and mass media. Indirect Bitcoin exposure, or owning paper Bitcoin, is owning certain assets issued by the company that strategically accumulate Bitcoin on its balance sheets. Stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies (for instance, MSTR by Strategy) or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of asset management companies holding Bitcoin (for example, IBIT by BlackRock) are two of the most popular types of assets that expose users to Bitcoin. It is assumed that owning these assets allows holders to benefit from the price movements of Bitcoin as they are reflected in the value of these assets. That’s why Bitcoin ETFs, stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies, Bitcoin derivatives, and similar assets are considered to be holding Bitcoin, although it’s essentially paper Bitcoin. Read more: How we went from Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin Are treasury companies Trojan-horsing Wall Street? Some view treasury companies as a straightforward means for institutional and corporate investors to enter the crypto market. Indeed, for companies, buying stocks of Strategy is easier than buying Bitcoin in terms of the law. Strategy is holding nearly 600,000 bitcoins, and engaging in such a regular activity as buying MSTR stocks exposes corporate buyers to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. As treasury companies continue to accumulate bitcoins relentlessly, they increase buying pressure, which prevents the BTC price from experiencing significant drops. Corporations buying stocks of treasury companies indirectly invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury companies short fiat money and buy bitcoin. Greatest business model in human history. — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) July 1, 2025 Michael Saylor, the Chairman of Strategy, said he wants to bridge the cryptocurrency economy and traditional capital markets. Some view him and other treasury companies as a Trojan horse that takes Bitcoin to Wall Street. However, some see the opposite happening – treasury companies are turning bitcoiners into traditional finance investors. Treasury companies’ critics stress that, despite much talk about Bitcoin, these companies are operating in the conventional finance sector and promoting their stocks to both TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto investors. Who’s Trojan Horsing Who? @americanhodl8 deserves an Oscar for this Bitcoin masterpiece 🔥 pic.twitter.com/mek5h12RMo — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) June 30, 2025 Notably, these companies don’t pay their employees in crypto, nor do they accept Bitcoin as a payment method for their stocks, among other things. Literally, these companies don’t offer any kind of Bitcoin experience to their clients and employees. For the TradFi sector, treasury companies serve as a way to profit from Bitcoin’s value growth. However, for Bitcoin investors, these companies may appear to be a TradFi agent’s invasion that seduces people to stop buying and holding bitcoins and switch to a traditional instrument like stocks. The Bitcoin standard narrative allegedly only serves as a promotion tool for the audience of Bitcoin enthusiasts. https://t.co/RASOc9PsWg — Satoshi’s Journal (@SatoshisJournal) November 10, 2024 While there is nothing wrong with competing for investors, it seems that bitcoiners are angered by the fact that treasury companies have infected most of the Bitcoin-related media with promotional posts about them. Self-custody advocates argue that Bitcoin podcasters, Crypto X, crypto conferences–all these platforms are “shilling” Strategy and Nakamoto stocks. As a result, it leaves too little space for conversation with those who share similar values, such as independence and a self-custody philosophy. ""Every podcaster who is not a treasury company executive is a policy failure. We must seize the means of paper bitcoin production"" Wow! (pic unrelated) pic.twitter.com/6142sYrBFy — Andrew M. Bailey (@resistancemoney) July 3, 2025 Another concern associated with treasury companies is that their strategies may not be so safe, and at some point, they will have to sell the bitcoins they buy. It may trigger a domino effect that could bury even giants like Strategy. According to a recent report from venture capital company Breed, most Bitcoin treasury companies are unlikely to survive a “death spiral” that may be triggered by a sudden drop in the BTC price. The chances of the companies resurrecting after the crash are thinner, especially given their centralized nature.

This comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $110,000 level, which has acted as a major resistance point in recent sessions. As of press time, BTC was trading at $108,118, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The cryptocurrency is now holding above its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ), a key support level that, if maintained, could fuel a sharp rally. According to TradingShot, the current setup mirrors Bitcoin’s April–May rally, when a similar channel up pattern peaked near the 2.618 Fibonacci extension . The fractal shows the same series of lower highs, eventually broken by a strong upward move. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

If the pattern holds, TradingShot projects BTC could reach $130,000 by early August, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch On the other hand, analysis by Ali Martinez in an X post on July 5 identified key price levels to watch.

Below that, another cluster of 1.71 million addresses is positioned near $98,566, providing additional support. On-chain data shows 89.36% of BTC holders are still “in the money,” highlighting resilience despite volatility, while just 10.36% are underwater.

2025-07-05T20:00:51,"Three Strong Reasons to Buy XRP Before End of Summer","XRP has seen modest performance so far in 2025, with only a 5% gain in the first six months of the year. However, there are clear signs that the remainder of the year could present much stronger momentum for the cryptocurrency. Several key developments are on the horizon, which may justify taking a position in XRP before the end of summer. This article examines three major factors that could drive demand: regulatory clarity, the emergence of XRP-focused treasury strategies, and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Regulatory clarity approaching The long-standing legal uncertainty surrounding XRP is close to resolution. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, has indicated since March that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was preparing to drop its case against it. In June, Ripple further stated it planned to withdraw any future appeals, while the SEC similarly suggested it would cease pursuing additional appeals. Although final paperwork remains outstanding, the case is expected to conclude by the end of July. Beyond the lawsuit, significant legislative efforts are progressing in Congress to create a more structured regulatory environment for digital assets. Two proposed laws — the Genius Act and the Clarity Act — are considered particularly relevant to XRP. The Genius Act sets out rules for stablecoins, a segment where the XRP blockchain could see new growth. Meanwhile, the Clarity Act would establish a regulatory framework for all digital assets. It could remove barriers for institutional investors wary of compliance risks. Both bills are projected to reach President Donald Trump’s desk for signature before Congress recesses in August, creating an environment of regulatory certainty that could benefit XRP’s adoption and value . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Treasury Companies Gaining Traction Another trend worth noting is the rise of companies adding XRP to their corporate treasuries. In June, VivoPower International announced plans to acquire $120 million worth of XRP for its balance sheet, marking the first such move of its kind. Soon after, Trident Digital Tech Holdings revealed it would allocate $500 million in XRP. These decisions echo the approach taken by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which amassed a significant Bitcoin position over the past five years, now valued at $65 billion. Although current XRP treasury initiatives are limited to smaller companies, there is growing anticipation that a larger firm may follow suit in the coming months. Analysts have suggested the possibility of a “MicroStrategy of XRP” emerging before the end of summer, which could further validate and elevate the asset in corporate finance circles. Spot XRP ETFs under review Perhaps the most anticipated development is the SEC’s pending decision on spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg estimates a 95% likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF this year. The deadline for a final decision is mid-October. However, approval could come earlier. The recent SEC approval of a Grayscale fund holding XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggests momentum is building toward acceptance of dedicated spot XRP ETFs. If approved, spot ETFs would allow institutional capital to flow into XRP more easily, particularly once regulatory legislation is finalized. Industry observers have noted that such developments would signal that “it’s OK to invest in XRP,” removing legal and compliance concerns that previously restrained investment from larger entities. Looking Beyond Summer Investors should remain mindful of potential risks despite these positive catalysts. XRP has fallen short of expectations before, and if any of these developments fail to materialize, its price may stagnate or grow only modestly. However, if the three catalysts align as anticipated, there is optimism that XRP could retest its historical highs and strengthen its position in the market before year-end. Given the current trajectory and the convergence of these factors, summer 2025 appears to offer a unique opportunity for those considering entering or expanding their positions in XRP.

2025-07-05T20:00:23,"Scammers Drain $70,000 From Bank Accounts in Scheme Targeting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Capital One Customers: Report","An ATM scheme has reportedly drained tens of thousands of dollars from elderly customers of the biggest banks in the United States. New York City police are warning senior citizens to be on the lookout for a trio of scammers at ATMs after a crime spree that occurred between May and June, reports The New York Post. Authorities warn that the group – made up of two men and a woman – act as good Samaritans by offering to help the elderly use the ATM or strike up a conversation with them as a distraction to try and steal their bank cards. Police say that on May 14th, the trio stole $20,000 from the bank account of a 90-year-old woman and drained $3,000 from the account of an 83-year-old woman in two separate incidents that occurred just one hour apart. On June 2nd, one of the thieves started up a conversation with a 71-year-old man while withdrawing cash at a Chase Bank ATM. While the victim was distracted, the scammer stole the man’s bank card and linked up with another man at a different Chase Bank ATM location, where they tried to take out $5,500. The 71-year-old says the scammers charged $6,000 to his account in just one hour. The thieves struck again on June 19th when they targeted an 86-year-old woman and stole about $24,000 from her account. According to the police, the trio is responsible for stealing at least $70,000 from elderly victims. Authorities say that a total of nine incidents of thieves using the same scheme against seniors at Chase Bank, Bank of America, Capital One and Citibank locations in New York were reported between May 8th and June 26th.

2025-07-05T20:00:14,"Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack?","In a recent X post, CryptoWzrd highlighted that Litecoin (LTC) closed the day on a slightly bearish note. He explained that LTC’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin’s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC’s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today’s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be ‘Just Weeks Away’ From Third-Ever Golden Cross — Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action.
