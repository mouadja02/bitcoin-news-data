2025-07-06T15:30:09,"Why Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Are Relevant To Market Dynamics — Analyst Explains","The crypto market was shaken by a rare occurrence on Friday, July 4, when a dormant whale—holding Bitcoin mined as far back as 2011— became active again . The Satoshi-era entity ended up moving around 81,000 BTC (worth around $8.8 billion) that had been held for 14 years. These significant movements, the largest single-day transfer volume of 10+ year-old coins, sparked interesting conversations in the crypto community. A popular on-chain analyst has come forward with their interpretation of this phenomenon, saying that “old Bitcoin still matters”. Why Does Old Bitcoin Matter? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost provided on-chain context on the significance of dormant BTC addresses waking up and shaking the market. This on-chain analysis is based on UTXO Age Bands %, which segments the total BTC supply based on the last time they were transacted. To begin their analysis, Darkfost acknowledged that the coins moved on Friday were reportedly mined in 2011 when Bitcoin was valued at below $1. According to the crypto analyst, these movements are a reminder of the market influence of miners due to extremely large BTC reserves. In their Quicktake post, Darkfost used the UTXO Age Bands % metric to visualize how significant the holdings of these Satoshi-era miners are. According to data from CryptoQuant, the 10+ year age band holds a substantial 17%, the largest percentage of the total BTC supply. The cohort of Bitcoin holders with the second largest portion (15.8%) of the total supply lies within the 6 – 12 month age band. This investor group is followed closely by the 3-5 year age band, with 14.3% of the total BTC supply. “This shift represents the transition from STH to Long LTH and suggests that recent buyers are still holding despite market conditions,” Darkfost explained. Furthermore, investors in the 7 – 10 year age band also hold a significant portion of the total supply, reflecting the control that long-term holders wield over the largest cryptocurrency market. Ultimately, Darkfost concluded that the movement of old BTC is critical to market dynamics as it can carry macro-level implications. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The price of Bitcoin has been relatively steady since the occurrence of these large-scale coin movements, while there has been no indication of selling by the Satoshi-era miner. As of this writing, BTC is valued at $108,135, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/satoshi-era-bitcoin-are-relevant-to-market-dynamics/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Realized Cap UTXO Age Bands (%)|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

According to reports, he raps, “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ That line isn’t just catchy—it’s another sign of how Bitcoin references are moving past finance blogs into hit songs. Adoption Numbers And Hype Based on reports from River, nearly 5% of the world’s population has used or owns Bitcoin so far. That’s a long way from Blockware’s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state’s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can’t be raided for other expenses. A follow‑up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3. Bitcoin Lyrics Hit Home Drake’s new verse isn’t his first high‑stakes play with crypto. Back in 2022, he put $1 million worth of Bitcoin bet on the Super Bowl. That bold wager grabbed headlines and showed he takes crypto chances seriously. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Now, by weaving Bitcoin into his music, he’s giving millions of listeners a taste of what traders already know: prices can swing hard, fast, and without warning. Looking ahead, Drake’s new song and Texas’s reserve show two sides of crypto’s rise. The pop‑culture nods pull attention, while real‑world policies test whether Bitcoin can move from hype into everyday use. If both trends keep climbing, Bitcoin could win more hearts—and wallets—in the years to come.

2025-07-06T14:55:27,"Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Warns of ‘Unprecendented Social Upheaval,’ Stock and Bond Market Crash Amid Rise of AI","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones says the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may cause more collateral damage than anyone is expecting. In a new op-ed for Time , Jones says that while we can celebrate technological progress, there should also be consideration, or even “vigorous debate,” of the societal cost of game-changing technologies like AI. The Tudor Investment Corporation founder references a recent warning from Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who said AI could eliminate about half of all entry level white collar jobs in the next one to five years. Even if Amodei is only half correct, Jones says such a transformation would create “unprecedented social upheaval.” “If we follow the playbook of the last 45 years where over 92% of productivity gains went to shareholders over workers, and if Amodei is even half right on his unemployment prediction, you can bet we will face unprecedented social upheaval. In the worst-case scenario, the safety-net strains that high unemployment will place on states and municipalities will force many into bankruptcy. The federal government won’t be a good backstop because with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120% it won’t have the borrowing power it once did. Bond markets will tank and take stocks with them.” The investor calls for several responses to AI, including a federal law requiring AI content to be watermarked so it’s clear it’s AI-generated. Otherwise, Jones says “humans will become irrelevant in the world we are headed for if we don’t demand human authenticity.” Jones also calls for a bipartisan commission that addresses issues of productivity sharing, as well as bilateral talks with China to “start establishing shared AI safety protocols to protect the entire world from mistakes and bad actors.” “None of this is radical. It’s rational. The unemployment data on entry-level jobs is a call to action. The first signs of the societal disruptions of AI are already here.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%.

The outlook is based on Ethereum’s long-term weekly charts, which show the asset has been consolidating in a descending triangle pattern since peaking in November 2021. Despite multiple failed attempts to break out of this structure, most recently in December 2024, the pattern of rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025 suggests mounting upward pressure, according to a TradingView analysis by Master Ananda on July 5. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The expert noted that April 2025 marked a lower low, forming a rounded bottom structure at the $2,425 support level. While ETH briefly dipped below that level, it quickly reclaimed it, signaling strong buying pressure. This move is seen as marking the end of a long bearish phase that began in March 2024. The key resistance level to watch is around $3,068, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement , followed by the $3,800 to $4,000 range, where price could revisit previous highs. However, the real target lies at $5,791, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, expected to be reached before the end of 2025. Ananda noted that momentum could potentially carry ETH as high as $8,500. “Now, if we really want to talk about minimum because we really don’t care about worst case scenario, the fundamentals are improving and everything is getting better, consider $5,791. This would be the minimum. With the Ethereum ETFs and the 2025 bull market, we then open up $8,500 and so on,” he said. Ethereum’s key support level Meanwhile, analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on July 6 highlighted the importance of Ethereum maintaining the $2,500 support zone. He observed that the second-ranked cryptocurrency continues to show resilience, holding firmly above this level, now viewed as a key pivot for potential upside momentum. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In his outlook, the analyst noted that the digital currency is finding consistent buy-side interest between the $2,500 and $2,600 range. This period of consolidation follows a volatile June, during which the price briefly dipped below $2,400 before quickly recovering. Currently, the next major resistance lies near the $2,800 and $2,900 range, a supply zone ETH has struggled to break above since May. A successful retest and bounce from $2,500 could pave the way for a breakout toward those levels.

2025-07-06T14:00:03,"Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So","Bitcoin started the month of July with a convincing rally to the upside, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment amongst investors from its performance by the end of June. The upward rally, however, cooled off following the release of positive employment data by the United States. Traders might have expected this data to be typically bullish, but that has hardly been the reality for the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, a certain investor cohort, as shown by on-chain revelation, has decided to return to the market and bet on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Retail Investors In, Long-Term Holders Out? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha highlighted the increasing divergence between retail and institutional behavior in the BTC market. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Taha started by pointing out that Binance Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has remained below $11.5 billion. The crypto pundit explained that this price level has been acting as strong resistance, as Bitcoin traders have repeatedly closed positions near this price threshold. Interestingly, these levels are very close to the same price region around which resistance was observed on June 10th. Taha stated that this could mean the bullish momentum is beginning to wane for the flagship cryptocurrency. On another hand, short-term holders (STH), who are typically the retail traders, have increased their exposure to the market by about 382,000 BTC. This can only mean that there has been renewed retail interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. Contrary to the short-term holders’ actions, the long-term holders (LTH) reduced their holdings by an amount similar to the STH exposure. Taha explained that this could be a result of profit taking or risk management within this investor class. In essence, the retail investors are “buying the dip,” while the more experienced are seemingly reducing their risks. Bitcoin Whales Enter Distribution Phase Also supporting the conceived idea of caution in institutions and whales, Taha reported that large holders (holders with over 10,000 BTC) offloaded about 12,000 BTC on the 3rd of July. This kind of move, according to the analyst, signals potential profit taking or perhaps strategic reallocation. Besides what they might signify, large transactions tend to have a substantial impact on market dynamics, as significant amounts of BTC are involved in each trade. However, the large holders were not the only profit takers. According to Taha, mid-sized whales (those holding 1,000-10,000 BTC) also shed some of their holdings. From June 30th, approximately 14,000 BTC were sold by this class. Deducible from these transactions is the idea that the whales seem to be in their distribution phase, either because they anticipate further bearish momentum or await better positioning opportunities. If macro conditions remain favorable, the Bitcoin market could resume its bullish rally, but this ultimately falls on the renewal of larger players’ confidence. For now, the road ahead remains uncertain. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $108,152, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Since March this year, the tally has oscillated between $3,000 and $30,000, indicating anaemic demand for the network despite BTC establishing a foothold above $100,000.

In a new press release , the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says that 41-year-old Ehis Lawrence Akhimie has pleaded guilty to operating a transnational inheritance fraud scheme that defrauded over $6 million from more than 400 victims over the course of several years. Authorities say that Akhimie and his co-conspirators sent letters to their victims in the US falsely claiming they were representatives of a bank in Spain. The scammers told the recipients that their relative had died in another country and left them with a multi-million-dollar inheritance. The bad actors also told their victims that if they wanted to receive the inheritance, they would need to pay delivery fees, taxes and other bills to avoid any friction with the government. The scammers then raked in the money and never followed through on any promise. Akhimie faces 20 years behind bars after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. As stated by Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, “The Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch will continue to pursue, prosecute and bring to justice transnational criminals responsible for defrauding US consumers, wherever they are located. This case is a testament to the critical role of international collaboration in tackling transnational crime.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-06T13:24:32,"Bitcoin whale moves $8.6 billion in BTC, likely for address upgrade, not selling","According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the Bitcoin whale who recently moved $8.6 billion in BTC for the first time in over 14 years likely has no intention to sell. The firm believes the whale transferred their assets for an address upgrade. In an X post , the firm said , “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses. There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin.” Whale transferred assets due to transition to a Native SegWit address Arkham had earlier revealed that a BTC whale executed eight transfers to relocate roughly 80,000 BTC purchased years ago for just $0.78 to $3.37 per coin. However, within the first few hours of the transfer, speculation swirled about potential sell-offs and a looming crypto market crash. Crypto community members questioned the trader’s intentions, leading to a brief period of Bitcoin price consolidation. While some interpreted the transfer as a calculated effort to take advantage of Bitcoin nearing its all-time high, others viewed it as a potential ploy to sow FUD in the market before pumping their prices for greater returns. Some also believed that the trader needed to update their cold storage solution, and others went as far as to associate the move with the government. Arkham, however, suggests the eight transfers were made as a technical move to transition from a legacy wallet to a more secure and fee-efficient Native SegWit address. The firm claimed there were no signs that the whale intends to sell the assets. Nevertheless, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that although there’s no indication that the tokens are being readied for sale, the past few months have shown early holders slowly selling into ETF and corporate treasury demand. For instance, in February, Bitcoiner PlanB disclosed that he had converted all of his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs. He argued that not dealing with keys anymore is much easier, adding, “I guess I am not a maxi anymore.” Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggests wallet compromise The Bitcoin transfer also drew the attention of major crypto players, some weighing in on the possible cause or just giving their general opinion on the matter. For starters, Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, suggested that the $8.6 billion transfer might result from a hack, warning that if confirmed, it could represent the largest theft in crypto history. He further argued that before the assets were moved, a single BCH test transaction was done, possibly indicating that the actor was testing the private key discreetly, as BCH tends to attract less attention from whale-tracking services. On the other hand, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stated that he “got into crypto too late,” citing how 14 years ago most whales bought their BTC for roughly $0.1. Some analysts hinted that Roger Ver could be the whale responsible for the transfer. They believe he made similar Bitcoin purchases in 2011 and recently bailed out of a Spanish prison on June 5. However, nothing about the whale’s identity has been confirmed.

2025-07-06T13:15:00,"Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200M in RWAs on XRP Ledger, Ripple Reveals","Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest crypto exchanges, announced plans to tokenize $200 million worth of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger. Key Takeaways: Mercado Bitcoin will tokenize $200M in fixed-income and equity assets on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s move comes amid forecasts of a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033. Calls for clear U.S. tokenization rules are growing as major players push into RWAs. The move will bring tokenized fixed-income and equity instruments onto XRPL, as the exchange looks to tap into the growing market for digital versions of traditional assets, according to a statement released by Ripple on Friday . “Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” said Silvio Pegado, Managing Director, LATAM at Ripple. Push for Tokenization Rules Gains Steam in US Market Ripple’s announcement follows a Boston Consulting Group report forecasting the tokenized RWA sector to reach a market capitalization of $19 trillion by 2033, underscoring surging interest from both crypto-native and traditional financial players. The deal highlights momentum across the industry as asset managers and blockchain firms ramp up efforts to secure regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets, especially in the United States. Earlier this week, Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance protocol, acquired Oasis Pro , a regulated trading platform specializing in digital securities settlements, to deepen its footprint in the RWA market. Meanwhile, Centrifuge, another blockchain firm focused on real-world assets, unveiled plans to tokenize the S&P 500 index, offering decentralized access to a basket of America’s top publicly listed companies. WOW! THIS IS BULLISH FOR $XRP Mercado Bitcoin is unlocking $200M+ of real-world assets on XRP Ledger No hype, just regulated yield on-chain This is LATAM’s biggest tokenization wave, and it won’t stop there When $19T goes digital, will you still be on the sidelines? pic.twitter.com/QwGoRtTBeK — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 5, 2025 The rush into tokenized RWAs has also attracted attention from the biggest names in finance. In January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink publicly called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds , arguing it could improve market efficiency. Last week, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins told CNBC that the “rules have not been clear” when it comes to regulating digital assets in the United States and hinted at the “imminent” boom in tokenization as a whole. Atkins claimed that tokenization is “the next step” in order to have “much more efficiency” across markets. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against SEC to Resolve Case Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company will withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal. The announcement followed a U.S. district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. In her ruling, Judge Analisa Torres noted Ripple’s readiness to “push the boundaries” of the earlier summary judgment, suggesting a risk of future violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the firm faced a choice between dropping the appeal or continuing to contest the finding. He emphasized that regardless of the decision, “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” and assured that Ripple’s business operations would continue as usual.

2025-07-06T13:00:00,"Chart of the Week: Wall Street Has Claimed Bitcoin—Now What?","""Wall Street is coming for bitcoin."" That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general)—an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. A major example in BTC’s history that’s not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis. The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe’s debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut. In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin’s response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold. After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox , the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity. That changed everything. The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility . But let’s face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset. ""Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,"" said NYDIC Research in a report. In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. ""Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range."" Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is), bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold. Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. NYDIG notes that bitcoin’s correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now. Risk asset So why the shift? The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with ""safe haven."" Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included. ""This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,"" said NYDIG. And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities. ""The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,"" NYDIG's report said. For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker.

While asset management companies’ increasing optimism about US stocks is drawing attention, there are warnings that this excitement could lead to overly concentrated positions and cause sharp fluctuations, especially in the event of a negative development.

In an X post on Friday, Arkham stated , “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” providing reassurance to market participants closely watching the transaction. The transfer involved 10,000 Bitcoin at a time from eight wallets that had remained untouched since 2011, sparking curiosity across the crypto community. Arkham noted that the activity may have been driven by a technical reason, suggesting the Bitcoin owner could be upgrading from legacy wallets to Native SegWit addresses for enhanced security and lower transaction fees. Wallet Upgrade May Explain Whale Activity: Arkham “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham explained. The firm detailed that the Bitcoin was originally deposited into these wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and remained dormant for over 14 years before being moved to eight new wallets, where the funds have since stayed. While there is no evidence suggesting an imminent market impact, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that its analysis has long indicated early Bitcoin holders may gradually offload their holdings to meet the demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries. However, it remains unclear if the current transfers are part of such activity. The event also drew commentary from prominent industry figures. PlanB, a well-known Bitcoiner, recently revealed in February that he converted all his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing convenience and peace of mind. Speculation and Reactions from Industry Leaders While most interpretations of the whale transfer remain technical, Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, floated a cautious note, stating there is a slim possibility the massive movement could have resulted from a hack . “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan commented. The unusual transfer caught the attention of former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who took a lighthearted approach, stating, “I got into crypto too late,” after observing the 2011 Bitcoin whales moving coins they obtained for around $0.10 each. Despite the intrigue, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable , reflecting market confidence that the movement of these dormant funds is not an immediate threat to the current trading environment.

2025-07-06T12:30:12,"Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown","Bitcoin is currently holding just above the $108,000 level and bulls are maintaining momentum after a volatile start to July. However, a closer look at on-chain data shows how fragile that position might be. Interestingly, two support levels, $106,738 and $98,566, are now the most important zones for bulls to defend. These levels represent clusters of addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin, and losing them could trigger a deeper correction. Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ Bitcoin’s Support Clusters Around $106,000 And $98,000 Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to two major support levels based on data showing Bitcoin’s purchase clusters. This data is based on Sentora’s (previously IntoTheBlock) In/Out of the Money Around Price metric among addresses that bought Bitcoin close to the current price. As shown by the metric, the most important current zones of purchase are at $106,738 and $98,566. These two zones are where massive buying activity has occurred in the past few weeks, and they could act as support in case of a Bitcoin price crash. The first zone, between $104,982 and $108,190, contains 1.68 million addresses with a total volume of 1.28 million BTC at an average price of $106,738. Below the first zone, a larger group of 1.71 million addresses holds a greater volume of 1.25 million BTC within the price range of $95,248 to $98,566, with an average price of $98,566. As long as Bitcoin continues to trade above these levels, the ongoing rally could continue to push upward. However, if these pockets of demand are broken with enough selling pressure, the leading cryptocurrency could enter into an uncertain price zone with little buying interest to provide support. Speaking of selling pressure, on-chain data shows a slowing sell pressure among large holders. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, Bitcoin recorded its fifth straight week of net outflows from centralized exchanges. The past week alone saw more than $920 million worth of BTC moved into self-custody or institutional products, mostly Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Needs To Break Weekly Resistance For New Highs Even with solid demand zones beneath, Bitcoin’s path to new highs is not yet confirmed. Analyst Rekt Capital weighed in with his analysis, noting that Bitcoin is currently facing a strong weekly resistance band just under $109,000. Particularly, Bitcoin is at risk of a lower high structure on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Rekt Capital noted that a weekly close above the red horizontal resistance line must be achieved in order for Bitcoin to reclaim a more bullish stance. That resistance, which is currently around $108,890, is acting as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s upward rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest As such, Bitcoin would need to make a weekly close above $108,890 to position itself for new all-time highs. Unless there is a convincing break of that level, the price action of Bitcoin could be erratic and susceptible to a retracement to $106,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,160.

2025-07-06T12:25:00,"Summer’s top crypto picks: BTC is too expensive, but this $0.03 token might 10x","For most retail investors, buying into Bitcoin (BTC) at over $108,000 isn’t practical anymore. The upside might still be there, but getting meaningful returns requires capital that’s out of reach for the average trader. That’s why attention is rapidly shifting toward early-stage tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.03. It’s a strategic entry point for those looking to turn modest capital into something far more significant—just as early Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum investors once did. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into Phase 5 of its presale, having already raised over $11.7 million from more than 12,700 individual wallets. Over 60% of the tokens allocated for this round have been snapped up. What makes this project stand out is not just its low entry price, but the layered financial utility built into its ecosystem—especially through its mtTokens. One trader who moved $3,500 from Bitcoin (BTC) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) last month now holds over $5,400 in unrealized gains. That kind of growth, in just weeks, shows why smart capital is now rotating from high-cap legacy coins into more targeted, function-driven DeFi protocols. mtTokens deliver passive yield while expanding liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has engineered a unique mechanism to support long-term investor gains through mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens issued when users deposit assets into the protocol’s peer-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. These tokens are designed to grow in value automatically as interest accrues. There’s no need to claim rewards or actively reinvest; the mtTokens themselves reflect both the principal and the interest. What separates this system from standard yield platforms is the dual-layered benefit. First, users who deposit stable assets like USDT or top-tier coins like ETH or BTC are issued mtTokens on a 1:1 basis. Over time, these tokens increase in value as lending activity rises. Second, those same mtTokens can be staked in smart contracts to earn a share of the protocol’s revenue, which is used to buy back and distribute MUTM tokens to mtToken stakers. This creates a powerful flywheel effect. More users enter the system to earn yield. That demand drives up borrowing volume, which boosts protocol revenue. The system then recycles that income to reward long-term holders, applying buying pressure to MUTM and incentivizing staking. This structure is what separates utility tokens from hype coins—and why large holders are entering early with confidence. Stablecoin architecture unlocks additional value layers While many projects launch without foundational utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized, crypto-backed stablecoin system. This stablecoin will only be minted when users post approved collateral like ETH, and it will be burned as soon as loans are repaid or liquidated. Only verified issuers will be able to mint the coin, each with a strict cap to prevent excessive risk. The protocol will adjust interest rates dynamically to keep the stablecoin close to its $1 peg. If the price rises above $1, rates will drop. If it falls below, rates will climb. Arbitrage incentives will further reinforce stability, ensuring the asset maintains its target price. The introduction of this stablecoin will not only enhance user functionality but also support broader treasury utility across the platform. Mutuum’s approach offers direct benefits to those who understand the value of structured lending and borrowing. For example, users who deposit $15,000 in DAI will receive mtDAI, which compounds as interest builds over time. If pool utilization drives the APY to around 10%, that user would earn $1,500 over a year without moving their position. And since mtTokens can be staked for extra dividends, yield potential multiplies without added complexity. With over 4 billion MUTM tokens in total supply and a Phase 11 listing price set at $0.06, the upside from today’s $0.03 level is already tangible. Investors entering now double their position value right at the exchange listing. And with real protocol usage on the horizon—including a beta platform release alongside token launch—the stage is set for accelerated growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not aiming to be just another DeFi token—it’s building a complete infrastructure. With CertiK audit backing, a $50,000 bug bounty in place, and Layer-2 integration under development, the foundations are in motion to support serious on-chain activity. When SHIB moved from $0.000001 to $0.00008, most ignored it early. When BNB was $0.10, few thought it was worth the risk. Now, with Bitcoin (BTC) priced out of reach for most, investors are hunting for the next asymmetric bet. At just $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be that bet.

2025-07-06T12:17:19,"XRP Price Prediction: Is Consolidation Over? Crypto Michael’s Chart Hints at Explosive Move","XRP is trading at $2.27, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours and more than 3% over the past week. The recent momentum follows heightened speculation from technical analyst Crypto Michael, who highlighted XRP’s long-term consolidation phase. His chart, shared on X (formerly Twitter), shows XRP compressing for seven years inside a symmetrical triangle before breaking out in late 2024—a move that sparked a 700% surge from roughly $0.60 to over $2.00. XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Since then, XRP has been range-bound for seven months in what Michael describes as “healthy consolidation.” The chart identifies this post-rally phase as critical, with a white-circled zone indicating that prices are stabilising just above key resistance levels. Michael argues this consolidation phase is nearing completion. Importantly, XRP’s technical stability is unfolding while Bitcoin hovers near its own historic resistance—an 8-year trendline. Michael suggests that Bitcoin’s move above this line could serve as the macro trigger that lifts altcoins, such as XRP, into a fresh leg higher. XRP Technical Signals Hint at Bullish Breakout On the 4-hour chart, the XRP price prediction appears bullish, as XRP has reclaimed the $2.2175 level, now acting as short-term support. Price is also riding along a well-defined ascending trendline from late June, creating a pattern of higher lows. This bullish structure is reinforced by a recent bullish engulfing candle and rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now approaches the 60 mark but remains below overbought levels. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-SMA currently sits at $2.2175 and has been reclaimed, a positive signal for trend continuation. XRP is also reclaiming the mid-range of its prior swing, positioning it well for a breakout above $2.285. Key technical takeaways: XRP/USD trades bullish above 50-SMA and ascending trendline RSI is rising, indicating growing bullish momentum Resistance at $2.285, followed by $2.337 and $2.406 Support levels: $2.2175, $2.146, and $2.080 If XRP holds above $2.2175 and gains traction beyond $2.285, traders could see a push toward the $2.40–$2.47 range. XRP Trade Setup: Breakout Retest in Focus This setup favours breakout traders looking for confirmation and continuation. As XRP approaches $2.285 resistance, volume and candle structure will be key. Entry (Long): $2.27–$2.29 on strong breakout close Targets: $2.337 to $2.406 Stop-Loss: Below $2.21 to manage downside With RSI rising, price above trendline support, and consolidation nearing its end, XRP appears well-positioned for a decisive move—especially if Bitcoin breaks its own resistance in tandem.

2025-07-06T12:01:39,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Independence Day Weekend Sees BTC Hold Steady Around $108,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, hovering around the $108,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,498 but quickly lost momentum after sellers overwhelmed buyers at higher levels. As a result, the price briefly fell below $108,000 before consolidating around current levels. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return next week and BTC could retest the $110,000-$111,000 levels. Taxing Bitcoin Does Not Make Sense: Miller Value Partners Miller Value Partners' Chief Investment Officer, Bill Miller IV, believes the government has no right to tax Bitcoin because managing ownership rights does not require administrative efforts. Miller, known for his early advocacy of Bitcoin , stated that the flagship cryptocurrency does not require government infrastructure to verify or enforce property rights, unlike traditional assets such as real estate. Miller stated during a podcast, “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense. When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what. The reality is that if you think about why you pay taxes in society, it is to enforce property rights.” He added, “The government didn’t create Bitcoin, so that is an important point to keep in mind. The blockchain does that property automation for itself, right?” Miller also believes traditional asset managers face hurdles when buying Bitcoin due to the uncertainty around taxation. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out.” New Bitcoin Treasury Firms Could Struggle A crypto analyst has sounded an alarm over the Bitcoin treasury strategy, stating that newer firms could face significant challenges. The analysts stated that the strategy may not have the longevity many expect, warning that easy upside may already be behind new companies that have recently pivoted towards a Bitcoin treasury. The analyst stated, “My instinct is that the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect. For many new entrants, it could already be over.” According to the analyst, it's already an uphill battle for new Bitcoin treasury companies who are struggling to establish themselves as investors prefer early adopters. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche.” Analysts believe that some companies are employing a Bitcoin treasury strategy to generate a quick profit without fully understanding its long-term implications or the purpose behind it. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing. I think it’ll take them some time to figure out. The weak ones might be acquired at a discount by the strong ones, and the trend could still have a few more legs in it.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) price action has remained subdued over the holiday weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered considerable volatility over the week, dropping to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. The price recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $108,000 and briefly crossed $110,000 on Thursday before losing momentum. BTC’s current range extends from $98,000 to $110,000. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return once markets open, potentially pushing the price to a new all-time high. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, crossing $106,000 and settling at $106,137. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC crossed $107,000 and settled at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline below $107,000 to settle at $106,980. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Source: TradingView Despite the positive momentum, BTC dropped over 1% on Monday, slipping below $108,000 and settling at $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33% to $105,742. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% rise. BTC lost momentum on Friday as sellers overwhelmed buyers. As a result, the price fell 1.42% to $108,097. BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday but is back in the red during the ongoing session, trading around $108,145 as sellers look to drive the price below $108,000.

2025-07-06T12:00:50,"XRP Stern Critic Predicts 900,800% XRP Price Rally","Bitcoin advocate and author Jason Williams has sparked conversation within the XRP community after making a provocative statement on social media. On Thursday, Williams tweeted that XRP is “going to 20,000 per coin,” a comment that, at first glance, appeared to endorse the notion of an extraordinary price surge. However, his follow-up responses made it clear that the post was intended to be sarcastic. XRP is going to 20k a coin. — Jason Ai. Williams (@GoingParabolic) July 3, 2025 The tweet was a direct commentary on recent claims by some XRP supporters suggesting that the token could experience exponential growth, with projections reaching as high as $20,000 . While the claim might seem bullish, Williams used it to criticize what he sees as speculative and exaggerated price predictions. Clarifying the “20,000” Comment Following his initial post, Williams responded to skepticism in the comments by sharing an image that showed 20,000 Lebanese pounds converting to approximately $0.22. His caption read, “It will happen,” indicating that his earlier statement was not a price prediction in USD. Rather, he was suggesting that XRP’s value could drop dramatically, drawing a comparison to a currency that has undergone significant devaluation. This sarcastic tone was a clear attempt to highlight what he considers the unrealistic nature of recent bullish projections made by certain XRP proponents. Instead of predicting a price surge, Williams implied the opposite, that XRP might lose value, not gain it. The tweet appeared to respond directly to a theory that has recently resurfaced within the XRP community. Originally proposed in 2022 by game developer Chad Steingraber, the theory suggests that XRP could reach $20,000 per unit under a scenario of massive institutional adoption. According to Steingraber, if major financial institutions begin to use XRP for global transactions, and if private ledgers absorb much of the token’s supply, a supply shock could occur. This, combined with increased demand from wealthy investors and hedge funds, could, in theory, cause the token’s price to rise dramatically. He also claims that public access to XRP would decline to below 100 million tokens, leading to panic buying. Steingraber frames today’s retail market as only the early stage of XRP’s future use as the core of a new global financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Around the Valuation Critics, including Williams, challenge the plausibility of such projections. A $20,000 price point would require an XRP market capitalization that exceeds the total value of the current global financial system. With XRP’s circulating supply of over 50 billion tokens, a price of $20,000 would translate into a market cap in the hundreds of trillions or more, a figure that is widely regarded as economically unfeasible. While some XRP advocates argue that market capitalization is not the best indicator of value and may not apply to XRP’s unique use case, there remains no widely accepted financial model that supports such extreme valuations. Jason Williams’s tweet serves as a direct critique of what he views as unrealistic optimism regarding XRP’s future value. While some supporters continue to speculate about massive institutional adoption and future price spikes, Williams’s sarcastic commentary underscores the importance of grounding such discussions in economic reality. The debate reveals the growing divide between XRP’s most enthusiastic supporters and those who urge caution and critical analysis.

2025-07-06T11:46:56,"We Asked 4 AIs How High Ripple (XRP) Will Go in 2025: The Answers Might Shock You","TL;DR Ripple’s price actions are a big prediction topic within the cryptocurrency community, with analysts and believers rushing to offer their insights and forecasts. However, we decided to take a different approach this time and asked four of the biggest AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini) about their take on the matter. 2025 Price Targets All four AI solutions seemed very coherent about XRP’s price potential this year, as Perplexity explained it: “Ripple’s (XRP) price in 2025 is broadly expected to rise significantly from current levels, with expert forecasts varying but generally bullish.” Although Ripple’s cross-border token has stalled in the past few months and is actually slightly in the red since the start of the year, all AIs had similar conclusions about its price moves until the end of the year. ChatGPT laid out three potential scenarios, with the conservative one being at $3.4, which would match the asset’s all-time (and yearly) high. The optimistic is set at $5-$6, and the “aggressive forecasts” put the token at $10-$15 by the end of the year. Google’s Gemini had similar ideas in mind, saying that “a realistic high could be in the $5-$10 range.” Perplexity also joined the $5-$10 club, which could be reached under “favorable conditions” (more on that later). Grok was slightly more specific and was the only one that said XRP can finish the year lower than its current price tag. It noted that a “realistic price range” for the asset this year is somewhere between $1.8 and $5.81. Although that’s a pretty wide range, it concluded that the most likely peak will come somewhere between $3 and $4.5. The Favorable Conditions When it came down to outlining the factors that could impact XRP’s price moves this year, the AIs were once again aligned in their answers. First, they mentioned regulatory clarity and the official conclusion of the lawsuit against the SEC. Although Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in March that the case had been resolved and there had been several developments on the matter, the judge overseeing the case has yet to agree fully . Second, the AIs brought up institutional adoption and bullish partnerships, such as those with Santander, SBI Holdings, and others. A spot XRP ETF will also play a significant role in the asset’s price trajectory this year, if approved, said the chatbots. According to ETF experts, the current odds stand at nearly 100%. Lastly, the AI solutions highlighted the overall crypto market trends: “Bitcoin’s post-halving performance and a pro-crypto U.S. administration under President Trump could fuel bullish sentiment across the crypto market, benefiting XRP,” – answered Grok, which was similar to what the others had to say. Despite these bullish predictions for 2025, all four chatbots clarified that these are just that – speculative forecasts that might or might not come to fruition. Investors should do their own research before allocating funds to any cryptocurrency (or other asset, for that matter).

According to ABC 7 News, Tracy Jeffords received a text supposedly from the toll fees payment platform FasTrak after a journey to San Francisco. Convinced the text was genuine, the Lake County, California resident entered his debit card details to complete the payment. But a day later, Jeffords received an actual letter from FasTrak saying he owed the toll fees payment platform money. It was then that Jeffords checked his bank account only to find that more than $3,300 was missing after a purchase on eBay was made using his debit card information, according to the report. ABC 7 News cites Jeffords saying, “It made me feel terrible. And the thing is, it’s going to happen to somebody else.” The Lake County resident disputed the charge with Wells Fargo but the trillion-dollar bank has so far refused to reimburse. His attempt to dispute the charge with eBay has also proven unsuccessful. According to an expert contacted by ABC 7 News, getting reimbursed for fraudulent debit card purchases is harder than for those made using a credit card. Jeffords has nonetheless vowed to fight on to get his money back, according to the report. He tells ABC 7 News, “It’d be everything to get it back, because it’s a lot for me.

In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel says that a slowdown is approaching for the Bitcoin treasury business model as the market becomes too crowded and competitive. “The problem is what happens if the Bitcoin price stays flat or starts to go down? You said his stock was up over a five-year basis by a huge amount, which is true, but if you look at year-to-date at its performance compared to Bitcoin miners, you’re starting to see that that performance is running into headwinds. In theory, a Bitcoin treasury company’s price should increase by upwards of two times whatever the Bitcoin price is increasing on a daily basis because of the leverage that they’re driving. And that’s not the case anymore. I think what we’re starting to see is a saturation of the Bitcoin treasury business market because to your point, they’re not in any other business, they’re taking over a company with a marginally profitable business and they’re turning it into an accumulator for Bitcoin. At the end of the day, you have a bunch of people competing for capital, and that capital is going to the highest return, which means the lowest multiple to NAV (net asset value), and over time, that multiple to NAV is eventually going to go to zero…” Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet .

Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday, Miller argued that Bitcoin’s structure challenges traditional assumptions about taxation. “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense,” Miller said, emphasizing that while traditional assets depend on government systems to enforce and record property rights, Bitcoin operates independently on its blockchain. Blockchain Enforces Ownership, Not Governments Miller, an early advocate for Bitcoin , explained that the digital asset eliminates the need for the administrative infrastructure typically required to manage ownership of assets like real estate. “When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what,” he said. He argued that taxes exist to enforce property rights within society, a function that Bitcoin’s blockchain already fulfills without government intervention. “The blockchain does that property automation for itself,” Miller noted. He also pointed out that since governments did not create Bitcoin, the idea of taxing it in the same way as physical property becomes questionable. Earlier this year, rumors circulated that Eric Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, had proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on certain cryptocurrencies in the U.S. While Miller acknowledged the discussion around exempting BTC from capital gains tax , he remarked, “Whether that ultimately happens or not, who knows, but it is very cool that there is no wash sale rule on Bitcoin.” When asked whether Bitcoin could ever face property taxes similar to those imposed on real estate, Miller noted there is a “good argument” for why it should not. Tax Uncertainty Shows It’s Still Early for Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin’s growing adoption, Miller highlighted that tax uncertainties continue to hinder institutional investors. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out,” he explained. “That’s why I continue to say it is still early because the taxation rules around it are really interesting,” he added, underscoring the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding BTC. Miller IV is the son of veteran investor Bill Miller III, who in January 2022 revealed he had allocated 50% of his net worth to BTC and investments in major industry players, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy and mining firm Stronghold Digital Mining.

2025-07-06T11:17:06,"Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened","Coinbase Institutional Research President David Duong said that the claims of “the largest Ethereum (ETH) short position in history”, which have been on the agenda in the cryptocurrency market in recent days, do not reflect the truth. According to Duong, these comments, based on data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), actually point to arbitrage strategies by institutional investors. According to CFTC cash-secured fund data, leveraged funds’ ETH short positions on the CME rose from $466 million in early May to $1.6 billion as of June 24. This $1.14 billion increase is almost identical to the net $1.16 billion inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs in June. Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Duong said this parallel is no coincidence, arguing that the increasing institutional interest in ETH spot ETFs is triggered by the base yield difference on the CME. The yield difference between spot and futures prices, which was 6% on an annual basis in February, increased to 8%-9% in May and June. According to Duong, this situation presented an attractive opportunity for institutional investors looking to arbitrage: buying spot ETH and selling futures ETH at the same time. Ultimately, according to Duong’s analysis, the increase in short positions on CME is not a reflection of negative expectations for Ethereum, but rather institutional arbitrage activity. Therefore, the presentation of this situation as “the largest short position in history” does not reflect market reality, according to Duong. *This is not investment advice.

The 4-hour chart displays a tightening triangle, where ETH is forming higher lows while encountering horizontal resistance at $2,558. The trendline remains intact, and the 50-period simple moving average is currently at $2,494.95. Momentum is fading.

If bulls can’t hold above $2,478, ETH will visit deeper support at $2,388 and $2,320. If above $2,558, the uptrend will continue to $2,639 and beyond. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The EMA structure remains bullish, with the 50-SMA above the 100-SMA, indicating a positive medium-term outlook despite recent hesitation. ETF Momentum Adds Fuel to the Setup While the price is sideways, Ethereum’s fundamentals are strengthening. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently said Ethereum ETFs could see up to $10 billion in inflows by the end of 2025. So far in 2025, ETH ETFs have seen over $1.5 billion in inflows, including a record $1.17 billion in June. Hougan attributes the surge in inflows to Ethereum’s growing role in tokenised assets, such as stocks and stablecoins. As Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for regulated finance, it’s getting serious attention from traditional asset managers. And a favourable SEC ruling that crypto staking is not a securities offering opens the door for staking-enabled ETH ETFs – products that will attract institutional yield-seeking capital in the coming months. Ethereum Key Trade Setup – Watching the Triangle Edge The Ethereum price prediction is currently neutral, as the market awaits a potential breakout. This is a defined risk-reward setup for both bulls and bears. Here’s what to watch: Long Entry: Above $2,560 with volume confirmation Upside Targets: $2,639 to $2,723 Stop-Loss: Below $2,478 support Short Entry: Below $2,478 with a strong candle Downside Targets: $2,388 to $2,320 In summary, ETH is at a crossroads. The price is still range-bound, with ETF flows and staking providing the wind in its back. Above $2,560, and it could be a momentum play, but traders should be prepared to pivot; whoever gives up first will set the tone for Q3.

Undervalued At $110K According to Altcoin Daily, Bitcoin at $110,000 is “undervalued,” with the analysts arguing there’s plenty of room to run. That bold claim has fans cheering, and some even dream of $1,000,000 down the road. Bitcoin at $110k is undervalued! [screenshot this] — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) July 3, 2025 Other users have pushed back, asking what on‑chain data or metrics back up this view. They point out that until Bitcoin clears resistance at $110,500, a real breakout isn’t confirmed. Based on reports from market trackers, global liquidity is on the rise. Market observers picked up on that, saying more cash floating around can push Bitcoin higher. Rising liquidity often fuels big moves in risk assets. Still, traders keep an eye on futures funding rates and miner sell‑pressure, looking for clues if a pullback is brewing. Global Liquidity just hit a new ATH. Bitcoin will follow! pic.twitter.com/gH1Kl2D1Zw — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 3, 2025 Mixed Views Online Some followers argue that inflation and new tariffs could dampen Bitcoin’s rally. Others note that central banks are still buying time before any rate hikes, which may give crypto another boost. The back‑and‑forth on social media reads like a mini war room, with short comments and deep threads floating around. Plenty of voices, but few hard answers. Past Bull Runs Altcoin Daily wasn’t shy about past calls either. Just days earlier, they said that once Bitcoin tops $150,000, investors would wish they’d bought more at lower prices. That kind of hindsight talk can be stirring, but it doesn’t change the here‑and‑now charts or the macro calendar. Exec Calls For Hedge Based on remarks by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, now could be a good time to buy Bitcoin. Hougan pointed to Ray Dalio’s warnings about US debt, which has swelled past $7 trillion in annual spending against $5 trillion in revenue. With each household on the hook for roughly $230,000, Dalio says holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against future money‑print risks.

A solid break above $110,500 might pull in more buyers. But if inflation surprises on the upside or tariffs hit harder, odds could shift quickly. For now, Bitcoin’s story is still unfolding—and the next few days could tell us a lot about where it’s headed.

2025-07-06T10:33:03,"Drake References Bitcoin in New Track “What Did I Miss?”","Musical artist Drake has referenced Bitcoin in his latest song “What Did I Miss?”, released on Saturday, underscoring the digital asset’s expanding presence in mainstream culture. The mention appears in the song’s first verse, where Drake draws a comparison between Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and the ups and downs of public perception. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week. I don’t give a fuck if you love me. I don’t give a fuck if you like me,” Drake raps, capturing the resilience often associated with Bitcoin investors who continue to hold despite market swings. Drake’s connection to Bitcoin is not new. In 2022, the artist made headlines after wagering $1 million worth of Bitcoin on the Super Bowl matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams, reflecting his early interest in the asset class. Bitcoin Finds Place in Pop Culture Bitcoin references in popular music, television, and art are becoming increasingly common, signaling the digital asset’s gradual movement toward mass adoption. Similar to how past technologies like the internet and mobile phones crossed over into culture before widespread adoption, Bitcoin’s appearance in a Drake track adds another marker to its evolving narrative. In 2022, Blockware, a Bitcoin mining hardware provider, forecasted that global Bitcoin adoption would reach 10% by 2030, modeling the growth on historical adoption curves of paradigm-shifting technologies. Meanwhile, a March 2025 report by Bitcoin financial services firm River indicated that around 4% of the global population currently holds Bitcoin, with the asset still accounting for less than 1% of its total addressable market. River’s report also highlighted that adoption rates tend to be higher in developed nations, with institutional participation playing a key role in the current cycle of Bitcoin growth. Institutional Adoption Continues to Expand The increasing presence of Bitcoin-themed investment products , such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has further removed barriers to entry for both institutional and retail investors, enabling exposure without the complexities of self-custody or onchain transactions. Corporations including Strategy and Metaplanet have transitioned into Bitcoin treasury firms , while others have opted to hold smaller allocations as a hedge against inflation, geopolitical risks, and the uncertainty that comes with global fragmentation. These institutional moves align with Bitcoin’s emergence as a financial instrument with potential to protect value while signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term role. Drake’s lyrical nod to Bitcoin may be brief, but it underlines the asset’s ongoing shift from a niche financial experiment to a symbol within global culture.
