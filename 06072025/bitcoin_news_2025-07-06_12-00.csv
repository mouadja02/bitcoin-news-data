2025-07-06T09:47:08,"Renowned Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Price Targets of 400,000 and Then 1 Million Dollars for BTC","Famous Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger drew attention to the temporary advantages that interest rate cuts would provide to the fiat money system, but said that in the long run, Bitcoin could exceed $1 million with a strong uptrend. In his assessment on the social media platform X, Krueger argued that Bitcoin will continue to strengthen with the deflationary pressures that artificial intelligence will create in a low interest rate environment. The following statements stood out in Krueger's statement: “Reducing interest rates to 1% would give the fiat money system a 10-year breath. However, at the end of this period, artificial intelligence will come into play and create a strong deflationary effect. Bitcoin could exceed $400,000 or even $1 million much earlier and easily in this time period.” Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Stating that Bitcoin follows a long-term “power law” curve, Krueger argued that companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets (e.g. MicroStrategy, RIOT, MARA) are in a much stronger position than their competitors. He stated that these companies will gain serious advantages in the coming years thanks to their Bitcoin-focused strategies. For these reasons, Krueger stated that he predicts that many more companies will buy Bitcoin in the next 5 years. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-06T09:35:21,"Drake Compares Love Life to Bitcoin Price Swings in New Lyrics","Grammy-winning artist Drake has dropped a new song titled What Did I Miss? that compares his turbulent love life to the notorious volatility of Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: Drake compares his love life to Bitcoin’s price swings in his new song What Did I Miss?. His lyrics highlight Bitcoin’s growing presence in mainstream pop culture. Global BTC adoption sits at 4% today, far below forecasts of 10% by 2030. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week,” the Toronto rapper raps . This isn’t Drake’s first dance with Bitcoin. In 2022, he wagered $1 million worth of BTC on the Super Bowl, a move that grabbed headlines and underscored his willingness to engage with crypto beyond casual name-drops. Drake’s Lyrics Show Bitcoin Breaking Into Pop Culture Drake’s latest verse signals how Bitcoin continues to weave itself into mainstream culture, appearing not just in financial headlines but also in music, television, and art. As Bitcoin references pop up more often in pop culture, some see it as a sign that the digital asset is edging closer to widespread recognition. Historical forecasts from Blockware predicted Bitcoin adoption could reach 10% of the global population by 2030, comparing its trajectory to transformative technologies like electricity and the Internet. However, a recent report from River pegged current adoption at just 4%, showing that while crypto has made strides, there’s still a long road ahead. The report highlighted that adoption tends to be stronger in developed economies, where access to financial infrastructure and regulatory clarity is more robust. Meanwhile, institutional interest has continued to rise. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have pivoted to holding Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, aiming to guard against inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. Bitcoin ETFs and other investment products have further opened the door to retail and institutional investors, lowering barriers to exposure by removing the need for self-custody or direct onchain transactions. Bitcoin Adoption Gains Ground With Texas State Reserve Last month, Texas became the first U.S. state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, marking a significant step toward mainstreaming digital assets at the state level. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, setting up a standalone Bitcoin fund overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. Unlike previous attempts in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas’s Bitcoin reserve will operate entirely outside the state treasury, providing legal protections against routine fund reallocations. A companion bill, HB 4488, further secures the fund’s status, ensuring it remains intact regardless of future Bitcoin purchases. State Senator Charles Schwertner, the bill’s sponsor, argued that Texas should consider Bitcoin as it does land and gold, highlighting its performance over the past decade. Texas’s move comes as other states pull back from similar plans. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve .

2025-07-06T09:30:20,"Bitcoin Consolidation Continues: 2 Key Support Levels To Watch","Bitcoin (BTC) prices showed a sideways movement in the past day producing no significant changes. Following the recent rejection at the $110,000 price range, the maiden cryptocurrency failed to break out of a descending consolidatory channel; therefore, fears on the current status of the bull market remain intact. Amidst the current mood of uncertainty, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has identified two important support levels in the advent of a price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means On-Chain Data Reveals Strong Bitcoin Support At $106,500 And $98,500 In an X post on July 5, Ali Martinez shares a potentially impactful on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market. Using data from the In/Out Money Around Price (IOMAP) Chart from Sentora, the analyst shares that major support zones have emerged that could play a crucial role in shaping the BTC’s short-term price direction. The IOMAP chart analyzes Bitcoin wallet addresses and the average prices at which they acquired BTC, giving insights into potential zones of buying or selling pressure. Essentially, it shows where holders are currently in profit i.e. in the money” or at a loss i.e. out of the money. From the chart, it is observed that 1.68 million addresses bought 1.28 million BTC between $104,982 and $108,190, with an average acquisition price of $106,738. Historically, such large concentrations of buying activity tend to form strong support zones, as holders may defend their positions from slipping into loss. Therefore, this development makes the $106,700 range a formidable near-term support level. A second significant support level is identified in the $95,247 to $98,566 range, where 1.7 million addresses acquired 1.25 million BTC at an average price of $96,901. Should Bitcoin lose its footing above $106,000, this lower range would act as the next major cushion, potentially absorbing downward momentum. However, a decisive price close below $96,901 would confirm significant bearish intent by the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details Bitcoin Market Overview According to data from the IOMAP chart, around 89.36% of all BTC addresses are “in the money,” meaning their holdings were purchased at a lower price than the current market value. This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting the majority of market participants are in profit and thus less pressured to sell. Meanwhile, only 10.36% of addresses are “out of the money,” highlighting the relatively low risk of widespread panic selling, unless Bitcoin were to break below these critical levels highlighted above. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $108,154 reflecting a 0.24% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, it’s daily trading volume is down by 27.09% and valued at $31.04 billion.

2025-07-06T09:25:55,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? XRP Price Prediction As Ripple Moves Into Banking with FCC Filing","All eyes are on XRP right now after the recent filing of Ripple's banking application to the FCC. Considering this has happened just after Ripple's decision to p112ut an end to its standoff with the SEC, hopes have risen that XRP could make a comeback, perhaps even cross its $3 resistance in the coming days. This has given weight to the view that XRP could topple Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now, or does it merely hint at the arrival of investor opportunities with a variety of assets to pick from? Ripple Applying for National Bank Charter from the OCC - Brad Garlinghouse The announcement about Ripple's banking application was made by Brad Garlinghouse, who, on X, posted the news stating that this approach could put more federal oversight on Ripple, which could bolster its trust factor, transforming it into the bridge to connect traditional and decentralized financial institutions. However, that's not all, as the company has also filed for a Fed Master Account via Standard Custody. This could help Ripple to hold $RLUSD (Ripple Stablecoin) directly from the Fed and gain an additional layer of security. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Just as expected, community reactions to the news have been positive. Some have said this is a materialization of a dream consisting of Ripple becoming a bank, which clears the way for XRP to reach $100. However, others have asked how XRP will fit into the banking license. Impact of the News on the XRP Price While investors were expecting the news to have a major impact on the XRP price, that, unfortunately, wasn't the case. The DeFi token's value is still consolidating around the $2.2 level, and whatever green candles it was able to print were corrected the next day. That said, a macro-analysis of the price chart shows that the XRP price has been following an ascending channel ever since it dropped to the $1.9 level on June 22, and there have been no signs of the price action stopping. Furthermore, since the US government has been very progressive about crypto, chances are high that Ripple's application could be approved. That could help with streamlining crypto into the traditional financial space, giving XRP much-needed long-term upside. It is also possible for the crypto to reach $3 in the coming days. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now? The answer to this could arguably be yes. However, until the DeFi crypto crosses the $2.6 mark to retest the $3 level, investors should stay cautious, since it will only take one long red candle to change the course of the XRP price action. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Smart Investor Picks During the Current Ecosystem BTC Bull Ripple's growth would consolidate the market's belief that the altcoin season has indeed arrived. However, that does not mean Bitcoin would lose any of its shine, as despite all the news about Ripple's legal qualms, the apex crypto continues to be the major driver of the cryptocurrency market. BTC Bull is a project that taps into that particular market, offering users a standard meme coin experience with a robust touch. While no long-term use cases have been mentioned by the official website, the project has continued to delight customers thanks to its social media posts as well as unique mechanics. The project has tied its token burns and Bitcoin airdrop model with Bitcoin's growth, which is a subtle way to grow alongside the apex crypto. While this move could be seen as a gimmick by many, the fact that the project has managed to raise upwards of $8 million already means there could be more to the project than meets the eye. The token is launching soon, with an application to CoinGecko already filed. Furthermore, there are many analysts already bullish about the launch, stating that BTC Bull could achieve a 1000% growth after going live on the price charts. Snorter Another crypto that could be considered one of the top offerings among crypto pre-sales is Snorter . Snorter is a meme coin powering an automated crypto trading bot that lets investors find and trade top-performing Solana cryptos. What further elevates the appeal of Snorter is the fact that it is accessible via Telegram. Being one of the leading messaging apps for crypto gives it access to a range of unique attributes. Not only is the platform easy to use, but the automated sniping tool is also equipped with all kinds of security features. In addition to the perks that come with the bot, Snorter is also very up to the mark when it comes to highlighting its memes. The main animal chosen to highlight this project, an aardvark, has been used to draw an equivalence between an aardvark's snout that it uses to fetch and Snorter's approach to sniffing the best cryptocurrency investment projects. While Snorter's connection to XRP isn't direct, the fact that XRP has the potential to become the biggest altcoin ultimately means unique projects with niche perks could gain community attention quickly. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a cryptocurrency project whose core idea is to inject utility into the Bitcoin network, and it aims to accomplish this using Bitcoin's first L2 scaling solution. The tech-related documents of the project show that developers are hard at work, trying to make it a reality. Three technologies have been implemented for this purpose: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge. The L2 scaling solution will reportedly help the Bitcoin network's transaction mechanics through off-chain aid. With the Solana Virtual Machine, developers are hoping for more DeFi applications to be built on the Bitcoin network, and with a Canonical Bridge, communications will be established between Bitcoin Hyper and Bitcoin. It is the project's simple premise that has allowed it to gain so much momentum, and in presale it has raised close to $2 million already. So, for XRP fans looking for an offbeat crypto with a strong focus on utility, Bitcoin Hyper could be a good investment. Conclusion Ripple's entry into the banking sector could lead to a major shift in the world of crypto. It could signal crypto to become more mainstream, leading to increased participation. Tokens that are still available on presale could take advantage of this situation, surging upon launch. Therefore, this ""best crypto to buy now list"" focuses on cryptocurrency ICOs. Each ICO has its own unique attribute, giving traders the opportunity to diversify their investments. And as crypto goes mainstream, these picks could yield massive gains, both in the short and the long term. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-06T09:23:51,"Brazil’s Central Bank Hack Sparks $40M Crypto Laundering in BTC, ETH","A sophisticated cyberattack on C&M Software, a technology provider for Brazil’s Central Bank, has triggered a wave of crypto laundering, with at least $40 million in stolen funds funneled into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Key Takeaways: Hackers stole nearly $148 million from Brazilian banks by breaching C&M Software’s systems. At least $40 million was laundered into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, according to ZachXBT. Authorities froze $50 million linked to the hack, but much of the stolen crypto remains missing. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged the laundering after tracing large sums moving through Latin American over-the-counter desks and exchanges. The attack stands as one of Brazil’s most significant financial breaches to date. Hackers Target C&M, Key Link to Brazil’s PIX Payment Network The hack targeted C&M, a key intermediary connecting smaller banks and fintechs to the Central Bank’s infrastructure, including PIX, the country’s widely used instant payments system. According to Brazilian authorities, hackers exploited credentials sold by João Nazareno Roque , a 48-year-old IT worker at C&M, who received the equivalent of $2,770 for his corporate login details. Local news outlet g1 Globo reported that Roque didn’t just sell his credentials; he also assisted in building a system to facilitate the theft, netting an additional payment of about $1,800. Using this inside access, hackers orchestrated a coordinated attack early on June 30, siphoning approximately 800 million reais, or nearly $148 million, from reserve accounts of six financial institutions. $140M HACK in Brazil – Insider Sold Access for Just $2.7K?! ZachXBT reports a $140M breach in Brazil, where an insider allegedly sold system access for only $2.7K. Around $30–40M was funneled into crypto via LatAm OTC desks. One of the biggest insider leaks in recent memory?… pic.twitter.com/ehMqjuQGCi — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 4, 2025 The fraudulent transfers went undetected for nearly two and a half hours. The breach only came to light when BMP, one of the affected institutions, flagged suspicious transactions. BMP’s CEO, Carlos Benitez, said his bank alone lost roughly $73.8 million but managed to recover about $29.5 million. A Brazilian court has since frozen accounts suspected of receiving stolen funds, recovering approximately $50 million so far. However, the full scope of the laundering operation remains under investigation, with significant sums still unaccounted for. Following the incident, the Central Bank suspended parts of C&M’s access to its systems as authorities worked to contain the damage. Roque was arrested on July 3, two days after the hack, and remains in custody as the investigation continues. Officials said no retail customers suffered direct losses, as the stolen funds were limited to institutional reserve balances held at the Central Bank. Crypto Networks Emerge as Escape Route for Crimes The latest breach underscores growing fears about crypto’s role as a conduit for conventional financial crimes. Digital assets offer liquidity and a level of pseudonymity that traditional cash transactions can’t match, enabling swift movement of illicit funds at scale. Stablecoins, in particular, have drawn the attention of criminal networks. The Financial Action Task Force recently warned that stablecoins pose increasing risks when used by illicit groups, especially in the absence of coordinated global oversight. Brazil’s recent heist mirrors a series of high-profile crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit hack and Chinese authorities dismantling a $136 million laundering ring that used digital currencies for cross-border money flows. Nevertheless, Brazilian officials are now working to trace the stolen funds across various blockchain networks, coordinating with international agencies to freeze assets and identify those responsible for one of the nation’s largest financial cyberattacks.

2025-07-06T09:15:30,"Hot FOMO Bull Market for Bitcoin Likely Approaching As BTC Indicator Begins To Inch Upward: PlanB","Widely followed quant analyst PlanB says that one indicator is suggesting a return to a FOMO (fear of missing out)-style bull market for Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new video update, PlanB tells his 215,000 YouTube subscribers that the crypto king’s rising relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures when an asset is overbought or oversold, suggests that rallies are coming over the next several months. According to the analyst, based on historical precedent, if BTC can hit an RSI of 75 on the monthly chart, a months-long “hot” FOMO bull market will follow. “We had some FOMO and disappointment last year, and that’s why this RSI average shows a little wobble here. Well, I expected [that], and actually, that’s what we’re seeing last month. It picked up the upward slope again. So I expect [BTC] to continue toward [an RSI of] 75, because if you look here in 2019, after the wobble, it returned to the former levels before the wobble. We have seen 75 RSI already three or five times, so I think we’re going to return to that level… That means if that were to happen this month in July, then July would [see BTC] end at $125,000ish… And after that, of course, I expect some really hot FOMO bull months of 80 RSI, 80+ like we’ve seen in all the bull markets. Even the lousy 2021 bull markets had five months above RSI 80. So that’s what I expect.” Source: PlanB/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $107,992 at time of writing.

2025-07-06T09:00:26,"XRP Likely Price if Bitcoin Hits $21 Million As Michael Saylor Predicted","Recent discussions surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term price potential have sparked broader interest in how such gains could influence other digital assets. Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor’s ambitious forecast of Bitcoin reaching $21 million has reignited speculation within the crypto community, including what this could mean for XRP. Saylor’s $21 Million Bitcoin Forecast Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference, Michael Saylor outlined a future scenario where Bitcoin could attain a valuation of $21 million within the next 21 years. His outlook is based on a combination of factors, including evolving global regulatory frameworks and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Saylor emphasized that these developments could contribute to unprecedented long-term growth in the asset’s price. While his prediction focuses solely on Bitcoin, it naturally invites speculation about potential impacts on other cryptocurrencies, particularly those that tend to follow Bitcoin’s general market direction. XRP, despite operating on a different infrastructure and use case, is often influenced by the broader market trends initiated by Bitcoin. How XRP Reacts to Bitcoin Trends Historically, XRP’s price behaviour has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s movements . When Bitcoin experiences sustained growth or decline, altcoins like XRP tend to reflect similar patterns, although not always at the same scale. For instance, downturns in Bitcoin typically coincide with broader market corrections, while Bitcoin’s recoveries frequently spark renewed momentum across other assets. Given this correlation, a hypothetical increase in Bitcoin’s price from its current level of approximately $107,000 to $21 million would represent a growth rate of approximately 19,526%. If XRP were to appreciate at the same relative rate, its future value could be projected accordingly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Value in a $21 Million Bitcoin Scenario At the time of writing, XRP is priced at $2.22 . If XRP were to follow Bitcoin’s projected trajectory and experience a similar 19,526% increase, its future price would be approximately $431 per token. This estimate is purely theoretical and assumes a direct proportional relationship between the two assets’ price movements over the coming two decades. To illustrate the potential financial implications, an investment of $10,000 in XRP at its current price would yield approximately 4,545 tokens. If the token value reached $431, this holding would be worth over $1.95 million by 2046. However, this projection is speculative and dependent on numerous variables, including market adoption, regulation, institutional participation, and overall sentiment toward digital assets. Uncertainty in Long-Term Projections While optimistic forecasts like Saylor’s attract attention and can influence investor sentiment, it is important to recognize the uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions. There is no assurance that Bitcoin will achieve a $21 million valuation or that XRP will appreciate in direct correlation. Market dynamics, competitive technology, legal developments, and macroeconomic factors all play a significant role in shaping outcomes in the cryptocurrency space. While theoretical calculations provide interesting insights into potential returns, they should not be mistaken for guaranteed outcomes.

While most larger-cap alts have produced insignificant gains, TON and BONK have emerged as the biggest gainers on a relatively calm Sunday morning. BTC Calm at $108K It has been a quiet period for the primary cryptocurrency. In fact, the latest major price moves came about two weeks ago – on June 23 and 24 – when it dumped to $98,000 before it soared past $105,000 a day later as the Middle East war was going rampantly. Ever since then, though, the asset has been stuck in a tight trading range between $105,000 and $110,000. It tested the lower boundary on Wednesday, where the bulls stepped up and pushed it south toward the upper one. On Thursday, BTC showed signs of a breakout attempt when it spiked to a multi-week peak of $110,500, but the bears stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a surge to a new all-time high. The landscape has been somewhat unchanged since then, as bitcoin quickly returned to $108,000 and has not moved from that level for a few days. Its market capitalization stands strong at $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at over 63% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BONK on the Run As the graph below will demonstrate, most larger-cap alts are slightly in the green on a daily scale. Such minor increases are evident from the likes of ETH, BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, BCH, LINK, and XRP. In contrast, HYPE and PI have lost some traction over the past 24 hours. The biggest gainers are TON and BONK. The former has risen by over 9% and sits at $3, while the meme coin has exploded by 20% and now trades at $0.000022.

2025-07-06T08:29:19,"Crypto tax evaders to face fines in the United Kingdom","United Kingdom ministers have launched efforts to crack down on crypto traders who try to evade payment of taxes on their profits. Holders of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP are expected to pay tax on profits generated from trading the assets, a rule that has been in place for a while. Meanwhile, under the new rules , crypto traders will face fines of up to £300 if they fail to provide their personal details to the cryptocurrency service providers they use to make sure they are paying the right amounts to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The government expects that the new crypto tax rule, which is known as the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework and would take effect from January, to raise about £315 million by April 2030. Crypto tax evaders to face fines in the United Kingdom According to the new rules, any crypto service providers that also fail to provide accurate details about transaction and tax reference numbers are expected to also face fines. James Murray MP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, talked about the new rules. “We’re going further and faster to crack down on tax dodgers as we close the tax gap. By ensuring everyone pays their fair share, the new crypto reporting rules will make sure tax dodgers have nowhere to hide, helping raise the revenue needed to fund our nurses, police, and other vital public services,” he said. The new rule comes after Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to rule out the possibility of tax increases after the United Kingdom government made a U-turn on welfare reforms. The Chancellor, whose tears in the Commons spooked the financial market, said she was not going to apologize for trying to make sure that the numbers add up. “But we do need to make sure that we’re telling a story and a Labour story. We did that well in the Budget and Spending Review, we increased taxes on the wealthiest and businesses,” she said. When asked whether she was prepared to rule out further tax rises, she said it was not going to happen, because it would be “irresponsible for a Chancellor to do that.” Crypto users criticize the new tax rules The new rules, which are expected to take effect in January 2026, will see crypto traders providing certain useful and identifying details to any service provider they use to buy, sell, transfer, or exchange digital assets. The information given to the service provider will ensure each trader’s details will be linked to their tax record, making it easier for the United Kingdom government to find out how much tax they need to pay. Users need to provide information like their full name, date of birth, address, and country where they stay (if they do not live in the United Kingdom). They are also required to present their tax identification number, and in the case of businesses, the legal business name and main business address. Crypto services required to collect this information include crypto exchange applications, online marketplaces where users buy and sell NFTs and services that manage crypto portfolios for users. The new rule has generated quite a buzz among crypto traders in the United Kingdom, with one user noting that it is a win-win for the government. “So you invest what savings you managed to save and buy crypto. If they make a profit, the government tax you but if you make a loss the government aren’t going to be interested, so it’s a win-win for the government,” the user said. Another user argued that they have paid tax on everything they used to set up their small-scale mining hardware, asking the need to pay tax on the profits from her business.

BofA’s Global Fund Manager Survey, which polled 190 respondents overseeing $523 billion in wealth, finds that 54% of managers believe that international equities will be the best-performing asset class in the next five years, reports Investing.com. Meanwhile, 23% picked US equities, 13% had their eye on gold and 5% chose bonds. Looking closer at the equities market, BofA’s monthly survey shows that fund managers are increasing their allocation in eurozone and emerging market (EM) stocks while trimming positions in US names. Specifically, they are bullish on stocks trading in the energy and banking sectors as they move capital away from staples, utilities and healthcare. As for the US dollar, the fund managers are at their most underweight position in the American currency since 2005, as 35% say they have larger positions in other currencies. BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says, “[The] biggest summer pain trade is long the buck.” The poll also finds that “long gold” is still the most crowded trade, with 41% bullish on the precious metal. At the same time, optimism for the Magnificent 7 appears to be waning, with just 23% holding long positions. Based on the results of the June survey, BofA says the most contrarian trades include long US dollar, short gold; long US equities, short eurozone stocks and long consumer stocks, short banks.

2025-07-06T08:09:15,"Huge BTC Whale That Panicked Over Yesterday’s FUD on Bitcoin Made Massive Trades Today","A crypto whale may have temporarily panicked after yesterday's events and sold a large amount of Bitcoin. As is known, yesterday a cryptocurrency whale that had been sleeping since 2011 woke up and moved 80,000 BTC worth approximately $8 billion. A crypto whale, likely caught up in the wave of FUD from yesterday’s incident, moved 1,550 BTC, or approximately $167 million worth of assets, to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. However, despite the wave of FUD, Bitcoin price has increased by 0.11% since yesterday and is trading above $108,000 at the time of writing. Related News: The US Government's Chief Advisor on Cryptocurrencies, Bo Hines, Reveals His Big Prediction About Cryptocurrencies There is also speculation about the identity of the big whale, who has not sold yet and has simply moved his assets to another crypto wallet. Some low-level evidence suggests that this whale could be Roger Ver, a former BTC supporter and now the founder of another cryptocurrency called Bitcoin SV. Roger Ver is one of the early supporters of BTC, and it is thought that Ver may be preparing a deal with the IRS, the US tax authority, behind the movement of this amount of BTC. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-06T08:00:38,"Bitcoin Outflow Ratio Mirrors 2023 Accumulation – Long-Term Bullish Signal?","Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below its $112,000 all-time high, with bulls firmly defending the $108,000 level as short-term support. This narrow range has created a tense but bullish environment as traders and investors await a decisive move that could shape the market’s direction in the months ahead. Top analyst Darkfost highlights a notable trend: outflows continue to dominate, reinforcing long-term investor confidence. This pattern suggests that rather than exiting the market, seasoned holders are moving BTC off exchanges, typically a sign of reduced selling pressure and strong conviction. It’s not difficult to see why confidence is building. Bitcoin adoption is steadily growing among major corporations and government institutions alike. The digital asset is no longer seen purely as a speculative tool but is increasingly being positioned as a long-term store of value. From corporate treasury strategies to nation-state interest, Bitcoin is gradually becoming embedded in broader financial infrastructure. Bitcoin Range-Bound As Long-Term Confidence Builds Bitcoin is currently trading within a tight range between $103,000 and $110,000. This range has persisted for several weeks, creating a buildup in momentum that suggests a breakout is imminent. A decisive move above $110K could push Bitcoin into price discovery, while a breakdown below $103K would likely trigger an accelerated downside. For now, the market remains in wait-and-see mode. Macroeconomic uncertainty is beginning to ease, with more clarity emerging around interest rate policy and global growth expectations. Many analysts believe that a new bullish phase could unfold in the coming months. Still, risks remain. US Treasury yields are climbing once again, and inflation continues to show signs of persistence—two variables that could dampen market sentiment if they worsen. Despite these headwinds, long-term investor confidence appears strong. Darkfost notes that outflows are once again dominating the market. The monthly outflow/inflow ratio has fallen to 0.9, a level not seen since the depths of the 2023 bear market. A ratio below 1 typically signals sustained demand on the spot market, as coins are being withdrawn from exchanges rather than prepared for sale. This behavior reflects growing conviction among long-term holders. Bitcoin is increasingly being embraced by corporations and even governments as a strategic reserve asset. It is gradually evolving into a modern-day store of value, used to bolster treasury allocations and reduce exposure to fiat currency risks. As outflows continue and adoption grows, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. The current range may only be a pause before the next major move—one that could define the trajectory of the market heading into Q3 and beyond. BTC Consolidates Below Resistance The 3-day Bitcoin chart shows continued consolidation just below the $109,300 resistance level, with support holding firm near $103,600. This range has defined recent price action, and the low volatility hints at an impending breakout. Notably, BTC remains well above its key moving averages—the 50 SMA at $95,655, the 100 SMA at $90,529, and the 200 SMA at $73,817—suggesting the bullish trend remains intact on the higher timeframe. Despite repeated tests, buyers have yet to break above $109,300 with conviction. However, the series of higher lows since mid-April indicates consistent bullish pressure building beneath resistance. A breakout above the $112K all-time high would mark a major technical shift and push BTC into price discovery, with upside momentum likely accelerating rapidly. Volume remains relatively low, indicating market participants are waiting for a catalyst to confirm direction. Until then, traders are likely watching for another retest of the lower boundary of the range or a decisive move above resistance. As long as BTC maintains its current structure and key support holds, bulls remain in control. A close above the resistance zone would set the stage for the next leg up in this bullish cycle.

2025-07-06T08:00:07,"Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason","Altcoins have spent the past few years under the shadow of Bitcoin’s dominance, struggling to reclaim relevance as capital and attention largely concentrated on BTC. But the tide may be turning. Since April, the Total 2 — a metric representing the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin — has climbed 35%, signaling a potential shift in momentum toward altcoins. This recovery marks one of the strongest altcoin performances in recent years and has reignited hopes of a broader market expansion beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Daan has weighed in on this development, highlighting a key technical formation: a higher low on the Total 2 chart during the recent market bounce. This structure is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that investors are stepping in to accumulate altcoins at increasingly higher price levels. If confirmed with a higher high in the coming days or weeks, this could mark the start of a sustainable altseason. As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, altcoins could see renewed interest from traders and investors. The next key test will be whether bulls can reclaim higher levels and flip the broader altcoin market structure definitively back to bullish. Altcoins Prepare For A Breakout Altcoins remain about 50% below their all-time highs, but bulls are setting the stage for what could be an expansive move in the coming weeks. After months of underperformance, the broader altcoin market is beginning to show early signs of structural recovery. Ethereum — the market’s leader among altcoins — has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May, and many analysts believe that a breakout in ETH could serve as the catalyst for a broader altcoin rally. Daan recently highlighted a key technical development: the Total 2 Altcoin Market Cap has made a higher low during the latest bounce, a structure that often precedes bullish continuation. This higher low suggests growing demand and reduced downside pressure, both of which are critical to establishing a sustainable uptrend. The key area to watch is the 2024 high setback in May. If bulls can push Total 2 above that level, it would confirm a higher high — the final piece needed to flip the high timeframe structure decisively back to bullish. That breakout would likely usher in renewed momentum across mid- and small-cap tokens, fueling what many hope will be the long-awaited altseason. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern, but signs of accumulation are growing stronger. If Ethereum can break out of its multi-month range, the altcoin market could rapidly reprice, erasing months of losses and opening the door to a new wave of capital rotation out of Bitcoin dominance. As long as key levels hold and risk appetite improves, the foundation is in place for altcoins to make a significant move higher. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH/BTC Chart Signals Turning Point The ETH/BTC chart reveals a critical moment for the altcoin market. After a prolonged downtrend that began in late 2022, Ethereum has stabilized near the 0.023 BTC level, forming a potential bottom. While the pair remains well below the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages—indicating continued bearish pressure—momentum appears to be shifting. Since bottoming out in mid-June, ETH/BTC has held its ground and is attempting to build a base, with early signs of accumulation. However, without a clear breakout above resistance zones, particularly around the 0.025–0.027 BTC range, bulls will struggle to confirm a trend reversal. A decisive move above these levels would be the first major confirmation of strength for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? This breakout is essential for altseason. Historically, altcoin rallies are triggered when ETH outperforms BTC, drawing capital into mid- and small-cap tokens. Without ETH leading, altcoins tend to lag as Bitcoin dominance remains high.

2025-07-06T07:24:45,"Ethereum Price Fell 2% In June But Has These 4 Bullish Signs Going Into July","June was a lackluster month for crypto market gains amid global uncertainty looming over international tariff policy and the future direction of US central bank rates. US Stocks Outpaced Ethereum In June For the 30 day window ending Friday, Jun. 27, the S&P 500 Index gained +4.25%. The push overcame serious resistance from the tariff nail biters and took the broad US stock benchmark to a historic record close Friday. But after running from $76,200 on 4/8 to $111,600 on 5/22, a +46% gain in a little over a month, Bitcoin’s price took some time to cool down in June. The cryptocurrency charted minor gains, which could be seen as a positive in the face of massive international turmoils and geopolitical shocks. Meanwhile, Ethereum corrected by 24% before bouncing off the Jun. 22 support to finalize a 2% loss for the 30 days ending Friday, Jun. 30th. So does ETH have a problem that Bitcoin doesn’t? Not really. Ethereum is a smaller currency by market cap, about 14% of Bitcoin’s size. Traders still perceive it as a more speculative bet. So it tends to move in the same direction as BTC — by larger percentages. That means on the way down, losses are frequently greater. But on the way up, gains are often greater too. For example, during the crypto market’s rally from early April through early June, Bitcoin made a +46% gain. But during the same rally, Ethereum gained +100%, rising from the $1,400 handle to the $2,800 level. Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts Double rainbow all the way across the sky? Bitcoin is by and large the biggest leading indicator for the rest of the crypto market’s prices, including Ethereum. It appears to have a long ways to go before topping out this year or next. Based on popular and authoritative analysts’ price targets for Bitcoin in 2025, it’s pacing to enter July and Q3 at 50% to 66% of its peak price before this cycle is over. That means it could double or gain by half again its June price levels before the year is over. Standard Chartered, Bernstein, Galaxy Digital, and Peter Brandt all expect $150,000 to $200,000 for BTC sometime in the next six months. Bitcoin’s long-term price trend rainbow chart confirms these projections. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s own long-term trend chart is shaping up to signal a three-peat of a multi-year trend. If it happens the way it did the last two major market cycles, this Ether prices could be primed to rise by more than Bitcoin’s during the next big monthly rally. Source: X If it turns out to be Bitcoin’s final push for its peak on this cycle as market watchers expect, Ethereum’s gains could signal the start of this cycle’s alt season in meme coins and Layer 2 app tokens. In addition to the market technical setup for ETH prices in Q3, here are four further bullish signals supporting the leading smart contract platform’s price gains in July. 1. Who Will Win Ethereum L2 Fee Wars? Ethereum’s price has taken time to absorb the shock of the Dencun upgrade on Mar. 13, 2024. The upgrade lowers rates for Layer 2 apps to lock in tranches of transaction updates with the base layer chain. In the 15 months since, developers have deployed a number of new apps with currencies that offer Ethereum services for lower fees. The base chain’s fee revenue dropped from $30 million annually to $500,000 by Q1 of this year. That saves users money, but a lot of Ethereum stakers who had their money parked in staking contracts to earn that fee revenue felt inclined to move it somewhere that it could still earn returns on their savings. This is a massive factor in Ethereum’s sluggish price growth compared to Bitcoin’s over the past year. But it’s not that the latter is falling behind its competitors like Solana and Ripple. When factoring in the growth of the post-Dencun L2 coins on Ethereum— like Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Movement (MOVE), and Starknet (STRK)— the money mostly didn’t leave Ethereum and go to its competitors. It went to another layer, powered by and supporting the base chain. For that reason, Ethereum may be undervalued by a large number of the cryptocurrency market’s headline readers that don’t understand what happened. Ethereum Identity Crisis? Some have referred in the mean time to this awkward stage in Ethereum’s growth as an identity crisis. It’s an open platform and anyone can build on it in any way that the code can handle. The question for Vitalik Buterin and crypto market investors who show up to value early is: Will one of the slew of Ethereum scale and fee apps, some new app we haven’t heard of yet, or an upgrade be what implements the best ultra long term, future proof, platform-wide standardizations that define the network’s global advantages? Find the answer to that question and you’re doing some real work. 2. SharpLink $30M ETH Buy In another positive development, the corporate treasury race that started for Bitcoin supplies continues to rock the Ethereum markets. SharpLink Gaming, bought another $30 million worth of ETH just before the Ether price chart threw a small cup and handle pattern. But why does this matter? Well, let’s see what happened to STrategy. Led by founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, Tyson’s Corner, Virginia-based Strategy Inc. and Bitcoin have both benefited from the company’s pivot in 2020 to simply pile up as much BTC as it can hold on to forever. As a result of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity with investors since then, MSTR stock rallied 566% in under 11 months from $63 per share on Jan. 5, 2024 to a price peak of $420 on Nov. 22, 2024. Over that same time, the S&P 500 Index rallied 27% from the 4697 level to 5969. Every $100 spent on Strategy stock on Jan. 5 last year could be sold for $666 dollars on Nov. 22, paying back buyers $566 for saving their $100 with MSTR shares for a term of 11 months. That’s like a downpayment on a new car lease with a high credit score. Meanwhile, $100 spent on an S&P 500 ETF would have returned buyers $27. That’s more like a cheap dinner out for two. All for the same hundred bucks and the same 11 months. That suggests regulated Wall Street investors wanted on to the Bitcoin bandwagon and found a way in Strategy stocks. Seeing the bullishness of corporate finance, Internet crypto markets were now racing Strategy to accumulate a scarce supply of BTC tokens. Now, SharpLink is doing it again with ETH. The company’s stocks spiked over 8 days in late May from $3.76 per share to just under $80 a share as Wall Street rewarded the former gaming company for pivoting to accumulating a regulated corporate Ether treasury. 3. $39M ETH Whale Bite Meanwhile, an Ethereum whale took a $39 million chomp out of the crypto dip on 6/22. Ethereum’s forward outlook was too good for this whale not to bite at that 24% off discount tag. Every token is a vote with a daily trading value that fluctuates on a global open market of crypto exchanges. Participants “vote” by locking, unlocking, moving, and swapping currencies, as often as they like, any time they like. When crypto investors take Ether tokens off a crypto exchange, the remaining supply of ETH tends to attract higher prices at the point of sale. But when they stake ETH for yield, it creates even more support. 4. Bit Digital Drops $34M BTC for ETH Not to be outdone by SharpLink, publicly traded, New York-based blockchain company Bit Digital, announced on 6/25 it is giving up $34 million worth of BTC tokens to move the proceeds into Ether and develop staking strategies. They might profit well from determining in advance of the overall market which of the Ethereum scale and fee coins will deliver the most yield and gains together over timespans relevant to their balance sheet and calendar.

2025-07-06T07:04:23,"Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya Says Continued US Dollar Decay May Not Be a Bad Thing – Here’s Why","Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya believes that a long-term decline of the US dollar is not an existential concern for America. In a new episode of the All-In podcast, host Jason Calacanis highlights that the US dollar index (DXY) witnessed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years after losing nearly 11% of its value against other major currencies in the first six months of 2025. While Calacanis describes the slump as “shocking,” Palihapitiya argues that the dollar has been in decline for decades, and it’s not a major concern because the gains from US assets have consistently outweighed the currency’s depreciation. “This has been a one-way trade for a very long time, and it’s probably important to understand why that is. And I think it generally has to do with the fact that the United States finances a lot of growth, and that has been the right decision. Unless you see a complete collapse in the currency, I suspect that this decay continues to happen. So the question is, is it a bad thing? And the answer is it depends. Because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues, you’re still ahead… If you look at asset prices in the United States relative to asset prices any place else in the world, it is the flight to quality, which is to say it is the thing that everybody wants to own. And you see that in the equity markets, you see it in real estate, you see it in hard assets… The reality is that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than they want to own other assets and those assets are dollar-denominated.” Palihipatiya also highlights that there will be a constant demand for dollar-denominated assets as long as “there’s American ingenuity and American supremacy,” which would meaningfully offset the downside of holding USD.

2025-07-06T06:32:58,"XRP Proponent Warns Bitcoin Holders: Michael Saylor Is a Government Contractor","The Bitcoin community has celebrated the digital asset’s climb past $110,000 in 2025 as evidence of its growing global relevance. Yet beneath the surface, not all voices share the optimism. Over 10,000 BTC, worth more than $1 billion, was recently moved from a wallet that had been inactive since 2011 . Following that, multiple similar wallets were activated, and a total of 80,009 BTC, worth almost $9 billion, was moved to unknown wallets. The transfers prompted speculation among many crypto holders, but Bitcoin advocates largely dismissed the event as routine. However, XRP proponent Edoardo Farina views it as a sign of deeper instability. Farina’s Warning to Bitcoin Holders In a recent post , Farina stated that the Bitcoin community is “completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face,” asserting that they are “blinded by arrogance” and unable to see the broader implications. For Farina, the timing and nature of these moves suggest something more than mere internal transfers. Though none of the funds appear to have entered centralized exchanges, the scale of the movement has unsettled some market watchers, and some anticipate an upcoming sell-off. Farina argues this is precisely the kind of event the Bitcoin community refuses to analyze critically. The BTC community is completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face. Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses. Blinded by arrogance, they unable to spot the RED flags. But in time, their fall will be the lesson. We tried to warn them. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went further in questioning the motivations of Bitcoin figureheads, alleging that Michael Saylor, who has been called Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , is part of a coordinated effort to mislead. “Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses,” Farina wrote, reinforcing a narrative he has promoted in previous critiques of institutional involvement in Bitcoin. Possibility of Future Sell-Offs The suggestion that these dormant wallets could eventually be used to liquidate large holdings is not unprecedented. Historically, early miner wallets have rarely moved funds unless some form of realization, profit-taking, transfer of custody, or structural risk management was involved. A similar event occurred in March 2024 after a wallet that had stayed dormant for 14 years sold its BTC at an all-time high. The 2025 wallet reactivations mirror those concerns. If such holders begin to exit positions during heightened optimism, Bitcoin could be exposed to swift downward pressure. Is Bitcoin’s Downfall Coming? Critics of Farina often dismiss his perspective as tribalism. However, the scale and timing of the recent wallet moves lend some weight to his concerns. Farina has always believed that Bitcoin maximalists are not ready to admit XRP’s superiority , and their blindness in this case reinforces his point. For him, the issue is the Bitcoin community’s refusal to confront the possibility of an unfavorable outcome. “Their fall will be the lesson,” he warned. “We tried to warn them.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-06T06:30:06,"DOGE Bulls Hold The Line At $0.15 — Is The Rally Still Alive?","Dogecoin (DOGE) prices have crashed by over 4% in the past month indicating a slightly dominant bearish influence in recent weeks. Similar to the crypto market leader (Bitcoin), the prominent altcoin and memecoin has registered significant market corrections since attaining a local peak of $0.249 on May 22. However, recent revelations by top analyst Ali Martinez has shown a bullish market condition that supports a price rebound for the DOGE market. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins DOGE Bulls Eye Return To $0.22 In an X post on July 5, Martinez provides some technical insights into the DOGE market highlighting an important requisite for the altcoin to rediscover its bullish form. Using the daily trading DOGEUSDT chart, the renowned analyst identifies an ascending trendline that stretches to 2023. At multiple instances of a retest, this trendline has acted as an efficient support consistently rejecting a further price decline. According to Martinez’s analysis, Dogecoin is trading around this trendline which presently runs through the $0.150 price level. The analyst explains market bulls must defend this price zone which not only fuels the chances of a price rebound, but essentially prevents a breakdown and complete transition to a bearish market. Interestingly, all retest of the highlighted trendline has always produced a price bounce resulting in a parabolic rally. This event is seen in price surges of $0.059 to $0.210 (≈255% gain) between 2023-2024, and $0.095 to $0.470 (≈395%) in 2024. However, Ali Martinez presents a conservative price target, stating a defence of $0.15 support level supports a quick bullish return to at least $0.220. Nevertheless, in the presence of a strong bullish pressure as seen in previous rallies, DOGE investors may expect a further rise to around $0.24 with a potential to return to the local market peak of $0.47. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.164 reflecting a modest price gain of 0.91% and 0.56% on the daily chart and weekly chart, respectively. Meanwhile, the memecoin has recorded a 56.81% crash in its daily trading volume indicating a significant fall in market interest. According to data from price prediction site Coincodex, general sentiment in the DOGE market is bearish. However, investors retain an healthy market demand as evidenced by a Fear & Greed Index of 67 i.e. significant amount of greed. For the short-term, Coincodex analysts expects DOGE to still maintain a price around $0.160 in the next five days while projecting a price gain to $0.193 in a month. Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts show little expected price growth in the far future as indicated by price targets of $0.197 in three months, and $0.169 in six months.

Currently, the price is consolidating just under a major resistance trendline on the daily chart. This level has held firm for several days, creating tension in the market as traders await the next decisive move. Interestingly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that back in 2020, a huge government spending bill helped send Bitcoin to record highs. Now in 2025, another spending bill is on the way, and this one is even bigger, hoping that history might repeat itself. In a recent interview, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared his outlook for Bitcoin’s price over the next two to three months. According to Moreno, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $87,000 and $99,000 in the short term if current market conditions continue. Moreno explained that this range is based on on-chain data showing the average price at which traders brought their Bitcoin, known as the realized price. In bull markets, prices often correct toward this level before moving higher again. The upper resistance band, which would act as a potential top for now, sits at $138,000. Right now, demand for Bitcoin appears to be weakening slightly. Unless buying activity picks up in the coming weeks, Moreno said there’s a stronger chance of seeing a dip toward $99,000 before any major rally. He said that in order to see Bitcoin climb to $138,000, demand would need to strengthen. Moreno further explained that Bitcoin’s market cycle top could still reach around $190,000 later on, though he expects the current cycle to stretch into 2026. Historically, Bitcoin performs well in the final quarter of the year during bull cycles, so a strong finish to 2025 isn’t off the table.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-could-test-99k-before-a-year-end-surge-say-market-experts/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|RESEARCH","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-07-06T05:00:44,"Ethereum Wyckoff Accumulation Hints At Explosive Q3 – $4K Level In Sight","Ethereum is trading just above the $2,500 mark following days of volatility, choppy price action, and uncertainty across crypto markets. Despite the hesitation, bulls have held critical support, and the coming days are shaping up to be a defining moment for Ethereum and the broader altcoin space. Momentum is slowly shifting as investors look for confirmation that ETH will lead the next wave of upside action. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that a Wyckoff accumulation pattern is currently unfolding. According to Pillows, this structure resembles the early stages of major breakouts seen in past cycles and signals strong smart money positioning. He argues that Ethereum already played a key role in Bitcoin’s latest rally to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to shine. A sustained breakout above the $2,600–$2,700 range could trigger the next phase of the cycle, with $3,000 in sight as the initial target. With market sentiment recovering and BTC consolidating near highs, traders and investors are closely watching Ethereum’s next move to gauge whether an altseason is around the corner. The setup is in place — but ETH must deliver. Ethereum Builds Strength Ethereum is up 82% from its April lows, demonstrating strong bullish control as the price holds firmly above key demand zones. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700, a structure that has persisted since early May. This tight consolidation suggests the market is preparing for a decisive breakout, one that could define Ethereum’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Ted Pillows reveals that Ethereum is now undergoing a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern. According to his analysis, this phase marks the transfer of ETH from weak hands to strong hands, and it mirrors past cycle setups that led to explosive rallies. Pillows argues that Ethereum helped push Bitcoin to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to take the spotlight. If this pattern plays out, Pillows sees a clear path: first a breakout to $3,000, followed by a healthy correction, and then a push to $4,000 sometime in Q3. Beyond that, the real parabolic move may begin, driven by renewed confidence, broader altcoin participation, and sustained demand for ETH as a core asset in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH Holds Above Key Support Amid Tight Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,520, maintaining its position above critical support levels despite recent volatility. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has acknowledged the $2,480–$2,500 zone multiple times since late May, signaling strong buyer interest at these levels. The price remains trapped within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, with no clear breakout yet in either direction. ETH is currently trading near its 50- and 100-period SMAs, which are converging around the current price, indicating equilibrium and a potential inflection point. The 200-period SMA sits below $2,200 and continues to trend upward, supporting the longer-term bullish structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range Volume has remained relatively stable, with no spike suggesting institutional accumulation or mass distribution. For bulls to regain full momentum, ETH must reclaim the $2,600–$2,700 resistance and flip it into support. On the downside, a clean break below $2,480 could expose the $2,300 zone once again.

As 2025 progresses, some projects are getting attention for their strong purpose, structured plans, and active communities. This article highlights four networks with different focuses, like mining systems, wallet utilities, Solana trading tools, and Bitcoin-based rewards. While each one has its unique approach, all share good upside potential during their current presale phases. Here are the top crypto presale projects in 2025 you should know about today, starting with BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG: GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Brings Special Pricing Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG’s presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11th. It has sold over 23.5 billion coins and raised $331.5 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The listing price is set at $0.05, opening the chance for over 3,000% returns when listed. There will be 45 batches or until it hits its $600 million funding target. This method builds strong infrastructure and market readiness before launch. BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG setup that supports fast processing with better energy efficiency. Its X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Hardware miners X30 and X100 will ship on July 7, and X10 on August 15. Security checks by CertiK and Halborn add to its credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing with real DeFi uses, an active system, and a six-week global plan, making it one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 with strong basics and early access advantages. BEST Wallet: A Multi-Use Wallet with Built-In Utility BEST Wallet offers a non-custodial wallet that works as a launchpad and staking platform. Its $BEST coin presale has raised over $13.5 million at a current price of $0.0252. From its 10 billion total coins, only 4.5% are in presale, spread across 100 small pricing stages. It offers swaps, bridges, staking, NFTs, and governance straight from its interface. Owning $BEST offers fee discounts, exclusive staking APYs above 105%, and access to future presales via the app. Security is boosted with Fireblocks MPC. Soon, NFT support and derivatives will launch. BEST Wallet is becoming a place for DeFi and presale activity, placing it among the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for those seeking wallet benefits and passive income options. Snorter: Telegram-Based Solana Trading Bot Snorter is built for Solana and gives fast, low-cost Telegram trading features. It combines sniping, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and copy-trading in one platform. Its standout feature is that it works directly within Telegram, letting users place trades quickly using simple chat commands. The presale is live, and pricing changes with demand via its portal. More than a bot, Snorter is building an entire system for the new Telegram trading era. As Solana bots grow, Snorter gives a timing and safety advantage. MEV protection and honeypot scanning help reduce risks often linked with fast sniping. This makes Snorter one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for users aiming to automate and improve their Solana trading strategies. BTC Bull: Coin Rewards Linked to Bitcoin Growth BTC Bull is a rewards coin that tracks Bitcoin’s market rise without needing to hold BTC itself. It uses custom smart contracts and DeFi staking layers to let users earn from BTC movements. The presale starts at around $0.001 with a burn system to keep the supply limited. Each presale stage has limited allocations to avoid sudden price drops. BTC Bull stands out for its rewards based on Bitcoin’s price. Users who stake early can earn higher APYs when BTC’s value goes up. Future plans include listings, BTC-pegged liquidity vaults, and rewards tied to Bitcoin dominance. With Bitcoin aiming beyond $60,000, BTC Bull gives a way to gain from this growth trend through structured incentives, making it a strong candidate in the top crypto presale projects in 2025 list. Final Remarks! BlockDAG offers an entry at just $0.0016 with early buyers seeing 2,660% gains so far, BEST Wallet combines wallet services with staking and launchpad utility, Snorter delivers Solana trading tools on Telegram, and BTC Bull lets users benefit from BTC price rises through its reward system. These top crypto presale projects in 2025 each bring their own features, from real usage to smart passive rewards. Picking the right one depends on your goals, but these projects are already building strong trust and practical use cases before their exchange listings.
