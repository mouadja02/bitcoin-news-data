With a massive $3.3 trillion U.S. spending bill freshly signed into law and Federal Reserve liquidity on the verge of turning positive for the first time in two years, the stage is being set for a potential parabolic rally in altcoins. This comes as Bitcoin dominance declines and altcoin charts flash strong breakout signals offering investors a rare opportunity to reposition before a potential parabolic rally. Repeat of 2020’s 600% Altcoin Surge? According to AltcoinGordon, the current market setup closely mirrors conditions from late 2020. Back then, a $1.4 trillion stimulus package preceded a 600% surge in the altcoin market.

2025-07-06T01:16:55,"Bitcoin volatility hits 20-month low as spot ETF inflows near $50B","Bitcoin is entering the second half of 2025 with significantly reduced volatility and on-chain activity, even as institutional interest intensifies. US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-06T01:00:13,"Analyst Who Predicted 600% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Says Next Leg Up Will Be ‘Parabolic’","A crypto analyst who previously forecasted a massive 600% XRP price surge in 2024 is once again drawing attention with a new technical analysis of the cryptocurrency. This time, the market expert says that XRP is getting ready for its next parabolic leg up. XRP Price Setup Signals Violent Upswing The latest XRP price analysis by market expert Crypto Michael indicates that the top altcoin has just concluded a significant period of consolidation and could be poised for an extremely explosive upward move. In his X post, the analyst shared a supporting chart, capturing XRP’s price action from 2017 to 2026, based on a long-term quarterly candlestick view. Over these years, XRP formed a large symmetrical triangle through a convergence of trendlines, illustrating a prolonged phase of price compression and market indecision. This chart pattern, extending from a peak in 2018 through to mid-2024, culminated in a decisive breakout in 2025. With Crypto Michael now considering XRP’s prolonged consolidation complete , technical indicators show a shift into a buildup phase ahead of the next major leg up . The analysis also highlights that this consolidation was necessary to accumulate buying pressure and position XRP for a shift out of its downtrend. Moving forward, the XRP price chart shows that the analyst expects a breakout from the symmetrical triangle soon. Once the cryptocurrency crosses the upper boundary of the triangle, a sustained move above key resistance levels could serve as a strong bullish signal. While the analyst has not explicitly outlined the exact target for his optimistic projection, the trajectory of his chart highlights that the XRP price, currently sitting at $2.22, is set to move upward. Analyst Sets Next XRP ATH Target Above $80 In other news, crypto analyst CW has dropped another incredibly bold forecast for the XRP price. The market expert presented a compelling multi-cycle chart, suggesting that XRP is in the final stages of a long-term consolidation and is now gathering momentum for a massive breakout . According to CW’s chart analysis, XRP has been in a six-month accumulation period, similar to patterns seen in previous markets. This steady accumulation phase appears to be forming a converging triangle, which historically is a precursor to major upward moves. Now at the cusp of a breakout, especially after testing the previous ATH region, the analyst suggests that XRP is finally stabilizing, interpreting this calm as a steady energy build-up for the next surge. If historical patterns hold, a surge beyond ATH prices could ignite a vertical rally. The chart identifies the first target at the previous ATH level above $3.8, followed by a second target around $21.5. The final target, representing phase 5 of the analysis, points to a parabolic surge beyond $80.

2025-07-06T00:30:52,"US Secret Service unmasks $400M crypto scam network","Over the past decade, the US Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has quietly recovered nearly $400 million in digital assets from cybercriminals, emerging as a formidable force in global crypto enforcement. What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

2025-07-05T23:30:39,"Here’s How High XRP Could Rise If Bitcoin Hits $1M","The possibility of Bitcoin reaching a $1 million valuation has gained considerable attention from industry leaders and financial analysts. As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Surpass This Estimate Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million? While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.

2025-07-05T23:00:14,"Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins","Bitcoin has held steady around the $108,000 price level in recent days. After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet” that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.” This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin’s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn’s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin’s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin’s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet’s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While Bitcoin and Solana thrive in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin positions it for remarkable growth in the surging altcoin market.

2025-07-05T22:00:13,"Analyst Reveals What Will Cause XRP Price Explosion","In a recent video shared on his X handle, prominent crypto analyst CryptoSensei outlined what he believes could trigger a massive price surge for XRP: the growing momentum behind XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As institutional interest in XRP gains traction across North America, the groundwork is being laid for what many believe could be the next big wave in crypto adoption, pending one breakthrough. XRP ETFs Gaining Ground in North America CryptoSensei highlighted that three major investment firms, Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, and 3iQ, have already secured regulatory approval for XRP ETFs in North America. Collectively, these firms manage over $32 billion in assets. Purpose Investments leads with $23 billion under management, followed by Evolve ETFs with $7 billion and 3iQ with $2 billion. While these approvals have primarily come from Canada, a jurisdiction known for its progressive stance on digital assets, they signal growing institutional confidence in XRP as a legitimate financial instrument. Canada has historically led the charge in crypto ETF approvals, having greenlit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs long before the U.S. followed suit. The approval of XRP ETFs there could be the first domino in a broader shift toward mainstream adoption. This will make #XRP explode… #Crypto pic.twitter.com/aO2v2DBAg4 — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) July 5, 2025 Institutional Demand Waiting on U.S. Clarity According to CryptoSensei, between 11 and 12 major U.S. institutions have filed for XRP ETFs . However, none have been approved, largely due to the ongoing legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple and its native token. The crux of the delay remains the SEC’s long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which alleges the company engaged in unregistered securities offerings through its XRP sales. Although Ripple scored a partial victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in itself, the case remains unresolved. Most recently, on June 26, 2025, Judge Torres rejected a proposed settlement agreement, leaving the legal status of XRP in limbo. Days later, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company would no longer pursue a counter-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop its appeal as well, effectively allowing the case to close. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 August Could Be the Turning Point CryptoSensei believes August could mark a decisive moment. “We will get an update on that in August. Please God, let this be finished and done in time,” he said, expressing the hope shared by many in the XRP community. A favorable conclusion to the case would remove the biggest barrier holding back U.S.-based XRP ETFs. With institutional demand already building and precedents set in neighboring markets, a final resolution in the Ripple case could ignite the long-anticipated XRP rally. If the SEC steps out of the way, ETF approvals could follow swiftly , positioning XRP for a significant price explosion fueled by mainstream investment flows. For now, all eyes are on August, as the crypto world waits to see whether XRP will finally be cleared for liftoff.

2025-07-05T21:30:34,"No Need To Panic, Bitcoin’s Peak Still Coming In October 2025 – Analyst","Bitcoin prices dipped by 0.93% in the last day after the premier cryptocurrency suffered another price rejection in the $110,000 range. This latest price pullback forces Bitcoin to maintain a consolidatory movement that has dominated the majority of last month drawing speculations about a potential market top. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on this discourse stating that historical data shows that Bitcoin is yet to achieve a peak price for the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Bitcoin’s Consolidation: A Preparation For Final Bull Leg In an X post on July 4, Ted Pillows shares a bullish market insight following another Bitcoin price dip. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency seemed on course to resume its market uptrend after a significant price rebound from $99,000 in late June following weeks of downward consolidatory movement. However, another decisive rejection in the $110,000 indicates Bitcoin’s prices remain range-bound thereby worsening investors’ concern across the market. In interpreting this situation, Pillows has called for calm stating the recent price dip is merely a “leverage flush” that requires no panic. Using a visual study on the BTC weekly chart, the renowned analyst shows that the current and previous price pullbacks are part of a predictable pattern that has played out across previous Bitcoin cycles. The chart shows that after each halving event, Bitcoin tends to peak approximately 18 months (518 days) later. With the most recent halving occurring in mid April 2024, the expected peak for this cycle would fall somewhere around Q4 2025, specifically on October 13, 2025, consistent with historical performance. Furthermore, a recurring 140-day rally window is also depicted in the chart, usually forming the final leg of the bull run. In each previous cycle, this 10-bar stretch delivered parabolic price movements. If history is rhyming once again, Bitcoin is now within range of initiating this 10-week bull run, suggesting the equivalent rally seen in previous could soon kick in. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’ How High Can Bitcoin Price Go? Based on Pillows’ recent analysis, Bitcoin may be gathering momentum for its final rally of the present market cycle. The extent of this anticipated uptrend remains unknown; however, the presence of bullish factors most notably the high influx of institutional investment and the US pro-crypto policies supports a range of sky scraping targets. For example, Pillows has previously shared that the popular stock-to-flow model which uses Bitcoin’s scarcity to project long-term price trajectory has predicted a potential price target of $368,925 by 2025 end. If this prediction holds true, Bitcoin investors are eyeing an estimated 242% from current market prices. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $108,299 reflecting a 0.83% gain in the past week.

2025-07-05T21:00:17,"Rumors: Bitcoin Early Adopters Are Selling Out to Buy XRP","A fresh wave of speculation is rippling through the crypto market following a viral X post by Edo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a long-time XRP advocate. According to Farina, some early Bitcoin adopters may be cashing out of their BTC holdings to accumulate XRP, marking what could be a major shift in sentiment among crypto’s earliest investors. A Strategic Rotation? Farina’s remarks draw attention to a potential change in the behavior of early BTC holders. He likened the current opportunity to buy XRP near the $2 mark to buying Bitcoin when it traded under $100, a historic moment that minted many of today’s crypto millionaires. The recent dip in XRP’s price below $2 and its quick correction may be a calculated trap to shake out weak hands, allowing savvy investors to accumulate. He went further, claiming that some veteran Bitcoin holders used this opportunity to exit BTC and rotate into XRP, betting on its long-term breakout potential. While this claim lacks concrete on-chain evidence, it has captured the attention of traders looking for signs of a broader market realignment. RUMORS: BTC EARLY ADOPTERS ARE SELLING OUT TO BUY $XRP . — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 The XRP Adoption Narrative Farina has long promoted XRP as a sleeping giant poised for mass adoption. In previous posts, he introduced the concept of the “XRP Adoption Candle,” suggesting a coming wave of institutional use, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF listings. In his view, XRP’s fundamentals, especially its use in real-world cross-border transactions, are becoming too compelling to ignore. He’s warned followers not to make the same mistake early Bitcoin holders did when they sold at $500, only to see BTC surge past $100,000. According to Farina, selling XRP at $10 or even $20 could one day look just as short-sighted . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism and Reality Check Despite Farina’s assertions, no verifiable on-chain data confirms a mass migration from BTC to XRP. While XRP wallet activity has surged up nearly 500% since 2022, analysts note that most of this growth has been retail-driven. Bitcoin, by contrast, remains the institutional heavyweight, still dominating capital inflows and long-term holding behavior. Farina’s claim that Bitcoin early adopters are reallocating into XRP may be more speculative than factual, for now. But it taps into a growing belief that XRP’s moment is near and that its current price level represents a historic buying opportunity. Whether the rumor proves true or not, it reflects a palpable shift in sentiment, one that could redefine the next phase of crypto market leadership.

2025-07-05T21:00:00,"Bitcoin exposure or fiat disguise? Treasury firms divide the crypto community","Bitcoin treasury companies — entities that accumulate the digital asset (usually through borrowed assets) — offer clients indirect exposure through their stock. Some believe that these companies bring Bitcoin to Wall Street. Others think that these treasury companies are doing the opposite: turning bitcoiners into so-called “fiat bros.” From self-custody of private keys to indirect Bitcoin ‘exposure’ In 2021, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk famously replied “Your app sucks” to a crypto wallet that didn’t support user access to their private keys. Now, when Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies get so much attention, it may seem that self-custody has silently left the scene. Although the big narrative is occupied with the news about treasury companies spending millions of dollars (of borrowed money) to buy as many bitcoins as possible, bitcoiners who (at best) don’t care about “indirect exposure to Bitcoin” didn’t go anywhere. They are just not as visible on social and mass media. Indirect Bitcoin exposure, or owning paper Bitcoin, is owning certain assets issued by the company that strategically accumulate Bitcoin on its balance sheets. Stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies (for instance, MSTR by Strategy) or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of asset management companies holding Bitcoin (for example, IBIT by BlackRock) are two of the most popular types of assets that expose users to Bitcoin. It is assumed that owning these assets allows holders to benefit from the price movements of Bitcoin as they are reflected in the value of these assets. That’s why Bitcoin ETFs, stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies, Bitcoin derivatives, and similar assets are considered to be holding Bitcoin, although it’s essentially paper Bitcoin. Read more: How we went from Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin Are treasury companies Trojan-horsing Wall Street? Some view treasury companies as a straightforward means for institutional and corporate investors to enter the crypto market. Indeed, for companies, buying stocks of Strategy is easier than buying Bitcoin in terms of the law. Strategy is holding nearly 600,000 bitcoins, and engaging in such a regular activity as buying MSTR stocks exposes corporate buyers to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. As treasury companies continue to accumulate bitcoins relentlessly, they increase buying pressure, which prevents the BTC price from experiencing significant drops. Corporations buying stocks of treasury companies indirectly invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury companies short fiat money and buy bitcoin. Greatest business model in human history. — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) July 1, 2025 Michael Saylor, the Chairman of Strategy, said he wants to bridge the cryptocurrency economy and traditional capital markets. Some view him and other treasury companies as a Trojan horse that takes Bitcoin to Wall Street. However, some see the opposite happening – treasury companies are turning bitcoiners into traditional finance investors. Treasury companies’ critics stress that, despite much talk about Bitcoin, these companies are operating in the conventional finance sector and promoting their stocks to both TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto investors. Who’s Trojan Horsing Who? @americanhodl8 deserves an Oscar for this Bitcoin masterpiece 🔥 pic.twitter.com/mek5h12RMo — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) June 30, 2025 Notably, these companies don’t pay their employees in crypto, nor do they accept Bitcoin as a payment method for their stocks, among other things. Literally, these companies don’t offer any kind of Bitcoin experience to their clients and employees. For the TradFi sector, treasury companies serve as a way to profit from Bitcoin’s value growth. However, for Bitcoin investors, these companies may appear to be a TradFi agent’s invasion that seduces people to stop buying and holding bitcoins and switch to a traditional instrument like stocks. The Bitcoin standard narrative allegedly only serves as a promotion tool for the audience of Bitcoin enthusiasts. https://t.co/RASOc9PsWg — Satoshi’s Journal (@SatoshisJournal) November 10, 2024 While there is nothing wrong with competing for investors, it seems that bitcoiners are angered by the fact that treasury companies have infected most of the Bitcoin-related media with promotional posts about them. Self-custody advocates argue that Bitcoin podcasters, Crypto X, crypto conferences–all these platforms are “shilling” Strategy and Nakamoto stocks. As a result, it leaves too little space for conversation with those who share similar values, such as independence and a self-custody philosophy. ""Every podcaster who is not a treasury company executive is a policy failure. We must seize the means of paper bitcoin production"" Wow! (pic unrelated) pic.twitter.com/6142sYrBFy — Andrew M. Bailey (@resistancemoney) July 3, 2025 Another concern associated with treasury companies is that their strategies may not be so safe, and at some point, they will have to sell the bitcoins they buy. It may trigger a domino effect that could bury even giants like Strategy. According to a recent report from venture capital company Breed, most Bitcoin treasury companies are unlikely to survive a “death spiral” that may be triggered by a sudden drop in the BTC price. The chances of the companies resurrecting after the crash are thinner, especially given their centralized nature.

Source: Finbold For the price outlook, analysis by TradingShot , in a TradingView post on July 5, highlighted that Bitcoin is flashing a strong bullish signal after completing a golden cross on the four-hour chart. The cryptocurrency is now holding above its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ), a key support level that, if maintained, could fuel a sharp rally. According to TradingShot, the current setup mirrors Bitcoin’s April–May rally, when a similar channel up pattern peaked near the 2.618 Fibonacci extension . The fractal shows the same series of lower highs, eventually broken by a strong upward move. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

If the pattern holds, TradingShot projects BTC could reach $130,000 by early August, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch On the other hand, analysis by Ali Martinez in an X post on July 5 identified key price levels to watch. He noted that investors should keep an eye on $106,738 and $98,566. This is based on the latest In/Out of the Money Around Price analysis, which shows strong buyer interest concentrated in these two ranges, where significant numbers of addresses previously accumulated BTC.

Below that, another cluster of 1.71 million addresses is positioned near $98,566, providing additional support. On-chain data shows 89.36% of BTC holders are still “in the money,” highlighting resilience despite volatility, while just 10.36% are underwater. If Bitcoin falls further, two key demand zones could help cushion the downside and spark a rebound.

2025-07-05T20:00:51,"Three Strong Reasons to Buy XRP Before End of Summer","XRP has seen modest performance so far in 2025, with only a 5% gain in the first six months of the year. However, there are clear signs that the remainder of the year could present much stronger momentum for the cryptocurrency. Several key developments are on the horizon, which may justify taking a position in XRP before the end of summer. This article examines three major factors that could drive demand: regulatory clarity, the emergence of XRP-focused treasury strategies, and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Regulatory clarity approaching The long-standing legal uncertainty surrounding XRP is close to resolution. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, has indicated since March that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was preparing to drop its case against it. In June, Ripple further stated it planned to withdraw any future appeals, while the SEC similarly suggested it would cease pursuing additional appeals. Although final paperwork remains outstanding, the case is expected to conclude by the end of July. Beyond the lawsuit, significant legislative efforts are progressing in Congress to create a more structured regulatory environment for digital assets. Two proposed laws — the Genius Act and the Clarity Act — are considered particularly relevant to XRP. The Genius Act sets out rules for stablecoins, a segment where the XRP blockchain could see new growth. Meanwhile, the Clarity Act would establish a regulatory framework for all digital assets. It could remove barriers for institutional investors wary of compliance risks. Both bills are projected to reach President Donald Trump’s desk for signature before Congress recesses in August, creating an environment of regulatory certainty that could benefit XRP’s adoption and value . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Treasury Companies Gaining Traction Another trend worth noting is the rise of companies adding XRP to their corporate treasuries. In June, VivoPower International announced plans to acquire $120 million worth of XRP for its balance sheet, marking the first such move of its kind. Soon after, Trident Digital Tech Holdings revealed it would allocate $500 million in XRP. These decisions echo the approach taken by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which amassed a significant Bitcoin position over the past five years, now valued at $65 billion. Although current XRP treasury initiatives are limited to smaller companies, there is growing anticipation that a larger firm may follow suit in the coming months. Analysts have suggested the possibility of a “MicroStrategy of XRP” emerging before the end of summer, which could further validate and elevate the asset in corporate finance circles. Spot XRP ETFs under review Perhaps the most anticipated development is the SEC’s pending decision on spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg estimates a 95% likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF this year. The deadline for a final decision is mid-October. However, approval could come earlier. The recent SEC approval of a Grayscale fund holding XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggests momentum is building toward acceptance of dedicated spot XRP ETFs. If approved, spot ETFs would allow institutional capital to flow into XRP more easily, particularly once regulatory legislation is finalized. Industry observers have noted that such developments would signal that “it’s OK to invest in XRP,” removing legal and compliance concerns that previously restrained investment from larger entities. Looking Beyond Summer Investors should remain mindful of potential risks despite these positive catalysts. XRP has fallen short of expectations before, and if any of these developments fail to materialize, its price may stagnate or grow only modestly. However, if the three catalysts align as anticipated, there is optimism that XRP could retest its historical highs and strengthen its position in the market before year-end. Given the current trajectory and the convergence of these factors, summer 2025 appears to offer a unique opportunity for those considering entering or expanding their positions in XRP.

2025-07-05T20:00:23,"Scammers Drain $70,000 From Bank Accounts in Scheme Targeting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Capital One Customers: Report","An ATM scheme has reportedly drained tens of thousands of dollars from elderly customers of the biggest banks in the United States. New York City police are warning senior citizens to be on the lookout for a trio of scammers at ATMs after a crime spree that occurred between May and June, reports The New York Post. Authorities warn that the group – made up of two men and a woman – act as good Samaritans by offering to help the elderly use the ATM or strike up a conversation with them as a distraction to try and steal their bank cards. Police say that on May 14th, the trio stole $20,000 from the bank account of a 90-year-old woman and drained $3,000 from the account of an 83-year-old woman in two separate incidents that occurred just one hour apart. On June 2nd, one of the thieves started up a conversation with a 71-year-old man while withdrawing cash at a Chase Bank ATM. While the victim was distracted, the scammer stole the man’s bank card and linked up with another man at a different Chase Bank ATM location, where they tried to take out $5,500. The 71-year-old says the scammers charged $6,000 to his account in just one hour. The thieves struck again on June 19th when they targeted an 86-year-old woman and stole about $24,000 from her account. According to the police, the trio is responsible for stealing at least $70,000 from elderly victims. Authorities say that a total of nine incidents of thieves using the same scheme against seniors at Chase Bank, Bank of America, Capital One and Citibank locations in New York were reported between May 8th and June 26th.

2025-07-05T20:00:14,"Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack?","In a recent X post, CryptoWzrd highlighted that Litecoin (LTC) closed the day on a slightly bearish note. He explained that LTC’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin’s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC’s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today’s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be ‘Just Weeks Away’ From Third-Ever Golden Cross — Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action.

2025-07-05T19:30:15,"Bitcoin Primed To Hit New All-Time High Soon Enough, According to Fidelity’s Global Macro Analyst Jurrien Timmer – Here’s Why","Fidelity Investments’ global macro director Jurrien Timmer says that the stage is set for Bitcoin ( BTC ) to have an explosive breakout. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that based on a historical relationship between Bitcoin and the global money supply metric the top digital asset by soon print new all-time highs. “With both liquidity improving per the global money supply and the stock market reaching new highs, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin is on the move again. Both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are being supported for now, and Bitcoin should be at new all-time highs soon enough if this momentum continues.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Timmer also says that a weakening US dollar may drive more investors into gold and, potentially, Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. “One of the big questions remains whether a new world order is emerging in which the US dollar loses at least some of its supremacy and is supplanted by a mixture of other fiat currencies and hard money (gold and perhaps Bitcoin). Maybe this regime change was signaled three years ago when gold stopped trading in lockstep with real rates.” Lastly, the analyst says the Sharpe ratio is now starting to favor BTC over gold as a better return on investment. The ratio was created by Nobel laureate William Sharpe and is designed to show the amount of return an investor could potentially get for enduring the volatility of a risky asset. “With risk appetites rising, the baton has been passed back to Bitcoin, following the pattern of recent months. You can see that in the chart below, with the two Sharpe ratios converging.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,792 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-05T19:29:12,"Robert Kiyosaki Embraces Bitcoin Crash Fears as Buying Opportunity","As warnings about a possible Bitcoin (BTC) crash gain attention, many investors are growing nervous. However, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, sees things differently. Rather than panic, he welcomes the idea of a price drop. Kiyosaki believes that a crash would be a perfect moment to increase his Bitcoin holdings, turning fear into opportunity. A Clear Strategy Behind the Bold Message In a recent X post , Kiyosaki strongly reacted to the ongoing noise surrounding a potential Bitcoin crash. He criticized those spreading fear, claiming that they aim to scare off short-term investors. For him, falling prices are not a problem but an invitation to buy more. Kiyosaki’s approach is not new. He has long seen Bitcoin as a haven against inflation and the weakening of traditional currencies. While others worry about temporary dips, he remains focused on the coin’s long-term value. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,062, up by 0.53% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. Robert Kiyosaki hopes the crypto prices drop so he can add more of it to his portfolio. This mindset follows his earlier declaration that he plans to buy more Bitcoin before it reaches a major milestone. He has shared his belief that Bitcoin could climb to $1 million within the next ten years. For Kiyosaki, the market volatility or fear of a downturn does not affect his future expectations. Support from the Bitcoin Community Kiyosaki is not alone in his belief. He referred to fellow Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who recently predicted much higher future prices. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $13 million in the next ten years. He thinks the digital coin might even hit $21 million by the mid-2040s, matching its total supply of 21 million coins. These bold predictions make Kiyosaki even more confident in Bitcoin. He says Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply are big reasons why it will grow in value over time. Robert Kiyosaki Looks to Bitcoin as the Dollar Loses Strength Robert Kiyosaki’s support for Bitcoin is closely linked to his concerns about traditional paper money, especially the US dollar. Over the years, he has often said that the dollar is losing value. He believes this is because central banks continue to print more money, especially during times of economic crisis. This leads to higher inflation, which makes everyday goods more expensive and savings less valuable. As a result, Kiyosaki views Bitcoin as a more effective way to protect one’s money. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply, it can maintain its value more effectively over time. He also believes that future economic problems will exacerbate the issues with fiat money, which is why he continues to invest in the top cryptocurrency.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

In a new press release , the Fed is prohibiting former Jonah Bank employee Kendall Hickman from participating in activities related to financial institutions after she was allegedly found to have embezzled $33,212 from a nonprofit organization. According to the Fed, Hickman worked for both the Wyoming-based bank as well as moonlighted for an unnamed nonprofit organization as a bookkeeper. She worked for both firms from July 2021 to June 2023, and through unexplained means, she managed to embezzle the funds from the nonprofit, but was allegedly caught by authorities. The Fed says Hickman’s actions “constituted violations of law or regulation and involved personal dishonesty.” Though she has repaid the nonprofit in full and has consented to the enforcement actions against her, she has neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations. The prohibition order notes that taking this enforcement action doesn’t bar it from taking further actions against Hickman later on. If Hickman were to violate this order, she would be charged with separate civil or criminal penalties, according to the press release. Jonah Bank, the nation’s 1,474th-largest bank, has $529 million worth of assets under its management and was established in 2006.

The speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams, says the most populous US city is allocating $3 million to a guaranteed income program. The program will “provide direct cash grants to expecting mothers and foster youth facing housing insecurity.” Mayor Eric Adams hailed New York City Council’s $115.9 billion budget, which was agreed upon in late June, as the “Best Budget Ever.” While information was scant on how the New York City guaranteed income program will be rolled out, how long it will run, how many participants will be selected and other key details, this is not the first time the Big Apple is allocating funds to such an initiative. In the 2025 financial year, the New York City Council allocated $1.5 million to support a guaranteed income pilot program designed to assist “expectant mothers to improve maternal health and reduce child poverty.” This was the first time municipal funds had been used in a guaranteed income program. To run the program, the city partnered with The Bridge Project, a nonprofit focused on helping low-income expectant mothers. A total of 161 pregnant women experiencing housing insecurity who were selected to participate in The Bridge Project initiative will receive regular income with no strings attached for the first three years of their children’s lives.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $108,000, lower than this week’s high of $110,000, and 10% above the lowest point this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their strong performance this week, with their cumulative inflows soaring by $769 million. That’s down from $2.2 billion the previous week. The weekly decline is partially due to the fact that this week had four U.S. trading days, in observance of Independence Day — a federal holiday in the United States. These ETFs have experienced cumulative inflows of $49 billion, indicating that they may surpass the $50 billion mark next week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, whose ticker is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $52.6 billion. IBIT now holds over $76.5 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest ETFs in the United States. It ranks in eighth position among all BlackRock ETFs as it recently passed the iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Observers note that the fund is likely to reach the $80 billion milestone soon. IBIT has been the fastest-growing ETF ever and is continuing to close the gap with the SPDR Gold Trust, which has $101 billion in assets. GLD was established in 2004.

This puts it just behind two of BlackRock’s largest ETFs, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. However, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF is very close to outpacing these crypto funds in revenue. It is only $20 million behind the top fund and $16 million behind the second. The crypto fund needs just $9 billion more in assets to become the company’s top revenue-generating ETF. If the strong market interest continues, IBIT could reach that goal soon. More people are seeking easy ways to invest in digital assets, which could help the crypto investment fund rise even higher in the rankings. IBIT Named the Fastest-Growing ETF in History IBIT is growing faster than any other ETF ever . It has attracted a significant inflow of investors in a short time, surpassing the inflow of most ETFs in the market. It reached $2 billion in inflows just days after launching. Within six months, it crossed $50 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This growth came from steady investments by hedge funds, companies, and financial advisors. This is happening because more people and companies are adding Bitcoin (BTC) into their balance sheet. A Sign of Growing Trust in Bitcoin One reason IBIT is doing well is that it makes buying Bitcoin simple. Investors do not need to open special crypto wallets or worry about how to keep their digital assets safe. With IBIT, they can invest in Bitcoin through a trusted and regulated fund. This makes it easier and safer for many to get involved with the top digital coin. BlackRock says IBIT’s growth demonstrates that more professional investors are now trusting Bitcoin. The way IBIT is growing is like how gold ETFs grew when they first started. This indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to be viewed as a conventional investment , alongside stocks or gold. As a result, the leading crypto asset is becoming a more accepted part of regular investment plans.
