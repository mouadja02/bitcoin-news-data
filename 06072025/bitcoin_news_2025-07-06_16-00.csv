In a new press release , the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says that 41-year-old Ehis Lawrence Akhimie has pleaded guilty to operating a transnational inheritance fraud scheme that defrauded over $6 million from more than 400 victims over the course of several years. Authorities say that Akhimie and his co-conspirators sent letters to their victims in the US falsely claiming they were representatives of a bank in Spain. The scammers told the recipients that their relative had died in another country and left them with a multi-million-dollar inheritance. The bad actors also told their victims that if they wanted to receive the inheritance, they would need to pay delivery fees, taxes and other bills to avoid any friction with the government. The scammers then raked in the money and never followed through on any promise. Akhimie faces 20 years behind bars after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. As stated by Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, “The Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch will continue to pursue, prosecute and bring to justice transnational criminals responsible for defrauding US consumers, wherever they are located.

2025-07-06T13:24:32,"Bitcoin whale moves $8.6 billion in BTC, likely for address upgrade, not selling","According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the Bitcoin whale who recently moved $8.6 billion in BTC for the first time in over 14 years likely has no intention to sell. The firm believes the whale transferred their assets for an address upgrade. In an X post , the firm said , “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses. There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin.” Whale transferred assets due to transition to a Native SegWit address Arkham had earlier revealed that a BTC whale executed eight transfers to relocate roughly 80,000 BTC purchased years ago for just $0.78 to $3.37 per coin. However, within the first few hours of the transfer, speculation swirled about potential sell-offs and a looming crypto market crash. Crypto community members questioned the trader’s intentions, leading to a brief period of Bitcoin price consolidation. While some interpreted the transfer as a calculated effort to take advantage of Bitcoin nearing its all-time high, others viewed it as a potential ploy to sow FUD in the market before pumping their prices for greater returns. Some also believed that the trader needed to update their cold storage solution, and others went as far as to associate the move with the government. Arkham, however, suggests the eight transfers were made as a technical move to transition from a legacy wallet to a more secure and fee-efficient Native SegWit address. The firm claimed there were no signs that the whale intends to sell the assets. Nevertheless, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that although there’s no indication that the tokens are being readied for sale, the past few months have shown early holders slowly selling into ETF and corporate treasury demand. For instance, in February, Bitcoiner PlanB disclosed that he had converted all of his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs. He argued that not dealing with keys anymore is much easier, adding, “I guess I am not a maxi anymore.” Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggests wallet compromise The Bitcoin transfer also drew the attention of major crypto players, some weighing in on the possible cause or just giving their general opinion on the matter. For starters, Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, suggested that the $8.6 billion transfer might result from a hack, warning that if confirmed, it could represent the largest theft in crypto history. He further argued that before the assets were moved, a single BCH test transaction was done, possibly indicating that the actor was testing the private key discreetly, as BCH tends to attract less attention from whale-tracking services. On the other hand, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stated that he “got into crypto too late,” citing how 14 years ago most whales bought their BTC for roughly $0.1. Some analysts hinted that Roger Ver could be the whale responsible for the transfer. They believe he made similar Bitcoin purchases in 2011 and recently bailed out of a Spanish prison on June 5. However, nothing about the whale’s identity has been confirmed.

2025-07-06T13:15:00,"Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200M in RWAs on XRP Ledger, Ripple Reveals","Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest crypto exchanges, announced plans to tokenize $200 million worth of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger. Key Takeaways: Mercado Bitcoin will tokenize $200M in fixed-income and equity assets on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s move comes amid forecasts of a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033. Calls for clear U.S. tokenization rules are growing as major players push into RWAs. The move will bring tokenized fixed-income and equity instruments onto XRPL, as the exchange looks to tap into the growing market for digital versions of traditional assets, according to a statement released by Ripple on Friday . “Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” said Silvio Pegado, Managing Director, LATAM at Ripple. Push for Tokenization Rules Gains Steam in US Market Ripple’s announcement follows a Boston Consulting Group report forecasting the tokenized RWA sector to reach a market capitalization of $19 trillion by 2033, underscoring surging interest from both crypto-native and traditional financial players. The deal highlights momentum across the industry as asset managers and blockchain firms ramp up efforts to secure regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets, especially in the United States. Earlier this week, Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance protocol, acquired Oasis Pro , a regulated trading platform specializing in digital securities settlements, to deepen its footprint in the RWA market. Meanwhile, Centrifuge, another blockchain firm focused on real-world assets, unveiled plans to tokenize the S&P 500 index, offering decentralized access to a basket of America’s top publicly listed companies. WOW! THIS IS BULLISH FOR $XRP Mercado Bitcoin is unlocking $200M+ of real-world assets on XRP Ledger No hype, just regulated yield on-chain This is LATAM’s biggest tokenization wave, and it won’t stop there When $19T goes digital, will you still be on the sidelines? pic.twitter.com/QwGoRtTBeK — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 5, 2025 The rush into tokenized RWAs has also attracted attention from the biggest names in finance. In January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink publicly called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds , arguing it could improve market efficiency. Last week, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins told CNBC that the “rules have not been clear” when it comes to regulating digital assets in the United States and hinted at the “imminent” boom in tokenization as a whole. Atkins claimed that tokenization is “the next step” in order to have “much more efficiency” across markets. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against SEC to Resolve Case Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company will withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal. The announcement followed a U.S. district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. In her ruling, Judge Analisa Torres noted Ripple’s readiness to “push the boundaries” of the earlier summary judgment, suggesting a risk of future violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the firm faced a choice between dropping the appeal or continuing to contest the finding. He emphasized that regardless of the decision, “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” and assured that Ripple’s business operations would continue as usual.

2025-07-06T13:00:00,"Chart of the Week: Wall Street Has Claimed Bitcoin—Now What?","""Wall Street is coming for bitcoin."" That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general)—an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. A major example in BTC’s history that’s not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis. The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe’s debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut. In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin’s response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold. After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox , the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity. That changed everything. The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility . But let’s face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset. ""Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,"" said NYDIC Research in a report. In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. ""Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range."" Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is), bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold. Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. NYDIG notes that bitcoin’s correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now. Risk asset So why the shift? The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with ""safe haven."" Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included. ""This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,"" said NYDIG. And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities. ""The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,"" NYDIG's report said. For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker.

While asset management companies’ increasing optimism about US stocks is drawing attention, there are warnings that this excitement could lead to overly concentrated positions and cause sharp fluctuations, especially in the event of a negative development. The most important of these risks is Donald Trump’s customs tax review process, which will end on July 9.

In an X post on Friday, Arkham stated , “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” providing reassurance to market participants closely watching the transaction. The transfer involved 10,000 Bitcoin at a time from eight wallets that had remained untouched since 2011, sparking curiosity across the crypto community. Arkham noted that the activity may have been driven by a technical reason, suggesting the Bitcoin owner could be upgrading from legacy wallets to Native SegWit addresses for enhanced security and lower transaction fees. Wallet Upgrade May Explain Whale Activity: Arkham “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham explained. The firm detailed that the Bitcoin was originally deposited into these wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and remained dormant for over 14 years before being moved to eight new wallets, where the funds have since stayed. While there is no evidence suggesting an imminent market impact, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that its analysis has long indicated early Bitcoin holders may gradually offload their holdings to meet the demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries. However, it remains unclear if the current transfers are part of such activity. The event also drew commentary from prominent industry figures. PlanB, a well-known Bitcoiner, recently revealed in February that he converted all his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing convenience and peace of mind. Speculation and Reactions from Industry Leaders While most interpretations of the whale transfer remain technical, Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, floated a cautious note, stating there is a slim possibility the massive movement could have resulted from a hack . “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan commented. The unusual transfer caught the attention of former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who took a lighthearted approach, stating, “I got into crypto too late,” after observing the 2011 Bitcoin whales moving coins they obtained for around $0.10 each. Despite the intrigue, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable , reflecting market confidence that the movement of these dormant funds is not an immediate threat to the current trading environment.

2025-07-06T12:30:12,"Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown","Bitcoin is currently holding just above the $108,000 level and bulls are maintaining momentum after a volatile start to July. However, a closer look at on-chain data shows how fragile that position might be. Interestingly, two support levels, $106,738 and $98,566, are now the most important zones for bulls to defend. These levels represent clusters of addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin, and losing them could trigger a deeper correction. Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ Bitcoin’s Support Clusters Around $106,000 And $98,000 Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to two major support levels based on data showing Bitcoin’s purchase clusters. This data is based on Sentora’s (previously IntoTheBlock) In/Out of the Money Around Price metric among addresses that bought Bitcoin close to the current price. As shown by the metric, the most important current zones of purchase are at $106,738 and $98,566. These two zones are where massive buying activity has occurred in the past few weeks, and they could act as support in case of a Bitcoin price crash. The first zone, between $104,982 and $108,190, contains 1.68 million addresses with a total volume of 1.28 million BTC at an average price of $106,738. Below the first zone, a larger group of 1.71 million addresses holds a greater volume of 1.25 million BTC within the price range of $95,248 to $98,566, with an average price of $98,566. As long as Bitcoin continues to trade above these levels, the ongoing rally could continue to push upward. However, if these pockets of demand are broken with enough selling pressure, the leading cryptocurrency could enter into an uncertain price zone with little buying interest to provide support. Speaking of selling pressure, on-chain data shows a slowing sell pressure among large holders. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, Bitcoin recorded its fifth straight week of net outflows from centralized exchanges. The past week alone saw more than $920 million worth of BTC moved into self-custody or institutional products, mostly Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Needs To Break Weekly Resistance For New Highs Even with solid demand zones beneath, Bitcoin’s path to new highs is not yet confirmed. Analyst Rekt Capital weighed in with his analysis, noting that Bitcoin is currently facing a strong weekly resistance band just under $109,000. Particularly, Bitcoin is at risk of a lower high structure on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Rekt Capital noted that a weekly close above the red horizontal resistance line must be achieved in order for Bitcoin to reclaim a more bullish stance. That resistance, which is currently around $108,890, is acting as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s upward rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest As such, Bitcoin would need to make a weekly close above $108,890 to position itself for new all-time highs. Unless there is a convincing break of that level, the price action of Bitcoin could be erratic and susceptible to a retracement to $106,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,160.

2025-07-06T12:25:00,"Summer’s top crypto picks: BTC is too expensive, but this $0.03 token might 10x","For most retail investors, buying into Bitcoin (BTC) at over $108,000 isn’t practical anymore. The upside might still be there, but getting meaningful returns requires capital that’s out of reach for the average trader. That’s why attention is rapidly shifting toward early-stage tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.03. It’s a strategic entry point for those looking to turn modest capital into something far more significant—just as early Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum investors once did. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into Phase 5 of its presale, having already raised over $11.7 million from more than 12,700 individual wallets. Over 60% of the tokens allocated for this round have been snapped up. What makes this project stand out is not just its low entry price, but the layered financial utility built into its ecosystem—especially through its mtTokens. One trader who moved $3,500 from Bitcoin (BTC) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) last month now holds over $5,400 in unrealized gains. That kind of growth, in just weeks, shows why smart capital is now rotating from high-cap legacy coins into more targeted, function-driven DeFi protocols. mtTokens deliver passive yield while expanding liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has engineered a unique mechanism to support long-term investor gains through mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens issued when users deposit assets into the protocol’s peer-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. These tokens are designed to grow in value automatically as interest accrues. There’s no need to claim rewards or actively reinvest; the mtTokens themselves reflect both the principal and the interest. What separates this system from standard yield platforms is the dual-layered benefit. First, users who deposit stable assets like USDT or top-tier coins like ETH or BTC are issued mtTokens on a 1:1 basis. Over time, these tokens increase in value as lending activity rises. Second, those same mtTokens can be staked in smart contracts to earn a share of the protocol’s revenue, which is used to buy back and distribute MUTM tokens to mtToken stakers. This creates a powerful flywheel effect. More users enter the system to earn yield. That demand drives up borrowing volume, which boosts protocol revenue. The system then recycles that income to reward long-term holders, applying buying pressure to MUTM and incentivizing staking. This structure is what separates utility tokens from hype coins—and why large holders are entering early with confidence. Stablecoin architecture unlocks additional value layers While many projects launch without foundational utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized, crypto-backed stablecoin system. This stablecoin will only be minted when users post approved collateral like ETH, and it will be burned as soon as loans are repaid or liquidated. Only verified issuers will be able to mint the coin, each with a strict cap to prevent excessive risk. The protocol will adjust interest rates dynamically to keep the stablecoin close to its $1 peg. If the price rises above $1, rates will drop. If it falls below, rates will climb. Arbitrage incentives will further reinforce stability, ensuring the asset maintains its target price. The introduction of this stablecoin will not only enhance user functionality but also support broader treasury utility across the platform. Mutuum’s approach offers direct benefits to those who understand the value of structured lending and borrowing. For example, users who deposit $15,000 in DAI will receive mtDAI, which compounds as interest builds over time. If pool utilization drives the APY to around 10%, that user would earn $1,500 over a year without moving their position. And since mtTokens can be staked for extra dividends, yield potential multiplies without added complexity. With over 4 billion MUTM tokens in total supply and a Phase 11 listing price set at $0.06, the upside from today’s $0.03 level is already tangible. Investors entering now double their position value right at the exchange listing. And with real protocol usage on the horizon—including a beta platform release alongside token launch—the stage is set for accelerated growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not aiming to be just another DeFi token—it’s building a complete infrastructure. With CertiK audit backing, a $50,000 bug bounty in place, and Layer-2 integration under development, the foundations are in motion to support serious on-chain activity. When SHIB moved from $0.000001 to $0.00008, most ignored it early. When BNB was $0.10, few thought it was worth the risk. Now, with Bitcoin (BTC) priced out of reach for most, investors are hunting for the next asymmetric bet. At just $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be that bet.

The recent momentum follows heightened speculation from technical analyst Crypto Michael, who highlighted XRP’s long-term consolidation phase.

XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Since then, XRP has been range-bound for seven months in what Michael describes as “healthy consolidation.” The chart identifies this post-rally phase as critical, with a white-circled zone indicating that prices are stabilising just above key resistance levels. Michael argues this consolidation phase is nearing completion. Importantly, XRP’s technical stability is unfolding while Bitcoin hovers near its own historic resistance—an 8-year trendline. Michael suggests that Bitcoin’s move above this line could serve as the macro trigger that lifts altcoins, such as XRP, into a fresh leg higher. XRP Technical Signals Hint at Bullish Breakout On the 4-hour chart, the XRP price prediction appears bullish, as XRP has reclaimed the $2.2175 level, now acting as short-term support. Price is also riding along a well-defined ascending trendline from late June, creating a pattern of higher lows. This bullish structure is reinforced by a recent bullish engulfing candle and rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now approaches the 60 mark but remains below overbought levels. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-SMA currently sits at $2.2175 and has been reclaimed, a positive signal for trend continuation. XRP is also reclaiming the mid-range of its prior swing, positioning it well for a breakout above $2.285. Key technical takeaways: XRP/USD trades bullish above 50-SMA and ascending trendline RSI is rising, indicating growing bullish momentum Resistance at $2.285, followed by $2.337 and $2.406 Support levels: $2.2175, $2.146, and $2.080 If XRP holds above $2.2175 and gains traction beyond $2.285, traders could see a push toward the $2.40–$2.47 range. XRP Trade Setup: Breakout Retest in Focus This setup favours breakout traders looking for confirmation and continuation. As XRP approaches $2.285 resistance, volume and candle structure will be key. Entry (Long): $2.27–$2.29 on strong breakout close Targets: $2.337 to $2.406 Stop-Loss: Below $2.21 to manage downside With RSI rising, price above trendline support, and consolidation nearing its end, XRP appears well-positioned for a decisive move—especially if Bitcoin breaks its own resistance in tandem.

2025-07-06T12:01:39,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Independence Day Weekend Sees BTC Hold Steady Around $108,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, hovering around the $108,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,498 but quickly lost momentum after sellers overwhelmed buyers at higher levels. As a result, the price briefly fell below $108,000 before consolidating around current levels. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return next week and BTC could retest the $110,000-$111,000 levels. Taxing Bitcoin Does Not Make Sense: Miller Value Partners Miller Value Partners' Chief Investment Officer, Bill Miller IV, believes the government has no right to tax Bitcoin because managing ownership rights does not require administrative efforts. Miller, known for his early advocacy of Bitcoin , stated that the flagship cryptocurrency does not require government infrastructure to verify or enforce property rights, unlike traditional assets such as real estate. Miller stated during a podcast, “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense. When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what. The reality is that if you think about why you pay taxes in society, it is to enforce property rights.” He added, “The government didn’t create Bitcoin, so that is an important point to keep in mind. The blockchain does that property automation for itself, right?” Miller also believes traditional asset managers face hurdles when buying Bitcoin due to the uncertainty around taxation. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out.” New Bitcoin Treasury Firms Could Struggle A crypto analyst has sounded an alarm over the Bitcoin treasury strategy, stating that newer firms could face significant challenges. The analysts stated that the strategy may not have the longevity many expect, warning that easy upside may already be behind new companies that have recently pivoted towards a Bitcoin treasury. The analyst stated, “My instinct is that the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect. For many new entrants, it could already be over.” According to the analyst, it's already an uphill battle for new Bitcoin treasury companies who are struggling to establish themselves as investors prefer early adopters. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche.” Analysts believe that some companies are employing a Bitcoin treasury strategy to generate a quick profit without fully understanding its long-term implications or the purpose behind it. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing. I think it’ll take them some time to figure out. The weak ones might be acquired at a discount by the strong ones, and the trend could still have a few more legs in it.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) price action has remained subdued over the holiday weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered considerable volatility over the week, dropping to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. The price recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $108,000 and briefly crossed $110,000 on Thursday before losing momentum. BTC’s current range extends from $98,000 to $110,000. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return once markets open, potentially pushing the price to a new all-time high. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, crossing $106,000 and settling at $106,137. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC crossed $107,000 and settled at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline below $107,000 to settle at $106,980. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Source: TradingView Despite the positive momentum, BTC dropped over 1% on Monday, slipping below $108,000 and settling at $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33% to $105,742. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% rise. BTC lost momentum on Friday as sellers overwhelmed buyers. As a result, the price fell 1.42% to $108,097. BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday but is back in the red during the ongoing session, trading around $108,145 as sellers look to drive the price below $108,000.

2025-07-06T12:00:50,"XRP Stern Critic Predicts 900,800% XRP Price Rally","Bitcoin advocate and author Jason Williams has sparked conversation within the XRP community after making a provocative statement on social media. On Thursday, Williams tweeted that XRP is “going to 20,000 per coin,” a comment that, at first glance, appeared to endorse the notion of an extraordinary price surge. However, his follow-up responses made it clear that the post was intended to be sarcastic. XRP is going to 20k a coin. — Jason Ai. Williams (@GoingParabolic) July 3, 2025 The tweet was a direct commentary on recent claims by some XRP supporters suggesting that the token could experience exponential growth, with projections reaching as high as $20,000 . While the claim might seem bullish, Williams used it to criticize what he sees as speculative and exaggerated price predictions. Clarifying the “20,000” Comment Following his initial post, Williams responded to skepticism in the comments by sharing an image that showed 20,000 Lebanese pounds converting to approximately $0.22. His caption read, “It will happen,” indicating that his earlier statement was not a price prediction in USD. Rather, he was suggesting that XRP’s value could drop dramatically, drawing a comparison to a currency that has undergone significant devaluation. This sarcastic tone was a clear attempt to highlight what he considers the unrealistic nature of recent bullish projections made by certain XRP proponents. Instead of predicting a price surge, Williams implied the opposite, that XRP might lose value, not gain it. The tweet appeared to respond directly to a theory that has recently resurfaced within the XRP community. Originally proposed in 2022 by game developer Chad Steingraber, the theory suggests that XRP could reach $20,000 per unit under a scenario of massive institutional adoption. According to Steingraber, if major financial institutions begin to use XRP for global transactions, and if private ledgers absorb much of the token’s supply, a supply shock could occur. This, combined with increased demand from wealthy investors and hedge funds, could, in theory, cause the token’s price to rise dramatically. He also claims that public access to XRP would decline to below 100 million tokens, leading to panic buying. Steingraber frames today’s retail market as only the early stage of XRP’s future use as the core of a new global financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Around the Valuation Critics, including Williams, challenge the plausibility of such projections. A $20,000 price point would require an XRP market capitalization that exceeds the total value of the current global financial system. With XRP’s circulating supply of over 50 billion tokens, a price of $20,000 would translate into a market cap in the hundreds of trillions or more, a figure that is widely regarded as economically unfeasible. While some XRP advocates argue that market capitalization is not the best indicator of value and may not apply to XRP’s unique use case, there remains no widely accepted financial model that supports such extreme valuations. Jason Williams’s tweet serves as a direct critique of what he views as unrealistic optimism regarding XRP’s future value. While some supporters continue to speculate about massive institutional adoption and future price spikes, Williams’s sarcastic commentary underscores the importance of grounding such discussions in economic reality. The debate reveals the growing divide between XRP’s most enthusiastic supporters and those who urge caution and critical analysis.

2025-07-06T11:46:56,"We Asked 4 AIs How High Ripple (XRP) Will Go in 2025: The Answers Might Shock You","TL;DR Ripple’s price actions are a big prediction topic within the cryptocurrency community, with analysts and believers rushing to offer their insights and forecasts. However, we decided to take a different approach this time and asked four of the biggest AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini) about their take on the matter. 2025 Price Targets All four AI solutions seemed very coherent about XRP’s price potential this year, as Perplexity explained it: “Ripple’s (XRP) price in 2025 is broadly expected to rise significantly from current levels, with expert forecasts varying but generally bullish.” Although Ripple’s cross-border token has stalled in the past few months and is actually slightly in the red since the start of the year, all AIs had similar conclusions about its price moves until the end of the year. ChatGPT laid out three potential scenarios, with the conservative one being at $3.4, which would match the asset’s all-time (and yearly) high. The optimistic is set at $5-$6, and the “aggressive forecasts” put the token at $10-$15 by the end of the year. Google’s Gemini had similar ideas in mind, saying that “a realistic high could be in the $5-$10 range.” Perplexity also joined the $5-$10 club, which could be reached under “favorable conditions” (more on that later). Grok was slightly more specific and was the only one that said XRP can finish the year lower than its current price tag. It noted that a “realistic price range” for the asset this year is somewhere between $1.8 and $5.81. Although that’s a pretty wide range, it concluded that the most likely peak will come somewhere between $3 and $4.5. The Favorable Conditions When it came down to outlining the factors that could impact XRP’s price moves this year, the AIs were once again aligned in their answers. First, they mentioned regulatory clarity and the official conclusion of the lawsuit against the SEC. Although Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in March that the case had been resolved and there had been several developments on the matter, the judge overseeing the case has yet to agree fully . Second, the AIs brought up institutional adoption and bullish partnerships, such as those with Santander, SBI Holdings, and others. A spot XRP ETF will also play a significant role in the asset’s price trajectory this year, if approved, said the chatbots. According to ETF experts, the current odds stand at nearly 100%. Lastly, the AI solutions highlighted the overall crypto market trends: “Bitcoin’s post-halving performance and a pro-crypto U.S. administration under President Trump could fuel bullish sentiment across the crypto market, benefiting XRP,” – answered Grok, which was similar to what the others had to say. Despite these bullish predictions for 2025, all four chatbots clarified that these are just that – speculative forecasts that might or might not come to fruition. Investors should do their own research before allocating funds to any cryptocurrency (or other asset, for that matter).

According to ABC 7 News, Tracy Jeffords received a text supposedly from the toll fees payment platform FasTrak after a journey to San Francisco. Convinced the text was genuine, the Lake County, California resident entered his debit card details to complete the payment. But a day later, Jeffords received an actual letter from FasTrak saying he owed the toll fees payment platform money. It was then that Jeffords checked his bank account only to find that more than $3,300 was missing after a purchase on eBay was made using his debit card information, according to the report. ABC 7 News cites Jeffords saying, “It made me feel terrible. And the thing is, it’s going to happen to somebody else.” The Lake County resident disputed the charge with Wells Fargo but the trillion-dollar bank has so far refused to reimburse. His attempt to dispute the charge with eBay has also proven unsuccessful. According to an expert contacted by ABC 7 News, getting reimbursed for fraudulent debit card purchases is harder than for those made using a credit card. Jeffords has nonetheless vowed to fight on to get his money back, according to the report. He tells ABC 7 News, “It’d be everything to get it back, because it’s a lot for me.

In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel says that a slowdown is approaching for the Bitcoin treasury business model as the market becomes too crowded and competitive. “The problem is what happens if the Bitcoin price stays flat or starts to go down? You said his stock was up over a five-year basis by a huge amount, which is true, but if you look at year-to-date at its performance compared to Bitcoin miners, you’re starting to see that that performance is running into headwinds. In theory, a Bitcoin treasury company’s price should increase by upwards of two times whatever the Bitcoin price is increasing on a daily basis because of the leverage that they’re driving. And that’s not the case anymore. I think what we’re starting to see is a saturation of the Bitcoin treasury business market because to your point, they’re not in any other business, they’re taking over a company with a marginally profitable business and they’re turning it into an accumulator for Bitcoin. At the end of the day, you have a bunch of people competing for capital, and that capital is going to the highest return, which means the lowest multiple to NAV (net asset value), and over time, that multiple to NAV is eventually going to go to zero…” Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet .

Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday, Miller argued that Bitcoin’s structure challenges traditional assumptions about taxation. “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense,” Miller said, emphasizing that while traditional assets depend on government systems to enforce and record property rights, Bitcoin operates independently on its blockchain. Blockchain Enforces Ownership, Not Governments Miller, an early advocate for Bitcoin , explained that the digital asset eliminates the need for the administrative infrastructure typically required to manage ownership of assets like real estate. “When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what,” he said. He argued that taxes exist to enforce property rights within society, a function that Bitcoin’s blockchain already fulfills without government intervention. “The blockchain does that property automation for itself,” Miller noted. He also pointed out that since governments did not create Bitcoin, the idea of taxing it in the same way as physical property becomes questionable. Earlier this year, rumors circulated that Eric Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, had proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on certain cryptocurrencies in the U.S. While Miller acknowledged the discussion around exempting BTC from capital gains tax , he remarked, “Whether that ultimately happens or not, who knows, but it is very cool that there is no wash sale rule on Bitcoin.” When asked whether Bitcoin could ever face property taxes similar to those imposed on real estate, Miller noted there is a “good argument” for why it should not. Tax Uncertainty Shows It’s Still Early for Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin’s growing adoption, Miller highlighted that tax uncertainties continue to hinder institutional investors. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out,” he explained. “That’s why I continue to say it is still early because the taxation rules around it are really interesting,” he added, underscoring the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding BTC. Miller IV is the son of veteran investor Bill Miller III, who in January 2022 revealed he had allocated 50% of his net worth to BTC and investments in major industry players, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy and mining firm Stronghold Digital Mining.

2025-07-06T11:17:06,"Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened","Coinbase Institutional Research President David Duong said that the claims of “the largest Ethereum (ETH) short position in history”, which have been on the agenda in the cryptocurrency market in recent days, do not reflect the truth. According to Duong, these comments, based on data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), actually point to arbitrage strategies by institutional investors. According to CFTC cash-secured fund data, leveraged funds’ ETH short positions on the CME rose from $466 million in early May to $1.6 billion as of June 24. This $1.14 billion increase is almost identical to the net $1.16 billion inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs in June. Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Duong said this parallel is no coincidence, arguing that the increasing institutional interest in ETH spot ETFs is triggered by the base yield difference on the CME. The yield difference between spot and futures prices, which was 6% on an annual basis in February, increased to 8%-9% in May and June. According to Duong, this situation presented an attractive opportunity for institutional investors looking to arbitrage: buying spot ETH and selling futures ETH at the same time. Ultimately, according to Duong’s analysis, the increase in short positions on CME is not a reflection of negative expectations for Ethereum, but rather institutional arbitrage activity. Therefore, the presentation of this situation as “the largest short position in history” does not reflect market reality, according to Duong. *This is not investment advice.

The 4-hour chart displays a tightening triangle, where ETH is forming higher lows while encountering horizontal resistance at $2,558. The trendline remains intact, and the 50-period simple moving average is currently at $2,494.95. Momentum is fading. A series of doji and small-bodied candles in the yellow demand zone shows a standoff between buyers and sellers. #Ethereum Technical Update $ETH is coiling within a tight triangle above key support at $2,478.

If bulls can’t hold above $2,478, ETH will visit deeper support at $2,388 and $2,320. If above $2,558, the uptrend will continue to $2,639 and beyond. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The EMA structure remains bullish, with the 50-SMA above the 100-SMA, indicating a positive medium-term outlook despite recent hesitation. ETF Momentum Adds Fuel to the Setup While the price is sideways, Ethereum’s fundamentals are strengthening. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently said Ethereum ETFs could see up to $10 billion in inflows by the end of 2025. So far in 2025, ETH ETFs have seen over $1.5 billion in inflows, including a record $1.17 billion in June. Hougan attributes the surge in inflows to Ethereum’s growing role in tokenised assets, such as stocks and stablecoins. As Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for regulated finance, it’s getting serious attention from traditional asset managers. And a favourable SEC ruling that crypto staking is not a securities offering opens the door for staking-enabled ETH ETFs – products that will attract institutional yield-seeking capital in the coming months. Ethereum Key Trade Setup – Watching the Triangle Edge The Ethereum price prediction is currently neutral, as the market awaits a potential breakout. This is a defined risk-reward setup for both bulls and bears. Here’s what to watch: Long Entry: Above $2,560 with volume confirmation Upside Targets: $2,639 to $2,723 Stop-Loss: Below $2,478 support Short Entry: Below $2,478 with a strong candle Downside Targets: $2,388 to $2,320 In summary, ETH is at a crossroads. The price is still range-bound, with ETF flows and staking providing the wind in its back. Above $2,560, and it could be a momentum play, but traders should be prepared to pivot; whoever gives up first will set the tone for Q3.

2025-07-06T11:00:46,"Bitcoin’s True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns","Bitcoin’s climb past $110,000 this week has reignited a fresh round of bullish calls. Prices hit $110,150 on July 3 and traded a little past $108,000 level at last check, showing a small 0.41% dip in 24 hours but a 1.20% rise over seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest This steady move higher has drawn voices from social media, stirring debate on whether Bitcoin is truly underpriced or in danger of slipping back below key levels. Undervalued At $110K According to Altcoin Daily, Bitcoin at $110,000 is “undervalued,” with the analysts arguing there’s plenty of room to run. That bold claim has fans cheering, and some even dream of $1,000,000 down the road. Bitcoin at $110k is undervalued! [screenshot this] — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) July 3, 2025 Other users have pushed back, asking what on‑chain data or metrics back up this view. They point out that until Bitcoin clears resistance at $110,500, a real breakout isn’t confirmed. Based on reports from market trackers, global liquidity is on the rise. Market observers picked up on that, saying more cash floating around can push Bitcoin higher. Rising liquidity often fuels big moves in risk assets. Still, traders keep an eye on futures funding rates and miner sell‑pressure, looking for clues if a pullback is brewing. Global Liquidity just hit a new ATH. Bitcoin will follow! pic.twitter.com/gH1Kl2D1Zw — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 3, 2025 Mixed Views Online Some followers argue that inflation and new tariffs could dampen Bitcoin’s rally. Others note that central banks are still buying time before any rate hikes, which may give crypto another boost. The back‑and‑forth on social media reads like a mini war room, with short comments and deep threads floating around. Plenty of voices, but few hard answers. Past Bull Runs Altcoin Daily wasn’t shy about past calls either. Just days earlier, they said that once Bitcoin tops $150,000, investors would wish they’d bought more at lower prices. That kind of hindsight talk can be stirring, but it doesn’t change the here‑and‑now charts or the macro calendar. Exec Calls For Hedge Based on remarks by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, now could be a good time to buy Bitcoin. Hougan pointed to Ray Dalio’s warnings about US debt, which has swelled past $7 trillion in annual spending against $5 trillion in revenue. With each household on the hook for roughly $230,000, Dalio says holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against future money‑print risks.

2025-07-06T11:00:03,"Bitcoin Binary CDD Confirms Long-Term Confidence: Strong HODLer Conviction","Bitcoin is gearing up for a potential breakout into price discovery, with price action showing notable strength above key support levels. After an attempt to close above the all-time high of $112,000 on Friday fell short, bulls are now focused on securing a strong weekly close that could trigger a new leg higher. The market is watching closely, as the coming days may determine whether BTC is ready to break free from its current range and chart new highs. On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds to the optimism. The Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—which tracks the movement of long-dormant coins—shows that ancient coin activity is currently twice below its annual moving average. Historically, spikes in CDD often signal the beginning of distribution phases by long-term holders. The current subdued activity, however, suggests that seasoned investors remain confident, opting to hold rather than sell. This low CDD activity, paired with steady price action and strong support at the $108K level, paints a constructive picture for Bitcoin. If bullish momentum continues, BTC could enter uncharted territory, reinforcing its position as the leading asset in the crypto market. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Inactive Bitcoin has remained in a tight consolidation phase below its $112,000 all-time high since late May, but momentum is building for a potential breakout. The leading cryptocurrency is up 10% since June 22 and continues to hold strong above key demand zones, particularly around the $108,000 level. This ongoing resilience has analysts closely watching for a decisive push above $112K, an event that could ignite a new wave of bullish price discovery. While short-term direction remains uncertain, the long-term structure suggests continued strength. According to analysts, once BTC breaches the current resistance zone, it could move swiftly to new highs, fueled by strong investor confidence and supportive on-chain signals. Top analyst Axel Adler shared an analysis of the Binary CDD indicator, which sheds light on the behavior of long-term holders. The CDD measures when older, previously dormant coins begin to move, often signaling distribution phases. Adler notes that ancient coin activity is now twice below its annual moving average, indicating that long-term holders are not selling into the recent strength. Interestingly, the recent movement of coins linked to Roger Ver had little lasting impact on market dynamics, aside from temporary FOMO. In previous market cycles, spikes in CDD coincided with cycle tops, as seen near $70K and $100K. The absence of such a spike now suggests that the current rally remains structurally healthy and far from an overheated top. As Bitcoin holds its ground and ancient coins remain inactive, the setup appears favorable for a breakout. If bulls can reclaim $112K with conviction, Bitcoin could enter price discovery, setting the tone for the broader crypto market in the weeks ahead. BTC Price Holds Key Support As Bulls Defend Range Highs Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight consolidation range, just below the $112K all-time high, with price action currently hovering around $108,245. As shown in the 12-hour chart, BTC has tested the $109,300 resistance level multiple times but has yet to break through it with conviction. Meanwhile, bulls are defending the $106,000–$106,500 area, which is reinforced by the 50 and 100-period SMAs, acting as dynamic support. Volume remains relatively low compared to the May breakout, indicating a potential buildup before a major move. The current consolidation between $103,600 and $109,300 mirrors a classic high-timeframe range, with short-term liquidity traps forming both above and below. A confirmed breakout above $109,300 would likely open the door to price discovery, while a breakdown below $103,600 could trigger a retest of lower support levels. The structure remains bullish as long as BTC holds above $106K and especially the $103.6K horizontal support zone. With multiple higher lows and bulls defending critical levels, the market appears to be coiling for a decisive move. Traders should watch for volume expansion and a clear break of resistance or support in the coming days to confirm the next trend direction.

2025-07-06T10:33:03,"Drake References Bitcoin in New Track “What Did I Miss?”","Musical artist Drake has referenced Bitcoin in his latest song “What Did I Miss?”, released on Saturday, underscoring the digital asset’s expanding presence in mainstream culture. The mention appears in the song’s first verse, where Drake draws a comparison between Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and the ups and downs of public perception. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week. I don’t give a fuck if you love me. I don’t give a fuck if you like me,” Drake raps, capturing the resilience often associated with Bitcoin investors who continue to hold despite market swings. Drake’s connection to Bitcoin is not new. In 2022, the artist made headlines after wagering $1 million worth of Bitcoin on the Super Bowl matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams, reflecting his early interest in the asset class. Bitcoin Finds Place in Pop Culture Bitcoin references in popular music, television, and art are becoming increasingly common, signaling the digital asset’s gradual movement toward mass adoption. Similar to how past technologies like the internet and mobile phones crossed over into culture before widespread adoption, Bitcoin’s appearance in a Drake track adds another marker to its evolving narrative. In 2022, Blockware, a Bitcoin mining hardware provider, forecasted that global Bitcoin adoption would reach 10% by 2030, modeling the growth on historical adoption curves of paradigm-shifting technologies. Meanwhile, a March 2025 report by Bitcoin financial services firm River indicated that around 4% of the global population currently holds Bitcoin, with the asset still accounting for less than 1% of its total addressable market. River’s report also highlighted that adoption rates tend to be higher in developed nations, with institutional participation playing a key role in the current cycle of Bitcoin growth. Institutional Adoption Continues to Expand The increasing presence of Bitcoin-themed investment products , such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has further removed barriers to entry for both institutional and retail investors, enabling exposure without the complexities of self-custody or onchain transactions. Corporations including Strategy and Metaplanet have transitioned into Bitcoin treasury firms , while others have opted to hold smaller allocations as a hedge against inflation, geopolitical risks, and the uncertainty that comes with global fragmentation. These institutional moves align with Bitcoin’s emergence as a financial instrument with potential to protect value while signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term role. Drake’s lyrical nod to Bitcoin may be brief, but it underlines the asset’s ongoing shift from a niche financial experiment to a symbol within global culture.

2025-07-06T10:30:08,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Post-$50B Whale Dump, BTC Price Holds Steady – Can Institutional Control Drive New Highs?","Over the past year, long-time Bitcoin whales, early adopters, miners, and anonymous mega-holders have offloaded more than 500,000 BTC, worth roughly $50 billion at today’s prices. This selling spree hasn’t collapsed the market. Instead, institutions have stepped in, absorbing even more than the whales let go. Data from 10x Research shows that institutional players, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries, and asset managers, snapped up nearly 900,000 BTC during the same period. That’s a staggering shift in ownership dynamics, signalling Bitcoin’s slow evolution from a speculative trade to a structured allocation in traditional portfolios. LATEST: Bitcoin whales have dumped over 500,000 $BTC worth $50B in the past year while institutions absorbed nearly 900,000 $BTC , signaling a control shift in the Bitcoin market per Bloomberg. pic.twitter.com/qkehBgsb2G — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) July 4, 2025 Whale Sell-Off: 500,000 BTC ($50B+) Institutional Buying: 900,000 BTC ETFs’ Net Inflows (Since Jan Approval): Nearly match whale exits Interestingly, much of this churn has been silent. Instead of open-market selling, many whales are now using BTC as collateral or directly contributing it to equity-linked financial vehicles. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Identity Is Quietly Changing Bitcoin’s price action tells a quieter story. Despite bullish headlines—including crypto-friendly policy shifts under the Trump administration and treasury announcements from firms like Figma—BTC has hovered below its $110,000 peak for months. According to Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, many whales are not just selling—they’re restructuring their exposure. “We’re seeing whales convert BTC into equity exposure through in-kind contributions,” he notes, pointing to growing activity in crypto-to-stock financing deals. This realignment means less wild price swings and more predictable accumulation, especially as institutional investors prioritise long-term holding over short-term speculation. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $107.8K Support on Watch The Bitcoin price prediction is neutral, as BTC is currently consolidating just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($107,840) from its recent swing move. The 2-hour chart shows a low-volatility “fib squeeze,” trapped between the 50% and 61.8% levels. Price sits between key moving averages: the 50-SMA at $108,624 and the 100-SMA at $107,944.

2025-07-06T10:29:52,"Is XRP a Good Investment? Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Clearer Path to Bitcoin-Level Returns","In the world of crypto speculation, missing out on early Bitcoin is a badge of regret many investors still wear. The longing for the “next big one” has become a running joke in trading circles. But now and then, a project steps forward that doesn’t just hype the future, it builds it. That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and this time, it’s trending for all the right reasons. XRP’s Status: Good Project, Slower Climb Let’s be fair. XRP has weathered more storms than most coins. Between SEC battles and community doubt, it’s earned its spot as a seasoned player. It still dominates cross-border payments and has loyal institutional backing. But here’s the catch: growth feels slow, boxed in by regulation and aging infrastructure. Even the most optimistic XRP price predictions for 2025 circle modest gains. For those holding long-term, it might deliver eventually. But if you’re eyeing explosive potential like early Bitcoin, XRP simply isn’t built for that kind of sprint. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: The Clearer Path Forward Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just echo Bitcoin’s legacy. It expands on it. By combining energy-efficient Proof-of-Work with high-speed Delegated Proof-of-Stake in a dual-layer architecture, BTC-S unlocks real scalability and real speed. The system processes over 10,000 transactions per second with two-second finality, something unheard of in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Here’s what makes BTC-S technically and financially irresistible: Dual-layer chain for simultaneous speed and security PoW-based base layer reinforced with DPoS for high efficiency Validator rotation and adaptive difficulty that reduce centralization risks Fully programmable smart contracts designed for modern DeFi apps Power-optimized mining built for mobile devices, including the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App This is not a concept. Testnet benchmarks are in, the code is functional, and development is active. While XRP crawls through courtrooms, Bitcoin Solaris sprints through milestones. No More Barriers, Just Scalable Wealth With Bitcoin Solaris This Is Why It’s Trending Crypto influencers have taken notice. In fact, detailed reviews by content creators like Crypto Show are laying out exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is making waves. They highlight its DeFi readiness, growing community, and disruptive potential as a decentralized finance backbone. This isn’t surface-level hype; it’s a serious technical analysis that confirms what early adopters already suspect: this could be one of 2025’s defining projects. And the buzz isn’t empty. The project has passed independent reviews from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , giving added weight to its technical credibility. The Presale Path to Bitcoin-Level Wealth BTC-S is currently in phase 10 of its presale. The price is set at $10, with the next phase rising to $11 and a launch target of $20. That’s a potential 150 percent return before the project even hits major exchanges. Only around 4 weeks left until launch Over $6 million already raised 13,650+ users joined and counting One of the shortest and fastest-moving presales of the year And this isn’t just about the token price. The infrastructure is being built for long-term utility, including a Mining Power Marketplace and wallet integrations. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using wallets like Trust Wallet or Metamask for smooth delivery. Real Wealth Through Smart Mobile Mining This is where things get exciting. Unlike traditional mining that demands expensive rigs, BTC-S allows you to mine using your phone through the upcoming Solaris Nova App. It’s a gamified, lightweight process that doesn’t drain your battery or bandwidth. Check your potential earnings using the mining calculator . This isn’t just innovative, it’s revolutionary for users in regions with low hardware access. Mobile-first mining means easier entry for everyone Real-time leaderboard features add community engagement Smart contracts ensure secure mining rewards Whether you’re at home, in a café, or commuting, mining is now possible without needing a warehouse full of GPUs. And Yes, There’s a Referral Program Too Bitcoin Solaris takes it a step further by offering a double rewards referral system during its presale. Referrers get 5 percent in BTC-S, and the person they refer gets a 5 percent bonus in tokens. It’s a rare system that benefits both sides and fuels community growth. You can grab your referral link from your dashboard, share it across platforms, and earn passively while expanding the BTC-S network. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini-games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards. checkout all the details here. Conclusion: This Might Be the One Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to mimic Bitcoin. It’s building its own future, faster, more accessible, and ready for the world of decentralized finance. From its mobile-first mining to its explosive presale momentum, BTC-S is putting real tools into real hands. XRP might still deliver on its promises in time, but if you’re looking for the kind of opportunity Bitcoin once offered, Bitcoin Solaris is where the path begins.

2025-07-06T10:10:02,"Michael Saylor should not burn his Bitcoin | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Michael Saylor plans to burn all of his Bitcoin ( BTC ), which means he is burning your lifeboat to safety from inflation, and that helps the few, not many. Saylor’s MicroStrategy plans to increase the number of BTC it holds. The accumulation plan again raises questions about Bitcoin’s scarcity, and the questions that arise when few entities acquire such a large percentage of the supply. You might also like: Cryptocurrency’s best ideas will never launch | Opinion Saylor has said himself that he wants to hold one percent of the overall Bitcoin supply. Surely, he is looking to acquire as many BTC as possible for himself. His plan to burn his entire stash should have raised more eyebrows than it has, while also igniting a fervent debate about the implications for Bitcoin’s overall resilience. Not that it’s any of my business, but I have been thinking lately about all the reasons why Michael Saylor, as a prominent Bitcoin advocate and holder through MicroStrategy, should absolutely not, under any circumstances, destroy his Bitcoin via burning. It is like burning the lifeboats on the Titanic as it sinks Burning Bitcoin refers to the process of taking BTC out of circulation forever by sending them to inaccessible addresses that cannot be accessed or used for transactions. Saylor could use his Bitcoin to further his legacy. He could donate the funds to Bitcoin’s developers, build libraries, hospitals, public squares, and more. His name could appear on public spaces the world over. There are many technical reasons, as well, as to why Saylor should not burn his Bitcoin upon his death, but instead use them to bolster his already impressive legacy and even invest directly into Bitcoin’s future. Many BTC have already been lost permanently, as a result of lost private keys, hardware issues, and so on. It is estimated that roughly 17-23% of all BTC have been lost, including wallets thought to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, untouched since 2011. Lost BTC contributes to the asset’s scarcity. Therefore, Bitcoin is even scarcer than the 21 million hardcoded to exist. Bitcoin is a non-reproducible asset, meaning once they are sent to an irretrievable Bitcoin address, there is no getting them back. You can’t mine more Bitcoin. That’s part of the brilliance of Bitcoin, as has been covered ad nauseum heretofore by the wide-ranging voices of the so-called Bitcoin Community. Bitcoin is about resistance to centralized control, a hedge against inflation, as well as state overreach. Bitcoin is financial emancipation. Burning Bitcoin symbolically undermines the rebellion. There would be less Bitcoin to save people from inflationary hegemony. Fewer lifeboats. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is sacrosanct. It mimics gold’s natural scarcity. Saylor destroying his BTC invites speculation about further burns and damages trust in Bitcoin’s predictable issuance, and introduces arbitrariness. If Saylor were to destroy the Bitcoin, the circulating supply of Bitcoin would be reduced. This would create scarcity that could undermine Bitcoin’s monetary function. Arbitrary supply shocks don’t help Bitcoin’s case for transparency. Burning his Bitcoin erodes confidence. Saylor supports Bitcoin’s legitimacy by preserving his holdings and putting them to good use. By not destroying his Bitcoin, Saylor encourages adoption and reinforces its value, because his adoption of Bitcoin signals that the digital asset enjoys historical acceptance. Saylor holding onto his Bitcoin and then putting them to some productive use in his will inspires others to also hold Bitcoin. Saylor should ensure Bitcoin remains part of the economic order for future generations in line with Satoshi’s vision of sound money. If Saylor preserves his Bitcoin by passing it onto heirs or placing them into a trust, Saylor bolsters Bitcoin as a monetary network. Saylor could use his BTC to support its role as a bulwark against statism and an example of sound money. Burning Bitcoin weakens both Saylor’s legacy and Bitcoin at the same time. Saylor might consider letting his Bitcoin remain in the market through inheritance or charitable allocation—or otherwise—to preserve private property and economic productivity. With that said, they are Saylor’s Bitcoin, and he can do whatever he wants with them, including add them to the millions of bitcoins which have already been lost for good in the history of Bitcoin, making the coming supply crunch all the more likely, and bitcoin less likely help the greatest number of people as possible.

The DXY witnessed a 10.8% drop in the first six months of 2025, the worst since its 14.8% decline in the first half of 1973, back when Richard Nixon was the country’s president, reports Bloomberg. The dollar dumping comes as the US money supply has exploded to a new record high. The latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) shows that M2, which tracks the total amount of readily available money circulating in the US financial system, stood at $21.942 trillion as of May 2025, shattering its previous peak of $21.749 trillion recorded in April 2022. Source: FRED As the amount of money surges in the country, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX strategy, Meera Chandan, says that the second half of the year will likely not be better for the American currency. In a new episode of JPMorgan’s Making Sense podcast, Chandan expects the dollar to perform poorly against other major currencies in the coming months amid Europe’s improving fiscal outlook and America’s rising deficits and national debt. “The outlook is still bearish across the board. I think it’s going to be very hard for us to move the needle here to change our view there. I mean to put specific targets, we’ve got the euro/dollar projected to $1.20 to $1.22, dollar/CNY (Chinese yuan) 7.10 CNY, dollar/yen 140 JPY. So as you can tell, it’s still a pretty bearish view and a broad-based one at that, including for cyclical currencies such as the Aussie dollar, we’re looking for a $0.68. And the reason behind it is very much the same reasons why we turned bearish earlier in the year, which is that the US data is going to moderate, catch down to the rest of the world. You have obviously the European fiscal policy, which has turned more growth-supportive, which is helping fiscal policy outside of the US wherever possible, will turn more growth-supportive. And finally you do have the US structural issues that one does have to assign some discount to, but overall, the view is unchanged and still squarely dollar bearish.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-06T09:47:08,"Renowned Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Price Targets of 400,000 and Then 1 Million Dollars for BTC","Famous Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger drew attention to the temporary advantages that interest rate cuts would provide to the fiat money system, but said that in the long run, Bitcoin could exceed $1 million with a strong uptrend. In his assessment on the social media platform X, Krueger argued that Bitcoin will continue to strengthen with the deflationary pressures that artificial intelligence will create in a low interest rate environment. The following statements stood out in Krueger's statement: “Reducing interest rates to 1% would give the fiat money system a 10-year breath. However, at the end of this period, artificial intelligence will come into play and create a strong deflationary effect. Bitcoin could exceed $400,000 or even $1 million much earlier and easily in this time period.” Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Stating that Bitcoin follows a long-term “power law” curve, Krueger argued that companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets (e.g. MicroStrategy, RIOT, MARA) are in a much stronger position than their competitors. He stated that these companies will gain serious advantages in the coming years thanks to their Bitcoin-focused strategies. For these reasons, Krueger stated that he predicts that many more companies will buy Bitcoin in the next 5 years. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-06T09:35:21,"Drake Compares Love Life to Bitcoin Price Swings in New Lyrics","Grammy-winning artist Drake has dropped a new song titled What Did I Miss? that compares his turbulent love life to the notorious volatility of Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: Drake compares his love life to Bitcoin’s price swings in his new song What Did I Miss?. His lyrics highlight Bitcoin’s growing presence in mainstream pop culture. Global BTC adoption sits at 4% today, far below forecasts of 10% by 2030. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week,” the Toronto rapper raps . This isn’t Drake’s first dance with Bitcoin. In 2022, he wagered $1 million worth of BTC on the Super Bowl, a move that grabbed headlines and underscored his willingness to engage with crypto beyond casual name-drops. Drake’s Lyrics Show Bitcoin Breaking Into Pop Culture Drake’s latest verse signals how Bitcoin continues to weave itself into mainstream culture, appearing not just in financial headlines but also in music, television, and art. As Bitcoin references pop up more often in pop culture, some see it as a sign that the digital asset is edging closer to widespread recognition. Historical forecasts from Blockware predicted Bitcoin adoption could reach 10% of the global population by 2030, comparing its trajectory to transformative technologies like electricity and the Internet. However, a recent report from River pegged current adoption at just 4%, showing that while crypto has made strides, there’s still a long road ahead. The report highlighted that adoption tends to be stronger in developed economies, where access to financial infrastructure and regulatory clarity is more robust. Meanwhile, institutional interest has continued to rise. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have pivoted to holding Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, aiming to guard against inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. Bitcoin ETFs and other investment products have further opened the door to retail and institutional investors, lowering barriers to exposure by removing the need for self-custody or direct onchain transactions. Bitcoin Adoption Gains Ground With Texas State Reserve Last month, Texas became the first U.S. state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, marking a significant step toward mainstreaming digital assets at the state level. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, setting up a standalone Bitcoin fund overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. Unlike previous attempts in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas’s Bitcoin reserve will operate entirely outside the state treasury, providing legal protections against routine fund reallocations. A companion bill, HB 4488, further secures the fund’s status, ensuring it remains intact regardless of future Bitcoin purchases. State Senator Charles Schwertner, the bill’s sponsor, argued that Texas should consider Bitcoin as it does land and gold, highlighting its performance over the past decade. Texas’s move comes as other states pull back from similar plans. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve .

2025-07-06T09:30:20,"Bitcoin Consolidation Continues: 2 Key Support Levels To Watch","Bitcoin (BTC) prices showed a sideways movement in the past day producing no significant changes. Following the recent rejection at the $110,000 price range, the maiden cryptocurrency failed to break out of a descending consolidatory channel; therefore, fears on the current status of the bull market remain intact. Amidst the current mood of uncertainty, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has identified two important support levels in the advent of a price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means On-Chain Data Reveals Strong Bitcoin Support At $106,500 And $98,500 In an X post on July 5, Ali Martinez shares a potentially impactful on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market. Using data from the In/Out Money Around Price (IOMAP) Chart from Sentora, the analyst shares that major support zones have emerged that could play a crucial role in shaping the BTC’s short-term price direction. The IOMAP chart analyzes Bitcoin wallet addresses and the average prices at which they acquired BTC, giving insights into potential zones of buying or selling pressure. Essentially, it shows where holders are currently in profit i.e. in the money” or at a loss i.e. out of the money. From the chart, it is observed that 1.68 million addresses bought 1.28 million BTC between $104,982 and $108,190, with an average acquisition price of $106,738. Historically, such large concentrations of buying activity tend to form strong support zones, as holders may defend their positions from slipping into loss. Therefore, this development makes the $106,700 range a formidable near-term support level. A second significant support level is identified in the $95,247 to $98,566 range, where 1.7 million addresses acquired 1.25 million BTC at an average price of $96,901. Should Bitcoin lose its footing above $106,000, this lower range would act as the next major cushion, potentially absorbing downward momentum. However, a decisive price close below $96,901 would confirm significant bearish intent by the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details Bitcoin Market Overview According to data from the IOMAP chart, around 89.36% of all BTC addresses are “in the money,” meaning their holdings were purchased at a lower price than the current market value. This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting the majority of market participants are in profit and thus less pressured to sell. Meanwhile, only 10.36% of addresses are “out of the money,” highlighting the relatively low risk of widespread panic selling, unless Bitcoin were to break below these critical levels highlighted above. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $108,154 reflecting a 0.24% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, it’s daily trading volume is down by 27.09% and valued at $31.04 billion.

2025-07-06T09:25:55,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? XRP Price Prediction As Ripple Moves Into Banking with FCC Filing","All eyes are on XRP right now after the recent filing of Ripple's banking application to the FCC. Considering this has happened just after Ripple's decision to p112ut an end to its standoff with the SEC, hopes have risen that XRP could make a comeback, perhaps even cross its $3 resistance in the coming days. This has given weight to the view that XRP could topple Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now, or does it merely hint at the arrival of investor opportunities with a variety of assets to pick from? Ripple Applying for National Bank Charter from the OCC - Brad Garlinghouse The announcement about Ripple's banking application was made by Brad Garlinghouse, who, on X, posted the news stating that this approach could put more federal oversight on Ripple, which could bolster its trust factor, transforming it into the bridge to connect traditional and decentralized financial institutions. However, that's not all, as the company has also filed for a Fed Master Account via Standard Custody. This could help Ripple to hold $RLUSD (Ripple Stablecoin) directly from the Fed and gain an additional layer of security. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Just as expected, community reactions to the news have been positive. Some have said this is a materialization of a dream consisting of Ripple becoming a bank, which clears the way for XRP to reach $100. However, others have asked how XRP will fit into the banking license. Impact of the News on the XRP Price While investors were expecting the news to have a major impact on the XRP price, that, unfortunately, wasn't the case. The DeFi token's value is still consolidating around the $2.2 level, and whatever green candles it was able to print were corrected the next day. That said, a macro-analysis of the price chart shows that the XRP price has been following an ascending channel ever since it dropped to the $1.9 level on June 22, and there have been no signs of the price action stopping. Furthermore, since the US government has been very progressive about crypto, chances are high that Ripple's application could be approved. That could help with streamlining crypto into the traditional financial space, giving XRP much-needed long-term upside. It is also possible for the crypto to reach $3 in the coming days. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now? The answer to this could arguably be yes. However, until the DeFi crypto crosses the $2.6 mark to retest the $3 level, investors should stay cautious, since it will only take one long red candle to change the course of the XRP price action. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Smart Investor Picks During the Current Ecosystem BTC Bull Ripple's growth would consolidate the market's belief that the altcoin season has indeed arrived. However, that does not mean Bitcoin would lose any of its shine, as despite all the news about Ripple's legal qualms, the apex crypto continues to be the major driver of the cryptocurrency market. BTC Bull is a project that taps into that particular market, offering users a standard meme coin experience with a robust touch. While no long-term use cases have been mentioned by the official website, the project has continued to delight customers thanks to its social media posts as well as unique mechanics. The project has tied its token burns and Bitcoin airdrop model with Bitcoin's growth, which is a subtle way to grow alongside the apex crypto. While this move could be seen as a gimmick by many, the fact that the project has managed to raise upwards of $8 million already means there could be more to the project than meets the eye. The token is launching soon, with an application to CoinGecko already filed. Furthermore, there are many analysts already bullish about the launch, stating that BTC Bull could achieve a 1000% growth after going live on the price charts. Snorter Another crypto that could be considered one of the top offerings among crypto pre-sales is Snorter . Snorter is a meme coin powering an automated crypto trading bot that lets investors find and trade top-performing Solana cryptos. What further elevates the appeal of Snorter is the fact that it is accessible via Telegram. Being one of the leading messaging apps for crypto gives it access to a range of unique attributes. Not only is the platform easy to use, but the automated sniping tool is also equipped with all kinds of security features. In addition to the perks that come with the bot, Snorter is also very up to the mark when it comes to highlighting its memes. The main animal chosen to highlight this project, an aardvark, has been used to draw an equivalence between an aardvark's snout that it uses to fetch and Snorter's approach to sniffing the best cryptocurrency investment projects. While Snorter's connection to XRP isn't direct, the fact that XRP has the potential to become the biggest altcoin ultimately means unique projects with niche perks could gain community attention quickly. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a cryptocurrency project whose core idea is to inject utility into the Bitcoin network, and it aims to accomplish this using Bitcoin's first L2 scaling solution. The tech-related documents of the project show that developers are hard at work, trying to make it a reality. Three technologies have been implemented for this purpose: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge. The L2 scaling solution will reportedly help the Bitcoin network's transaction mechanics through off-chain aid. With the Solana Virtual Machine, developers are hoping for more DeFi applications to be built on the Bitcoin network, and with a Canonical Bridge, communications will be established between Bitcoin Hyper and Bitcoin. It is the project's simple premise that has allowed it to gain so much momentum, and in presale it has raised close to $2 million already. So, for XRP fans looking for an offbeat crypto with a strong focus on utility, Bitcoin Hyper could be a good investment. Conclusion Ripple's entry into the banking sector could lead to a major shift in the world of crypto. It could signal crypto to become more mainstream, leading to increased participation. Tokens that are still available on presale could take advantage of this situation, surging upon launch. Therefore, this ""best crypto to buy now list"" focuses on cryptocurrency ICOs. Each ICO has its own unique attribute, giving traders the opportunity to diversify their investments. And as crypto goes mainstream, these picks could yield massive gains, both in the short and the long term. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-06T09:23:51,"Brazil’s Central Bank Hack Sparks $40M Crypto Laundering in BTC, ETH","A sophisticated cyberattack on C&M Software, a technology provider for Brazil’s Central Bank, has triggered a wave of crypto laundering, with at least $40 million in stolen funds funneled into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Key Takeaways: Hackers stole nearly $148 million from Brazilian banks by breaching C&M Software’s systems. At least $40 million was laundered into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, according to ZachXBT. Authorities froze $50 million linked to the hack, but much of the stolen crypto remains missing. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged the laundering after tracing large sums moving through Latin American over-the-counter desks and exchanges. The attack stands as one of Brazil’s most significant financial breaches to date. Hackers Target C&M, Key Link to Brazil’s PIX Payment Network The hack targeted C&M, a key intermediary connecting smaller banks and fintechs to the Central Bank’s infrastructure, including PIX, the country’s widely used instant payments system. According to Brazilian authorities, hackers exploited credentials sold by João Nazareno Roque , a 48-year-old IT worker at C&M, who received the equivalent of $2,770 for his corporate login details. Local news outlet g1 Globo reported that Roque didn’t just sell his credentials; he also assisted in building a system to facilitate the theft, netting an additional payment of about $1,800. Using this inside access, hackers orchestrated a coordinated attack early on June 30, siphoning approximately 800 million reais, or nearly $148 million, from reserve accounts of six financial institutions. $140M HACK in Brazil – Insider Sold Access for Just $2.7K?! ZachXBT reports a $140M breach in Brazil, where an insider allegedly sold system access for only $2.7K. Around $30–40M was funneled into crypto via LatAm OTC desks. One of the biggest insider leaks in recent memory?… pic.twitter.com/ehMqjuQGCi — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 4, 2025 The fraudulent transfers went undetected for nearly two and a half hours. The breach only came to light when BMP, one of the affected institutions, flagged suspicious transactions. BMP’s CEO, Carlos Benitez, said his bank alone lost roughly $73.8 million but managed to recover about $29.5 million. A Brazilian court has since frozen accounts suspected of receiving stolen funds, recovering approximately $50 million so far. However, the full scope of the laundering operation remains under investigation, with significant sums still unaccounted for. Following the incident, the Central Bank suspended parts of C&M’s access to its systems as authorities worked to contain the damage. Roque was arrested on July 3, two days after the hack, and remains in custody as the investigation continues. Officials said no retail customers suffered direct losses, as the stolen funds were limited to institutional reserve balances held at the Central Bank. Crypto Networks Emerge as Escape Route for Crimes The latest breach underscores growing fears about crypto’s role as a conduit for conventional financial crimes. Digital assets offer liquidity and a level of pseudonymity that traditional cash transactions can’t match, enabling swift movement of illicit funds at scale. Stablecoins, in particular, have drawn the attention of criminal networks. The Financial Action Task Force recently warned that stablecoins pose increasing risks when used by illicit groups, especially in the absence of coordinated global oversight. Brazil’s recent heist mirrors a series of high-profile crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit hack and Chinese authorities dismantling a $136 million laundering ring that used digital currencies for cross-border money flows. Nevertheless, Brazilian officials are now working to trace the stolen funds across various blockchain networks, coordinating with international agencies to freeze assets and identify those responsible for one of the nation’s largest financial cyberattacks.

2025-07-06T09:15:30,"Hot FOMO Bull Market for Bitcoin Likely Approaching As BTC Indicator Begins To Inch Upward: PlanB","Widely followed quant analyst PlanB says that one indicator is suggesting a return to a FOMO (fear of missing out)-style bull market for Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new video update, PlanB tells his 215,000 YouTube subscribers that the crypto king’s rising relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures when an asset is overbought or oversold, suggests that rallies are coming over the next several months. According to the analyst, based on historical precedent, if BTC can hit an RSI of 75 on the monthly chart, a months-long “hot” FOMO bull market will follow. “We had some FOMO and disappointment last year, and that’s why this RSI average shows a little wobble here. Well, I expected [that], and actually, that’s what we’re seeing last month. It picked up the upward slope again. So I expect [BTC] to continue toward [an RSI of] 75, because if you look here in 2019, after the wobble, it returned to the former levels before the wobble. We have seen 75 RSI already three or five times, so I think we’re going to return to that level… That means if that were to happen this month in July, then July would [see BTC] end at $125,000ish… And after that, of course, I expect some really hot FOMO bull months of 80 RSI, 80+ like we’ve seen in all the bull markets. Even the lousy 2021 bull markets had five months above RSI 80. So that’s what I expect.” Source: PlanB/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $107,992 at time of writing.
