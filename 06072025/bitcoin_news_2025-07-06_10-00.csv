2025-07-06T07:24:45,"Ethereum Price Fell 2% In June But Has These 4 Bullish Signs Going Into July","June was a lackluster month for crypto market gains amid global uncertainty looming over international tariff policy and the future direction of US central bank rates. US Stocks Outpaced Ethereum In June For the 30 day window ending Friday, Jun. 27, the S&P 500 Index gained +4.25%. The push overcame serious resistance from the tariff nail biters and took the broad US stock benchmark to a historic record close Friday. But after running from $76,200 on 4/8 to $111,600 on 5/22, a +46% gain in a little over a month, Bitcoin’s price took some time to cool down in June. The cryptocurrency charted minor gains, which could be seen as a positive in the face of massive international turmoils and geopolitical shocks. Meanwhile, Ethereum corrected by 24% before bouncing off the Jun. 22 support to finalize a 2% loss for the 30 days ending Friday, Jun. 30th. So does ETH have a problem that Bitcoin doesn’t? Not really. Ethereum is a smaller currency by market cap, about 14% of Bitcoin’s size. Traders still perceive it as a more speculative bet. So it tends to move in the same direction as BTC — by larger percentages. That means on the way down, losses are frequently greater. But on the way up, gains are often greater too. For example, during the crypto market’s rally from early April through early June, Bitcoin made a +46% gain. But during the same rally, Ethereum gained +100%, rising from the $1,400 handle to the $2,800 level. Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts Double rainbow all the way across the sky? Bitcoin is by and large the biggest leading indicator for the rest of the crypto market’s prices, including Ethereum. It appears to have a long ways to go before topping out this year or next. Based on popular and authoritative analysts’ price targets for Bitcoin in 2025, it’s pacing to enter July and Q3 at 50% to 66% of its peak price before this cycle is over. That means it could double or gain by half again its June price levels before the year is over. Standard Chartered, Bernstein, Galaxy Digital, and Peter Brandt all expect $150,000 to $200,000 for BTC sometime in the next six months. Bitcoin’s long-term price trend rainbow chart confirms these projections. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s own long-term trend chart is shaping up to signal a three-peat of a multi-year trend. If it happens the way it did the last two major market cycles, this Ether prices could be primed to rise by more than Bitcoin’s during the next big monthly rally. Source: X If it turns out to be Bitcoin’s final push for its peak on this cycle as market watchers expect, Ethereum’s gains could signal the start of this cycle’s alt season in meme coins and Layer 2 app tokens. In addition to the market technical setup for ETH prices in Q3, here are four further bullish signals supporting the leading smart contract platform’s price gains in July. 1. Who Will Win Ethereum L2 Fee Wars? Ethereum’s price has taken time to absorb the shock of the Dencun upgrade on Mar. 13, 2024. The upgrade lowers rates for Layer 2 apps to lock in tranches of transaction updates with the base layer chain. In the 15 months since, developers have deployed a number of new apps with currencies that offer Ethereum services for lower fees. The base chain’s fee revenue dropped from $30 million annually to $500,000 by Q1 of this year. That saves users money, but a lot of Ethereum stakers who had their money parked in staking contracts to earn that fee revenue felt inclined to move it somewhere that it could still earn returns on their savings. This is a massive factor in Ethereum’s sluggish price growth compared to Bitcoin’s over the past year. But it’s not that the latter is falling behind its competitors like Solana and Ripple. When factoring in the growth of the post-Dencun L2 coins on Ethereum— like Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Movement (MOVE), and Starknet (STRK)— the money mostly didn’t leave Ethereum and go to its competitors. It went to another layer, powered by and supporting the base chain. For that reason, Ethereum may be undervalued by a large number of the cryptocurrency market’s headline readers that don’t understand what happened. Ethereum Identity Crisis? Some have referred in the mean time to this awkward stage in Ethereum’s growth as an identity crisis. It’s an open platform and anyone can build on it in any way that the code can handle. The question for Vitalik Buterin and crypto market investors who show up to value early is: Will one of the slew of Ethereum scale and fee apps, some new app we haven’t heard of yet, or an upgrade be what implements the best ultra long term, future proof, platform-wide standardizations that define the network’s global advantages? Find the answer to that question and you’re doing some real work. 2. SharpLink $30M ETH Buy In another positive development, the corporate treasury race that started for Bitcoin supplies continues to rock the Ethereum markets. SharpLink Gaming, bought another $30 million worth of ETH just before the Ether price chart threw a small cup and handle pattern. But why does this matter? Well, let’s see what happened to STrategy. Led by founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, Tyson’s Corner, Virginia-based Strategy Inc. and Bitcoin have both benefited from the company’s pivot in 2020 to simply pile up as much BTC as it can hold on to forever. As a result of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity with investors since then, MSTR stock rallied 566% in under 11 months from $63 per share on Jan. 5, 2024 to a price peak of $420 on Nov. 22, 2024. Over that same time, the S&P 500 Index rallied 27% from the 4697 level to 5969. Every $100 spent on Strategy stock on Jan. 5 last year could be sold for $666 dollars on Nov. 22, paying back buyers $566 for saving their $100 with MSTR shares for a term of 11 months. That’s like a downpayment on a new car lease with a high credit score. Meanwhile, $100 spent on an S&P 500 ETF would have returned buyers $27. That’s more like a cheap dinner out for two. All for the same hundred bucks and the same 11 months. That suggests regulated Wall Street investors wanted on to the Bitcoin bandwagon and found a way in Strategy stocks. Seeing the bullishness of corporate finance, Internet crypto markets were now racing Strategy to accumulate a scarce supply of BTC tokens. Now, SharpLink is doing it again with ETH. The company’s stocks spiked over 8 days in late May from $3.76 per share to just under $80 a share as Wall Street rewarded the former gaming company for pivoting to accumulating a regulated corporate Ether treasury. 3. $39M ETH Whale Bite Meanwhile, an Ethereum whale took a $39 million chomp out of the crypto dip on 6/22. Ethereum’s forward outlook was too good for this whale not to bite at that 24% off discount tag. Every token is a vote with a daily trading value that fluctuates on a global open market of crypto exchanges. Participants “vote” by locking, unlocking, moving, and swapping currencies, as often as they like, any time they like. When crypto investors take Ether tokens off a crypto exchange, the remaining supply of ETH tends to attract higher prices at the point of sale. But when they stake ETH for yield, it creates even more support. 4. Bit Digital Drops $34M BTC for ETH Not to be outdone by SharpLink, publicly traded, New York-based blockchain company Bit Digital, announced on 6/25 it is giving up $34 million worth of BTC tokens to move the proceeds into Ether and develop staking strategies. They might profit well from determining in advance of the overall market which of the Ethereum scale and fee coins will deliver the most yield and gains together over timespans relevant to their balance sheet and calendar.

2025-07-06T07:04:23,"Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya Says Continued US Dollar Decay May Not Be a Bad Thing – Here’s Why","Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya believes that a long-term decline of the US dollar is not an existential concern for America. In a new episode of the All-In podcast, host Jason Calacanis highlights that the US dollar index (DXY) witnessed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years after losing nearly 11% of its value against other major currencies in the first six months of 2025. While Calacanis describes the slump as “shocking,” Palihapitiya argues that the dollar has been in decline for decades, and it’s not a major concern because the gains from US assets have consistently outweighed the currency’s depreciation. “This has been a one-way trade for a very long time, and it’s probably important to understand why that is. And I think it generally has to do with the fact that the United States finances a lot of growth, and that has been the right decision. Unless you see a complete collapse in the currency, I suspect that this decay continues to happen. So the question is, is it a bad thing? And the answer is it depends. Because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues, you’re still ahead… If you look at asset prices in the United States relative to asset prices any place else in the world, it is the flight to quality, which is to say it is the thing that everybody wants to own. And you see that in the equity markets, you see it in real estate, you see it in hard assets… The reality is that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than they want to own other assets and those assets are dollar-denominated.” Palihipatiya also highlights that there will be a constant demand for dollar-denominated assets as long as “there’s American ingenuity and American supremacy,” which would meaningfully offset the downside of holding USD.

2025-07-06T06:32:58,"XRP Proponent Warns Bitcoin Holders: Michael Saylor Is a Government Contractor","The Bitcoin community has celebrated the digital asset’s climb past $110,000 in 2025 as evidence of its growing global relevance. Yet beneath the surface, not all voices share the optimism. Over 10,000 BTC, worth more than $1 billion, was recently moved from a wallet that had been inactive since 2011 . Following that, multiple similar wallets were activated, and a total of 80,009 BTC, worth almost $9 billion, was moved to unknown wallets. The transfers prompted speculation among many crypto holders, but Bitcoin advocates largely dismissed the event as routine. However, XRP proponent Edoardo Farina views it as a sign of deeper instability. Farina’s Warning to Bitcoin Holders In a recent post , Farina stated that the Bitcoin community is “completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face,” asserting that they are “blinded by arrogance” and unable to see the broader implications. For Farina, the timing and nature of these moves suggest something more than mere internal transfers. Though none of the funds appear to have entered centralized exchanges, the scale of the movement has unsettled some market watchers, and some anticipate an upcoming sell-off. Farina argues this is precisely the kind of event the Bitcoin community refuses to analyze critically. The BTC community is completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face. Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses. Blinded by arrogance, they unable to spot the RED flags. But in time, their fall will be the lesson. We tried to warn them. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went further in questioning the motivations of Bitcoin figureheads, alleging that Michael Saylor, who has been called Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , is part of a coordinated effort to mislead. “Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses,” Farina wrote, reinforcing a narrative he has promoted in previous critiques of institutional involvement in Bitcoin. Possibility of Future Sell-Offs The suggestion that these dormant wallets could eventually be used to liquidate large holdings is not unprecedented. Historically, early miner wallets have rarely moved funds unless some form of realization, profit-taking, transfer of custody, or structural risk management was involved. A similar event occurred in March 2024 after a wallet that had stayed dormant for 14 years sold its BTC at an all-time high. The 2025 wallet reactivations mirror those concerns. If such holders begin to exit positions during heightened optimism, Bitcoin could be exposed to swift downward pressure. Is Bitcoin’s Downfall Coming? Critics of Farina often dismiss his perspective as tribalism. However, the scale and timing of the recent wallet moves lend some weight to his concerns. Farina has always believed that Bitcoin maximalists are not ready to admit XRP’s superiority , and their blindness in this case reinforces his point. For him, the issue is the Bitcoin community’s refusal to confront the possibility of an unfavorable outcome. “Their fall will be the lesson,” he warned. “We tried to warn them.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-06T06:30:57,"Bitcoin Giants Shrink: Whales Quietly Hand Off Billions To Institutions","Bitcoin’s price has held steady around $108,100 as of Saturday afternoon after big holders shipped out a massive load of coins. Based on reports, whales—those early adopters and big miners—sold over 500,000 BTC in the past 12 months. At today’s rates, that stash is worth north of $50 billion. Institutions grabbed almost every coin they let go. It’s a huge shift in who really owns Bitcoin. Whales Pass The Torch According to Bloomberg’s review of 10x Research data, wallets holding between 1,000–10,000 BTC saw their balances slip from over 4.5 million coins in January 2023 to about 4.47 million in July 2025. At the same time, addresses with 100–1,000 BTC jumped from nearly 4 million to 4.77 million. That shift shows big players trimming back while medium‑size holders, often funds or wealthy clients, build their stacks. It’s happening quietly through in‑kind transfers and private deals that skip public exchanges. Institutions Ramp Up Their Stakes Funds, ETFs and corporate treasuries have scooped up almost every coin dropped by whales. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows private companies boosted their holdings from 279,374 BTC in July 2024 to 290,883 BTC today. Public firms climbed from 325,400 BTC to 848,600 BTC. ETFs led the charge, raising their balance from 1,039,000 BTC to 1,405,480 BTC. In total, these groups added 899,198 BTC—about $96 billion—over the past year. That buying power has helped keep the market in balance as whales step back. Shift In On-Chain Holdings Medium-sized wallets are growing while the largest ones shrink. That trend suggests new types of investors are moving in. Edward Chin, co‑founder of Parataxis Capital, said in‑kind transfers let coins move from anonymous holders to regulated firms without public trades. This quiet pipeline boosts on‑chain activity and brings more oversight to big Bitcoin trades. Volatility Hits Two-Year Low As institutional flows rise, price swings have dulled. The Deribit 30‑day volatility gauge sits at its lowest level in two years. Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca, compared today’s Bitcoin to a steady dividend payer that might deliver annual gains in the 10–20% range. That’s a far cry from the 1,400% surge seen in 2017. For long‑term savers, steadier returns look more attractive than wild rallies. Meanwhile, Fred Thiel, CEO of miner MARA Holdings, said his company still holds every coin it mines. But he warned that if whale selling picks up again and institutional appetite fades, prices could lurch lower.

2025-07-06T06:30:06,"DOGE Bulls Hold The Line At $0.15 — Is The Rally Still Alive?","Dogecoin (DOGE) prices have crashed by over 4% in the past month indicating a slightly dominant bearish influence in recent weeks. Similar to the crypto market leader (Bitcoin), the prominent altcoin and memecoin has registered significant market corrections since attaining a local peak of $0.249 on May 22. However, recent revelations by top analyst Ali Martinez has shown a bullish market condition that supports a price rebound for the DOGE market. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins DOGE Bulls Eye Return To $0.22 In an X post on July 5, Martinez provides some technical insights into the DOGE market highlighting an important requisite for the altcoin to rediscover its bullish form. Using the daily trading DOGEUSDT chart, the renowned analyst identifies an ascending trendline that stretches to 2023. At multiple instances of a retest, this trendline has acted as an efficient support consistently rejecting a further price decline. According to Martinez’s analysis, Dogecoin is trading around this trendline which presently runs through the $0.150 price level. The analyst explains market bulls must defend this price zone which not only fuels the chances of a price rebound, but essentially prevents a breakdown and complete transition to a bearish market. Interestingly, all retest of the highlighted trendline has always produced a price bounce resulting in a parabolic rally. This event is seen in price surges of $0.059 to $0.210 (≈255% gain) between 2023-2024, and $0.095 to $0.470 (≈395%) in 2024. However, Ali Martinez presents a conservative price target, stating a defence of $0.15 support level supports a quick bullish return to at least $0.220. Nevertheless, in the presence of a strong bullish pressure as seen in previous rallies, DOGE investors may expect a further rise to around $0.24 with a potential to return to the local market peak of $0.47. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.164 reflecting a modest price gain of 0.91% and 0.56% on the daily chart and weekly chart, respectively. Meanwhile, the memecoin has recorded a 56.81% crash in its daily trading volume indicating a significant fall in market interest. According to data from price prediction site Coincodex, general sentiment in the DOGE market is bearish. However, investors retain an healthy market demand as evidenced by a Fear & Greed Index of 67 i.e. significant amount of greed. For the short-term, Coincodex analysts expects DOGE to still maintain a price around $0.160 in the next five days while projecting a price gain to $0.193 in a month. Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts show little expected price growth in the far future as indicated by price targets of $0.197 in three months, and $0.169 in six months.

Currently, the price is consolidating just under a major resistance trendline on the daily chart. This level has held firm for several days, creating tension in the market as traders await the next decisive move. Interestingly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that back in 2020, a huge government spending bill helped send Bitcoin to record highs. Now in 2025, another spending bill is on the way, and this one is even bigger, hoping that history might repeat itself. In a recent interview, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared his outlook for Bitcoin’s price over the next two to three months. According to Moreno, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $87,000 and $99,000 in the short term if current market conditions continue. Moreno explained that this range is based on on-chain data showing the average price at which traders brought their Bitcoin, known as the realized price. In bull markets, prices often correct toward this level before moving higher again. The upper resistance band, which would act as a potential top for now, sits at $138,000. Right now, demand for Bitcoin appears to be weakening slightly. Unless buying activity picks up in the coming weeks, Moreno said there’s a stronger chance of seeing a dip toward $99,000 before any major rally. He said that in order to see Bitcoin climb to $138,000, demand would need to strengthen. Moreno further explained that Bitcoin’s market cycle top could still reach around $190,000 later on, though he expects the current cycle to stretch into 2026. Historically, Bitcoin performs well in the final quarter of the year during bull cycles, so a strong finish to 2025 isn’t off the table.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-could-test-99k-before-a-year-end-surge-say-market-experts/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|RESEARCH","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-07-06T05:00:44,"Ethereum Wyckoff Accumulation Hints At Explosive Q3 – $4K Level In Sight","Ethereum is trading just above the $2,500 mark following days of volatility, choppy price action, and uncertainty across crypto markets. Despite the hesitation, bulls have held critical support, and the coming days are shaping up to be a defining moment for Ethereum and the broader altcoin space. Momentum is slowly shifting as investors look for confirmation that ETH will lead the next wave of upside action. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that a Wyckoff accumulation pattern is currently unfolding. According to Pillows, this structure resembles the early stages of major breakouts seen in past cycles and signals strong smart money positioning. He argues that Ethereum already played a key role in Bitcoin’s latest rally to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to shine. A sustained breakout above the $2,600–$2,700 range could trigger the next phase of the cycle, with $3,000 in sight as the initial target. With market sentiment recovering and BTC consolidating near highs, traders and investors are closely watching Ethereum’s next move to gauge whether an altseason is around the corner. The setup is in place — but ETH must deliver. Ethereum Builds Strength Ethereum is up 82% from its April lows, demonstrating strong bullish control as the price holds firmly above key demand zones. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700, a structure that has persisted since early May. This tight consolidation suggests the market is preparing for a decisive breakout, one that could define Ethereum’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Ted Pillows reveals that Ethereum is now undergoing a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern. According to his analysis, this phase marks the transfer of ETH from weak hands to strong hands, and it mirrors past cycle setups that led to explosive rallies. Pillows argues that Ethereum helped push Bitcoin to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to take the spotlight. If this pattern plays out, Pillows sees a clear path: first a breakout to $3,000, followed by a healthy correction, and then a push to $4,000 sometime in Q3. Beyond that, the real parabolic move may begin, driven by renewed confidence, broader altcoin participation, and sustained demand for ETH as a core asset in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH Holds Above Key Support Amid Tight Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,520, maintaining its position above critical support levels despite recent volatility. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has acknowledged the $2,480–$2,500 zone multiple times since late May, signaling strong buyer interest at these levels. The price remains trapped within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, with no clear breakout yet in either direction. ETH is currently trading near its 50- and 100-period SMAs, which are converging around the current price, indicating equilibrium and a potential inflection point. The 200-period SMA sits below $2,200 and continues to trend upward, supporting the longer-term bullish structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range Volume has remained relatively stable, with no spike suggesting institutional accumulation or mass distribution. For bulls to regain full momentum, ETH must reclaim the $2,600–$2,700 resistance and flip it into support. On the downside, a clean break below $2,480 could expose the $2,300 zone once again.

As 2025 progresses, some projects are getting attention for their strong purpose, structured plans, and active communities. This article highlights four networks with different focuses, like mining systems, wallet utilities, Solana trading tools, and Bitcoin-based rewards. While each one has its unique approach, all share good upside potential during their current presale phases. Here are the top crypto presale projects in 2025 you should know about today, starting with BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG: GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Brings Special Pricing Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG’s presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11th. It has sold over 23.5 billion coins and raised $331.5 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The listing price is set at $0.05, opening the chance for over 3,000% returns when listed. There will be 45 batches or until it hits its $600 million funding target. This method builds strong infrastructure and market readiness before launch. BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG setup that supports fast processing with better energy efficiency. Its X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Hardware miners X30 and X100 will ship on July 7, and X10 on August 15. Security checks by CertiK and Halborn add to its credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing with real DeFi uses, an active system, and a six-week global plan, making it one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 with strong basics and early access advantages. BEST Wallet: A Multi-Use Wallet with Built-In Utility BEST Wallet offers a non-custodial wallet that works as a launchpad and staking platform. Its $BEST coin presale has raised over $13.5 million at a current price of $0.0252. From its 10 billion total coins, only 4.5% are in presale, spread across 100 small pricing stages. It offers swaps, bridges, staking, NFTs, and governance straight from its interface. Owning $BEST offers fee discounts, exclusive staking APYs above 105%, and access to future presales via the app. Security is boosted with Fireblocks MPC. Soon, NFT support and derivatives will launch. BEST Wallet is becoming a place for DeFi and presale activity, placing it among the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for those seeking wallet benefits and passive income options. Snorter: Telegram-Based Solana Trading Bot Snorter is built for Solana and gives fast, low-cost Telegram trading features. It combines sniping, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and copy-trading in one platform. Its standout feature is that it works directly within Telegram, letting users place trades quickly using simple chat commands. The presale is live, and pricing changes with demand via its portal. More than a bot, Snorter is building an entire system for the new Telegram trading era. As Solana bots grow, Snorter gives a timing and safety advantage. MEV protection and honeypot scanning help reduce risks often linked with fast sniping. This makes Snorter one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for users aiming to automate and improve their Solana trading strategies. BTC Bull: Coin Rewards Linked to Bitcoin Growth BTC Bull is a rewards coin that tracks Bitcoin’s market rise without needing to hold BTC itself. It uses custom smart contracts and DeFi staking layers to let users earn from BTC movements. The presale starts at around $0.001 with a burn system to keep the supply limited. Each presale stage has limited allocations to avoid sudden price drops. BTC Bull stands out for its rewards based on Bitcoin’s price. Users who stake early can earn higher APYs when BTC’s value goes up. Future plans include listings, BTC-pegged liquidity vaults, and rewards tied to Bitcoin dominance. With Bitcoin aiming beyond $60,000, BTC Bull gives a way to gain from this growth trend through structured incentives, making it a strong candidate in the top crypto presale projects in 2025 list. Final Remarks! BlockDAG offers an entry at just $0.0016 with early buyers seeing 2,660% gains so far, BEST Wallet combines wallet services with staking and launchpad utility, Snorter delivers Solana trading tools on Telegram, and BTC Bull lets users benefit from BTC price rises through its reward system. These top crypto presale projects in 2025 each bring their own features, from real usage to smart passive rewards. Picking the right one depends on your goals, but these projects are already building strong trust and practical use cases before their exchange listings.

2025-07-06T02:39:57,"Bitcoin Reserves Won’t Secure America’s Future, But Building a Financial Platform Will","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserves Won’t Secure America’s Future, But Building a Financial Platform Will When former President Donald Trump proposed creating a U.S. sovereign wealth fund with Bitcoin included as part of the country’s strategic reserves, the idea stirred up headlines and heated debate. At first glance, it might seem bold, even forward-thinking, for the United States to invest heavily in Bitcoin. But if we really care about long-term financial leadership, Americans should look beyond just buying digital assets. The smarter strategy lies in creating a national platform that integrates blockchain technology into our financial system. The U.S. holds a privileged place in the world economy. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, we benefit from widespread trust in our economy, our government, and our ability to maintain financial stability. That trust gives us enormous influence around the world. But maintaining that position requires forward-thinking action, not just investing in trendy assets. The Flaws in Relying on Bitcoin Reserves Many argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and resistance to manipulation make it a perfect candidate for national reserves. Since it is not controlled by any government, Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold, a supposedly safe and neutral asset in times of global uncertainty. But while that may sound good in theory, it doesn’t serve the practical needs of a national reserve. Strategic reserves are designed for emergencies, to settle international debts, support the economy in times of disruption, and ensure financial continuity. Bitcoin’s price volatility and limited real-world usage make it a poor fit for such purposes today. Worse yet, if the U.S. were to begin hoarding Bitcoin, the move might be interpreted as a lack of confidence in our own currency. That could undermine global trust in the dollar and open the door for geopolitical rivals, such as China or Russia, to challenge America’s financial credibility. Simply put, trying to “future-proof” the economy by holding Bitcoin could actually weaken our position in the short term. While it’s true that Bitcoin could evolve into a global settlement tool, that evolution is still underway. What’s needed now is not stockpiling crypto, but building the rails that allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to become functional parts of the financial system. Why Building a Platform Is a Better Strategy To really lead in the digital finance age, the U.S. must do more than own assets, we need to build the infrastructure others rely on. Think back to the early days of the internet. The winners weren’t those who simply bought up websites; it was the companies that built powerful platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, that shaped the digital economy. The same principle applies today. America should invest in becoming the premier hub for digital assets by creating trustworthy exchanges, safe custodial services, and streamlined on- and off-ramps for crypto. In doing so, we export American values like the rule of law, financial transparency, and technological innovation into the growing digital economy. Bitcoin might be the starting point, but it won’t be the end. As decentralized finance (DeFi) matures, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead in developing not just the tools, but the rules that define how digital assets operate globally. Real-World Applications Already Taking Root You don’t have to be an economist to see how digital finance is changing daily life. Currently, millions of Americans are utilizing cryptocurrency for more than just trading; they’re applying it to entertainment, investing, and even gaming. For example, the rise of online casinos in the U.S. highlights how fast digital transactions are being adopted. Many platforms now accept cryptocurrencies, allowing players to deposit and withdraw instantly with lower fees and more privacy. Still, while regulations vary by state, the demand for digital-first entertainment shows just how far the financial landscape has shifted. This isn’t a far-off future, it’s already happening, and it’s one more reason we need to lead with infrastructure, not speculation. The Power of Stablecoins Backed by the Dollar One of the biggest opportunities for strengthening America’s global financial role lies in the expansion of dollar-based stablecoins. These are digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering the stability of our national currency with the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology. Used wisely, stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more inclusive cross-border payments. They can provide people around the world with access to digital dollars without requiring a U.S. bank account. If properly regulated and with clear rules around reserves, consumer protection, and transparency, stablecoins could extend the reach of the dollar more effectively than traditional banks or foreign policy ever could. Of course, not all countries welcome dollarization, and in regions where local currencies are weak or politically sensitive, dollar-pegged stablecoins may face resistance. That’s where Bitcoin and other decentralized assets can act as neutral alternatives, bridging systems without being tied to any one nation. Sparking American Innovation Through Smart Policy The U.S. didn’t build the internet by micromanaging innovation. Instead, we laid the legal and technical groundwork for entrepreneurs to experiment and scale. That’s how Silicon Valley became the envy of the world. We can take a similar approach now by giving U.S. companies the space to build on top of open financial networks whether that’s blockchain, stablecoins, or other emerging tech. A balance between regulation and freedom is critical. With too much red tape, we risk losing talent and capital to friendlier markets. With too little oversight, we undermine trust. If we get the balance right, we can lead again, offering an open alternative to closed, authoritarian systems like central bank digital currencies being developed in places like China. Those systems may be efficient, but they don’t align with the open values America is known for.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside.

2025-07-06T00:30:52,"US Secret Service unmasks $400M crypto scam network","Over the past decade, the US Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has quietly recovered nearly $400 million in digital assets from cybercriminals, emerging as a formidable force in global crypto enforcement. What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

The 4-hour structure remains within an ascending support line, but momentum indicators show signs of exhaustion. Bulls face strong resistance at $110,500, while short-term supports have formed near $107,200. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The current Bitcoin price action is testing a key ascending trendline that originates from the June 23 low. Price has stalled near $108,000 after rejecting the $110,800–$111,000 supply zone, where multiple failed breakouts occurred. The Supertrend indicator remains bullish above $106,997, and the rising trendline is intact. However, the DMI shows weakening strength in both +DI and -DI, with ADX sliding, suggesting reduced trend momentum. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The 4-hour Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating reduced volatility. Price is currently riding the mid-band near $108,600. A breakout beyond the upper band ($110,600) or a break below $107,000 will likely define the next directional move.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

2025-07-05T23:30:39,"Here’s How High XRP Could Rise If Bitcoin Hits $1M","The possibility of Bitcoin reaching a $1 million valuation has gained considerable attention from industry leaders and financial analysts. As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Surpass This Estimate Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million? While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.
