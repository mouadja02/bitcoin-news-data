2025-07-06T20:10:00,"Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Cap to Strengthen Ethereum Security and Stability","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward a new proposal, EIP-7983, which tries to cap the gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units. The proposal is proposed to make Ethereum more robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, increase stability, and enable higher compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Why Ethereum Needs a Gas Cap With Ethereum’s current configuration, one transaction may exhaust the entire block’s gas limit. This makes it a vulnerability wherein one high-demand transaction can jeopardize the network by tying up resources, raising DoS vulnerability and uncertainty. The proposed EIP-7983 attempts to do this by setting a hard cap of 16.77 million gas (2²⁴) per transaction. “By doing so, Ethereum can raise its resistance to some DoS vectors,” the proposal states. Impact on zkVMs and Network Efficiency The proposed limit is not just a security issue—it’s an issue of licensing as well. EIP-7983 will contribute to increasing Ethereum’s compatibility with zkVMs by encouraging developers to split large transactions into small, manageable transactions. Transactions requesting gas over the 16.77 million limit would be rejected at the block validation level so they would never even get onto the network. This measure operates independently of the block-level gas maximum, which remains variable at the hands of validators. Balancing Innovation and Security Buterin and Wahrstätter point out that 16.77 million is a conscious choice of a limit that can serve most current decentralized finance (DeFi) and contract deployment applications with the additional aim of reducing unnecessary risk. While not backward compatible for addresses above the cap, the vast majority of existing Ethereum transactions are already below the threshold, avoiding excessive disruption. EIP-7983 is the culmination of earlier work like EIP-7825, aiming to make Ethereum handling of transactions more predictable and friendlier to users. Simplifying Ethereum’s Future This concept is one of Buterin’s larger plans to simplify Ethereum. In May, he argued in favor of a simplified protocol on the lines of Bitcoin’s minimalism to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use. His five-year plan involves simplifying Ethereum’s execution, consensus, and shared pieces. Alongside, Buterin is exploring new ideas such as “pluralistic identity,” a digital identity system that strives to maintain privacy while enabling equal online engagement.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-strengthen-ethereum/,"ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Ethereum|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T20:00:46,"Company Owned by Billionaire Gold Miner May Be Seized by Russian Government for Allegedly Breaching Regulations: Report","The Russian government is attempting to seize a gold mining firm owned by a billionaire accused of breaking a rule that bans public officials from engaging in entrepreneurial activity. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit to seize shares of billionaire Konstantin Strukov’s gold mining company, Yuzhuralzoloto, state-owned media Tass reports . Strukov, who has been a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Chelyabinsk Region for 25 years, while also the deputy chairman of the Legislative Assembly, acquired the firm through a bankruptcy procedure. He was also the company’s CEO between 1997 and June 2001 before he became chairman of the board of directors. The government’s lawsuit alleges that Strukov violated a ban on all public officials from engaging in business activity. The rule also requires politicians to sell all their securities, shares, or stakes in companies before taking office. According to Tass, Yuzhuralzoloto produces over 450,000 ounces of gold per year, which is $1.505 billion annually with a profit of 34 billion rubles – $432.43 million. Prosecutors allege that Strukov frequently takes profits from the mine and transfers them abroad to Montenegro, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Latvia, Estonia and Turkey where he and his family purchased houses, yachts and other luxury items. The Russian government is requesting that 100% of Strukov and his daughter’s ownership of the company be transferred to the state.

2025-07-06T20:00:00,"Sextortion and $400m in Bitcoin: Inside the Secret Service’s crypto war","Now armed with blockchain forensics instead of briefcases of cash, the U.S. Secret Service is quietly becoming one of the most sophisticated crypto crime-fighting units in the world. According to Bloomberg , its Global Investigative Operations Center has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets—stored in a single cold wallet—through operations targeting scams, fraud, and extortion. One recent case illustrates the agency’s evolving reach: after a teenager was sextorted for $600, agents traced the crypto through a money mule to a Nigerian national allegedly responsible for thousands of illicit transactions. The agency, led by investigative analyst Jamie Lam, specializes in digital financial crimes using software, subpoenas, and spreadsheets rather than traditional law enforcement tools. The team traces cryptocurrency fraud through domain registrations, wallet connections, and blockchain analysis.

Older victims suffered the largest losses at nearly $2.8 billion, primarily through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Kali Smith, who directs the agency’s cryptocurrency strategy, has conducted training workshops in over 60 countries to help local law enforcement unmask digital crimes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said during a recent Bermuda training session. Recent cases show the agency’s investigative capabilities. An Idaho teenager received sextortion demands after sending inappropriate photos online, paying $600 before contacting police. Secret Service analysts traced payments through an American money mule to a Nigerian passport holder who had processed $4.1 million across nearly 6,000 transactions. British authorities arrested the suspected extortionist upon landing in England, where he awaits extradition. The case involved reconstructing the crime through screenshots, receipts, and blockchain data analysis. It also underscores how digital sleuthing is redefining modern law enforcement—and how online exploitation has become a billion-dollar crimes. The Secret Service collaborates with cryptocurrency companies for trace analysis and wallet freezes. Coinbase and Tether have publicly acknowledged assisting investigations, with one recovery involving $225 million in USDT linked to romance-investment scams. “We’ve been following the money for 160 years,” said Patrick Freaney, head of the agency’s New York field office. “This training is part of that mission.” Read more: NFT sales jump 10% to $136.5m, CryptoPunks shows 26% pop",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/sextortion-and-400m-in-bitcoin-inside-the-secret-services-crypto-war/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","News|Blockchain|Crime",cryptocompare

According to Arkham’s analysis, the Bitcoin whale in question is moving its assets from the traditional “1-” address format to the more modern and secure Bech32 address format, which starts with “bc1q-.” This is thought to provide increased security, lower transaction fees, and long-term storage for Bitcoin users. Analysts explained the situation as follows: “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were most likely related to address format upgrades. There is a shift from 1- addresses to bc1q- addresses. There is no indication that the whale is selling.” Related News: Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened Address formats have changed over time on the Bitcoin network: Addresses starting with “1-” (P2PKH): Bitcoin's first address format. Although shorter and more widely used, it does not support SegWit (Segregated Witness), which leads to higher transaction fees. Addresses starting with “3-” (P2SH): Provides multi-signature (multisig) and SegWit compatibility, but still does not offer full throughput. Addresses starting with “bc1q-” (Bech32 format): The latest format that supports full SegWit features.

In a press release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois says that former Tempo Bank senior loan officer Francis Eversman and construction company owner Gregg Crawford pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in a scheme that spanned between 2011 and 2020. Prosecutors say that Crawford recruited straw purchasers to serve as loan applicants in name only for properties that were often extremely overvalued. His brother-in-law, Eversman, would facilitate the approval process of the loans. Crawford used the proceeds of the loans for purposes other than the purchase of the properties. He also provided fake lease agreements in an effort to show rental income from the properties in question. When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became suspicious of the loans during an audit, Crawford told a straw purchaser to provide the regulator with fraudulent information. FBI Springfield Assistant Special Agent in Charge Karen Marinos says the duo violated the people’s trust by carrying out self-serving schemes to increase their wealth. “Every American citizen deserves to walk into their bank and trust the people behind the counter. In southern Illinois, these people are usually our neighbors and friends, people that we trust with our money and wellbeing. “ Eversman and Crawford will be sentenced on October 14th.

2025-07-06T18:30:56,"Ethereum Reserves On Binance Hits 2023 Level — What Happened Last Time?","After a dismal outing in the first quarter of 2025, the price of Ethereum put up a strong resurgent performance in the subsequent three months. While its price has somewhat slowed in recent weeks, the acclaimed “king of altcoins” is in a much better position than it was three months ago. However, Ethereum’s recently found position seems to be at risk, according to the latest on-chain revelation. Recent data shows that ETH investors seem to be moving their tokens away from long-term storage and rather onto centralized trading platforms. Bullish Perspective On Rising ETH Reserves On Binance In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst BorisVest shared that the Ethereum reserves on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, have been swelling over the past few weeks. According to the crypto pundit, the exchange now holds over 4% of ETH’s total circulating supply. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the Ethereum reserves on Binance have not risen to this level since May 2023. Typically, the flow of ETH tokens to centralized exchanges — which usually offer trading services — suggests that the assets are being positioned to be offloaded or sold into the open market. Hence, the recent surge in the Ethereum reserves on Binance is a bearish signal for the price of ETH, as it signals impending selling pressure. This means that this trend could exacerbate an ongoing price correction or trigger the beginning of downward price movement . However, BorisVest also painted a bullish picture for the Ethereum price based on this on-chain observation. “If these ETH transfers are being positioned ahead of a potential rally, and price holds firm despite increasing reserves, it could indicate strong underlying demand or strategic positioning by whales,” the analyst said. Furthermore, BorisVest mentioned that the last time the Ethereum reserves on Binance rose to this level, the price of ETH dropped from $1,900 to around $1,600. However, this brief price correction was followed by a sharp, abrupt rally to the upside. The on-chain analyst also noted that the ETH price has not witnessed any major downward movement since the Binance reserves started rising, suggesting price resilience by the altcoin. Ultimately, BorisVest urged investors to stay alert as these recent exchange movements could trigger the next move for the Ethereum price .

After a period of slowed momentum, digital collectibles have rebounded with a 10.44% increase in total sales volume, reaching $136.5 million. This marks the second straight week of growth for the sector, signaling renewed interest among traders and collectors. Strong Crypto Prices Support NFT Growth The rise in NFT sales is coinciding with the broader crypto market’s upward trend. Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed to $108,000, while Ethereum (ETH) has also gained 3.6% over the past week. The global crypto market cap is now $3.33 trillion, higher than last week’s $3.21 trillion. This growth in top crypto assets is revitalizing the NFT sector, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers. Although the sales volume has increased, the number of NFT transactions has dropped by nearly 20%. However, the number of buyers stayed the same, and the number of sellers increased by 8.09%. This means that fewer trades are occurring, but the trades that do take place are larger in value. Immutable Leads as Polygon Gains Ground Among all blockchains, Immutable remains the leader in NFT sales. It generated $43.9 million this week, representing a 30% increase from the previous week. Its growth continues to be helped by popular gaming collections. The platform also has very low wash trading, meaning most of the activity is real and organic. Polygon, now known as POL (formerly MATIC), moved into second place with $25 million in sales. That is a 51.53% increase from last week. However, Polygon’s wash trading rose sharply, reaching over $564,000. Ethereum blockchain dropped to third place with $22.5 million in NFT sales, a 8.63% decrease. Wash trading on Ethereum also increased slightly. Still, the Ethereum network remains one of the most used blockchains in the NFT space. Other blockchains, such as Mythos, BNB Chain, and Bitcoin, also remained active. Mythos experienced a slight increase in sales, while BNB saw a corresponding drop. The Bitcoin network reached $8.7 million in sales, representing over 12% growth. In terms of buyers, Polygon saw the highest increase, followed by Bitcoin and Mythos. Gaming NFTs are also gaining ground, with top collections like Guild of Guardians Heroes and The Courtyard seeing strong sales growth. CryptoPunks Reclaim the Spotlight CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most well-known NFT collections , is rising again. It climbed to ninth place with $2 million in sales, and the collection has seen improvements in both activity and user interest. Some CryptoPunks were sold for very high prices. One Punk sold for 150 ETH, equivalent to approximately $389,000. Others sold for between $150,000 and $200,000. This shows that collectors are still willing to pay large amounts for rare NFTs.

2025-07-06T17:00:57,"Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High?","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has not been particularly impressive over the weekend, which has been a somewhat consistent theme of the cryptocurrency market so far in the year 2025. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin’s indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (>1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (<1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin’s long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. “BTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,” the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-06T16:55:34,"Drake Drops New Single Comparing ‘Fake Friends’ to Bitcoin’s Brutal Price Swings","Drake, a renowned rapper and Bitcoin enthusiast, has dropped a new single ahead of an album release with lyrics referring to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The single is released at a time when Bitcoin’s future remains uncertain, particularly regarding regulatory support from the US government. It could very well reach an All-Time High (ATH) in the coming months. Drake’s new single addressed themes of betrayal, fake friends, and conflict. Drake released a new single titled “What did I miss” ahead of an upcoming album release. Bitcoin traders have taken a keen interest in the album due to its lyrics—the new single references Drake’s ongoing feud with rapper Kendrick Lamar. Drake refers to his conflict with Lamar as being similar to the price volatility of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate significantly from one day to the next. Drake is also a keen gambler and has been referred to as the ‘Drake Curse’ due to his unfortunate picks on UFC, NBA, among other high-profile sporting events. Blockwave, a Bitcoin hardware provider, predicted in 2022 that it would use data from previous innovations that scaled over time, such as automobiles, electricity, and the internet, to forecast Bitcoin adoption. Blockwave predicted that Bitcoin would hit 10% adoption by 2030, using the listed scalability models for technological innovation. It is estimated that Bitcoin currently has a global adoption rate of 4%, meaning that approximately 4% of the world’s population holds Bitcoin. Therefore, using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, we can safely assume that Bitcoin will double from 4% to 10%, which corresponds to a roughly 2x increase in adoption. This could lead to a 2x price increase from $100k to $200k if the scalability model of technological innovation holds. This forecast supports the Bitcoin traders who have been pointing to a $200,000 price target. Drake’s reference to Bitcoin’s volatility may be timely if the price continues to make large returns for crypto traders. Drake released the new single during a YouTube stream titled “ICEMAN EPISODE ONE,” where the Canadian rapper addressed the issue of betrayal and feuds. In the stream, Drake plays the character of a worker on his lunch break. The song is about a friend who has betrayed his trust. He describes this as being similar to the price of Bitcoin, which sometimes serves as an ally when the price rises, but then becomes a traitor when the price falls, leaving Drake with less money. He could be describing his relationships as being similar to gambling, with one moment being on top, and then being betrayed when he is down on his luck. His lyrics describe friends who once stood by his side and now hang out with people who are his enemies. He describes friendship like the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate without warning. Bitcoin has been a complicated asset to forecast, changing direction within the blink of an eye and causing much suffering for traders who speculate on margin. The ‘Drake Curse’ refers to the rapper’s history of taking large bets on the NBA and UFC. Drake has lost over $1 million in Bitcoin, betting on NBA games. Drake took a bet on the Dallas Mavericks taking the NBA title. He lost his $ 500,000 Bitcoin bet because the Boston Celtics beat the Mavericks. Within weeks of this failed bet, Drake bet another $500k on the Edmonton Oilers winning the NHL Cup. However, the Panthers beat the Oilers, adding another Loss to Drake’s gambling tally. Maybe Drake could release his gambling blockchain that gives all proceeds to a ‘0% admin fees’ charity such as GiveDirectly? This would transform Drake’s gambling losses into charity donations. The more he loses, the more he gives. The UFC has been of great interest to the Canadian rapper. His most notable loss was betting $450,000 on Israel Adesanya to defeat Dricus du Plessis in 2024. However, he has had some notable successes, such as betting on Alexander Volkanovski to beat Diego Lopes. This was a good bet because Volkanovski had experienced some major losses and appeared to be on the verge of retirement. However, recently, Drake bet on Oliveira beating Topuria, which cost him $ 200,000. Topuria achieved a knock-out in the first round, which would have been very disappointing for Drake to watch. Drake, therefore, has a lot of experience with Bitcoin and gambling, earning the title ‘Drake Curse’. The reference to Bitcoin in his latest song is a reflection of how cryptocurrencies have become a mainstream phenomenon, no longer a fringe movement.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/drake-drops-new-single-comparing-fake-friends-to-bitcoins-brutal-price-swings/,"BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:55:24,"Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‘Jubilant July,’ Says Altcoins Will Likely ‘Cook’ for Next Few Weeks","A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin ( BTC ) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

2025-07-06T16:55:00,"Top 3 catalysts for Bitcoin and altcoins this week","Bitcoin and most altcoins remained in a tight range last week, despite rising exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and top US indices, such as the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, reaching a record high. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above $110,000 for the first time in a month and then pared back those gains, ending the week at $108,000. The market capitalization of all coins ended the week at $3.30 trillion. Here are some of the top catalysts for Bitcoin and most altcoins. Tariff deadline The most important catalyst for the stock and crypto markets will be the end of President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs, slated for July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with a few countries, including Vietnam, China, and the U.K. Other top trading partners — Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea — may revert to the high tariffs he announced in April. A restart of his “retaliatory tariffs” will likely be bearish for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market. For example, Bitcoin price plunged to $74,000 after the Liberation Day speech , and then bounced back after he announced the 90-day pause. You might also like: XLM price at risk as Stellar Lumens’ funding rate crashes FOMC minutes Bitcoin and altcoins are also expected to react to the Federal Open Market Committee minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. These minutes, for the May 6-7, 2025 meeting, will provide more information about the last meeting, in which officials left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed minutes will provide hints on when officials expect to cut interest rates, which would be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. Still, the odds of a rate cut in July have decreased recently due to the strong nonfarm payrolls data. The data showed that the economy added over 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%. Most traders anticipate the bank to cut rates in September if inflation data continues falling. Bitcoin price potential breakout The other key catalyst for Bitcoin and the crypto market will be the potential BTC breakout. The chart below shows that Bitcoin has remained below the all-time high of $111,900 in the past few weeks. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern, shown in black, and a cup-and-handle pattern. These two patterns often result in greater gains over time. Therefore, a breakout this week could push it to its all-time high, leading to further gains among altcoins. The other top catalysts in the crypto market include upcoming token unlocks by prominent altcoins such as Aptos ( APT ), Flare ( FLR ), and Ethereum Name Service.

2025-07-06T16:51:39,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Altcoins Could Break Out as as U.S. Prepares for Historic Crypto Week","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Altcoins Could Break Out as as U.S. Prepares for Historic Crypto Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has been unusually quiet lately, but that calm might not last much longer. A big event is on the horizon that could shake up Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. The U.S. Congress is preparing for “Crypto Week” from July 14 to 18, and the decisions made during this week could have a major impact on the crypto market. What’s Happening in the Market Right Now? In the past week, the price of Bitcoin and altcoins has barely moved. Bitcoin is up just 0.6%, Ethereum by 2%, and most of the altcoin market has stayed flat. Some meme coins managed double-digit gains, but overall, it’s been a slow, sideways market. Historically, this kind of price action often happens before a big breakout, and all attention is now on what Congress will decide in the coming days. Why Crypto Week Matters During Crypto Week, U.S. lawmakers will discuss and possibly pass several important bills related to cryptocurrency: The Clarity Act: This bill will finally create clear rules for how crypto assets are traded, invested, and regulated in the U.S. The Stablecoin Bill (Genius Act): Focused on regulating dollar-backed stablecoins, it has already passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House as well. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: A bill aimed at blocking government-controlled digital currencies that could invade financial privacy. While some bills, like the Stablecoin Act, are likely to move quickly, others like the Clarity Act, which deals with more complex areas like DeFi, staking, and crypto taxes, might take longer to finalize. Why This Could Trigger a Market Pump Alongside these bills, the U.S. government recently approved a massive $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. This move means more money could flood the financial system, which historically tends to benefit risk assets like crypto. Plus, crypto-friendly policies and clear rules can attract new institutional investors and bringing fresh capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Ethereum’s Big Moment Is Coming While Bitcoin has been surging for months, analysts say Ethereum is about to get its turn. Big names like Bitwise predict that Ethereum ETFs and tokenized assets built on the Ethereum network could see massive growth in the second half of 2025. New projects like Robinhood’s blockchain network and the rise of tokenized stocks and stablecoins on Ethereum’s platform are expected to fuel demand for ETH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-and-altcoins-could-break-out-as-as-u-s-prepares-for-historic-crypto-week/,"ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:30:17,"This technological phenomenon is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin","The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there’s another answer. Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. Let’s be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren’t included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap. Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there’s a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. Quantum computing isn’t the Bitcoin killer Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton’s laws can’t fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc. Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power. But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins? Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer . All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent. P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won’t be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them. The technological phenomenon that could catalyze Bitcoin’s demise NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It’s considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second. According to a YouGov poll , around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict , along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years. If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” In such a scenario, one would not be wrong to assume that Bitcoin was not spared.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-will-die-technological-phenomenon/,"BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MINING","OP-ED|Bitcoin|BTC|USD",cryptocompare

Recent market fluctuations have generated a lot of fearful controversy whether the bull cycle has topped out or not. While some institutional investors are still holding strong with optimism of one last leg up, many traders are pessimistic as they panic for a potential price crash. As a matter of fact, the overall market is technically reaching an extremely overbought condition as several meme coins enter a mini bearish phase since the start of the year. Although Bonk and Pengu have regained momentum and continued to show strength amid the latest market drops. Few Meme Coins Defying Market Odds Aside from Bonk and Pengu, which have consistently charted major gains for a week, many meme coins are seriously bleeding out today as Bitcoin loses footings again after almost retesting its recently marked all-time high (ATH). Other meme coins that follow trends are Fartcoin, Useless Coin and AI Agents. Moderate gains from Turbo, Pepe and Shiba have also put their prices in a green zone over the past hours, although they may record losses if Bitcoin’s price continues to drop. Few Binance Alpha tokens, and most especially assets on Dex are not left behind in the daily posting gain as they registered a significant profit at the time of writing. What To Expect With The Current Market Behaviour The fate of the entire market lies in Bitcoin’s future direction. However, if BTC calms or even resumes bullish, the meme coin market may see a strong recovery with Doge and others rising back above their key monthly high. Otherwise, a huge breakdown can be expected in the long term. Further drops in the flagship asset could lead to a serious decline of meme coins in the future with Pengu and Bonk joining the ride. But as of now, they appear to be footing a new bullish phase. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-06T16:08:30,"Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Rise as Bessent Hints at Trade Deals Before Liberation Day Tariff Deadline","Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin (DOGE) rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. ""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. ""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/06/btc-doge-xrp-rise-as-bessent-hints-at-trade-deals-before-liberation-day-tariff-deadline,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:06:52,"Bitcoin bulls price in new all-time highs in H2 2025, with big money breakout on the horizon","Bitcoin is staring down the second half of 2025 with a clear target: new all-time highs. According to CNBC, large firms have already begun piling more of the crypto onto their balance sheets while Capitol Hill inches closer to passing long-delayed legislation. The price climbed about 30% in Q2, even though most traders called it a consolidation phase. The reason? Monthly returns kept fading, and the coin barely moved from its tight range for most of the quarter. But that didn’t stop it from racking up a 15% gain in H1, even if that’s weaker than the 45% jump during the same period last year. Still, Bitcoin’s staying power above $100,000 since May 9 is keeping bulls aggressive. The coin traded at $108,000 on Sunday, about 3% short of its May record at $111,999, per CoinGecko data . Devin Ryan, who heads financial tech research at Citizens, said, “There’s still an acceleration coming here around ETF adoption… there’s more money coming into those.” Ryan said people are still moving from owning nothing to owning some, adding that the old walls around Bitcoin access are disappearing. “We’re moving closer to the end of the consolidation,” he said. “The path is higher from here.” Public companies set up for massive Bitcoin inflows A group of firms now known as Bitcoin treasury companies is driving that push. These are publicly traded companies that either already hold Bitcoin as a main asset or are planning to. Some of them, including Nakamoto, Twenty One, and Strive Asset Management, are going through mergers with other listed companies to raise capital by offering equity and using it to buy Bitcoin. Steven Lubka, the VP of investor relations at Nakamoto, told CNBC that a lot of that capital hasn’t even touched the market yet. “They’re waiting on SEC approval on the mergers, so there’s way more money that’s coming, that’s trying to buy Bitcoin but has not currently bought it,” Lubka said. “We have not yet seen the full impact of even just the money that’s already lined up.” Lubka said adoption isn’t the only driver right now. The broader macro setup is turning bullish too. He pointed to rising fiscal spending, surging stock prices, and a White House under Donald Trump that appears supportive of crypto. “Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class intersects with a huge amount of capital coming in through new financialization vehicles,” Lubka said, referring to the treasury companies. “You’re going to see a ton of fiscal spending, and you also have an administration that’s pro-Bitcoin,” he added. “These four factors are going to intersect together to produce a pretty material bull market.” Legislation and Fed drama add fuel for Q3 surge Bitcoin’s next leg higher could be helped by Washington. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said the political landscape could play a major role in the third quarter. If President Trump replaces Jerome Powell as Fed chair, markets could start betting on earlier rate cuts, which may boost investor confidence in the central bank’s independence. Kendrick also flagged a potential law: the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill now working its way through Congress. He believes it could pass in Q3 and trigger a ton of new retail demand. “It could encourage more retail investors to make their first investments in crypto, with Bitcoin the prime beneficiary,” Kendrick wrote in a research note last week. But not everyone’s completely calm. Kendrick said prices could get messy around late September because of fears tied to Bitcoin’s four-year cycle. In that cycle, the coin usually dumps around 18 months after a halving, when the rate of new supply is slashed. The last halving happened in April 2024, which puts that potential correction window directly into H2. Still, Kendrick isn’t backing off his forecast. He believes the current demand, especially from ETFs and treasury companies, will be enough to hold up the price even if some long-term holders start unloading. “The key this time will be whether increased ETF and Bitcoin treasury flows are enough to offset any other selling by long-term holders,” Kendrick said. “We think they will be.” By Kendrick’s estimate, Bitcoin could rise to $135,000 by the end of Q3, and then finish the year at $200,000. He expects that once investors stop worrying about another cycle repeat, the crypto will keep rising. “Once market concerns about this have passed, we expect Bitcoin to continue to rise to our end-Q4 forecast,” he wrote.

2025-07-06T16:00:00,"UK crypto crackdown: Harsher fines incoming for non-compliant traders","Britain’s crypto traders may soon face more than just market volatility—starting in January, failure to share personal details with trading platforms could cost them £300 each. The UK government is tightening its grip on the crypto economy with new tax compliance rules that require users to provide identifying information to exchanges and platforms. The Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, designed to close loopholes and capture unpaid capital gains, is expected to raise £315 million by April 2030. The fines—targeting both individual holders and non-compliant service providers—are part of a broader push to bring digital assets under traditional financial oversight and align UK regulations more closely with U.S. policy than the EU’s approach. According to the Daily Mail , holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and other cryptocurrencies must supply accurate information to exchanges and platforms they use for trading. Service providers that fail to report transaction details and tax reference numbers will also face penalties.

The new framework forms part of broader government efforts to increase tax compliance across digital asset transactions. Current UK tax rules require cryptocurrency holders to pay capital gains tax on profits, but enforcement has been limited by reporting gaps. The timing coincides with Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s refusal to rule out future tax increases following recent welfare reform reversals. Reeves defended the government’s fiscal approach, stating, “I’m not going to apologise for making sure the numbers add up.” The tax compliance measures complement the UK’s broader cryptocurrency regulatory framework, with draft legislation published in April 2025. This brings crypto exchanges, dealers, and stablecoin issuers under traditional financial services oversight.

UK authorities are extending existing financial regulations to crypto firms through phased implementation expected to be complete by 2026. The first phase focuses on stablecoins while the second phase will expand to broader cryptoasset categories and activities. Key rules and requirements are already being implemented throughout 2025. Cryptocurrency service providers will need to implement customer data collection systems and regular reporting procedures to avoid penalties. The compliance burden may increase operational costs for smaller exchanges and trading platforms. Users trading on non-compliant platforms or failing to provide required documentation face direct financial penalties. The £300 fine structure creates clear incentives for voluntary compliance while generating revenue from non-compliant actors. Chancellor Reeves acknowledged that recent policy reversals have been “damaging” but maintained that fiscal responsibility requires comprehensive tax collection.

According to reports, he raps, “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ That line isn’t just catchy—it’s another sign of how Bitcoin references are moving past finance blogs into hit songs. Adoption Numbers And Hype Based on reports from River, nearly 5% of the world’s population has used or owns Bitcoin so far. That’s a long way from Blockware’s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state’s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can’t be raided for other expenses. A follow‑up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3. Bitcoin Lyrics Hit Home Drake’s new verse isn’t his first high‑stakes play with crypto. Back in 2022, he put $1 million worth of Bitcoin bet on the Super Bowl.

The pop‑culture nods pull attention, while real‑world policies test whether Bitcoin can move from hype into everyday use.

In a new op-ed for Time , Jones says that while we can celebrate technological progress, there should also be consideration, or even “vigorous debate,” of the societal cost of game-changing technologies like AI. The Tudor Investment Corporation founder references a recent warning from Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who said AI could eliminate about half of all entry level white collar jobs in the next one to five years. Even if Amodei is only half correct, Jones says such a transformation would create “unprecedented social upheaval.” “If we follow the playbook of the last 45 years where over 92% of productivity gains went to shareholders over workers, and if Amodei is even half right on his unemployment prediction, you can bet we will face unprecedented social upheaval. In the worst-case scenario, the safety-net strains that high unemployment will place on states and municipalities will force many into bankruptcy. The federal government won’t be a good backstop because with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120% it won’t have the borrowing power it once did. Bond markets will tank and take stocks with them.” The investor calls for several responses to AI, including a federal law requiring AI content to be watermarked so it’s clear it’s AI-generated. Otherwise, Jones says “humans will become irrelevant in the world we are headed for if we don’t demand human authenticity.” Jones also calls for a bipartisan commission that addresses issues of productivity sharing, as well as bilateral talks with China to “start establishing shared AI safety protocols to protect the entire world from mistakes and bad actors.” “None of this is radical. It’s rational. The unemployment data on entry-level jobs is a call to action. The first signs of the societal disruptions of AI are already here.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Orion has jumped by 409.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $1.25 from a low of $0.2344. This massive surge has left the traders puzzled, though the reasons behind the pump remain unclear. Adding to the mystery, the project’s official X account appears to be suspended. This makes it difficult to verify any recent announcements or developments that might explain the price movement. Despite the uncertainty, some market analysts remain optimistic about the technical setup. One crypto analyst posted on X: “ORN another nice looking chart.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%.

The outlook is based on Ethereum’s long-term weekly charts, which show the asset has been consolidating in a descending triangle pattern since peaking in November 2021. Despite multiple failed attempts to break out of this structure, most recently in December 2024, the pattern of rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025 suggests mounting upward pressure, according to a TradingView analysis by Master Ananda on July 5. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The expert noted that April 2025 marked a lower low, forming a rounded bottom structure at the $2,425 support level. While ETH briefly dipped below that level, it quickly reclaimed it, signaling strong buying pressure. This move is seen as marking the end of a long bearish phase that began in March 2024. The key resistance level to watch is around $3,068, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement , followed by the $3,800 to $4,000 range, where price could revisit previous highs. However, the real target lies at $5,791, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, expected to be reached before the end of 2025. Ananda noted that momentum could potentially carry ETH as high as $8,500. “Now, if we really want to talk about minimum because we really don’t care about worst case scenario, the fundamentals are improving and everything is getting better, consider $5,791. This would be the minimum. With the Ethereum ETFs and the 2025 bull market, we then open up $8,500 and so on,” he said. Ethereum’s key support level Meanwhile, analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on July 6 highlighted the importance of Ethereum maintaining the $2,500 support zone. He observed that the second-ranked cryptocurrency continues to show resilience, holding firmly above this level, now viewed as a key pivot for potential upside momentum. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In his outlook, the analyst noted that the digital currency is finding consistent buy-side interest between the $2,500 and $2,600 range. This period of consolidation follows a volatile June, during which the price briefly dipped below $2,400 before quickly recovering. Currently, the next major resistance lies near the $2,800 and $2,900 range, a supply zone ETH has struggled to break above since May. A successful retest and bounce from $2,500 could pave the way for a breakout toward those levels. Ethereum price analysis At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,522, having remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, but was up more than 3% over the past week. ETH seven-day price chart.

2025-07-06T14:00:03,"Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So","Bitcoin started the month of July with a convincing rally to the upside, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment amongst investors from its performance by the end of June. The upward rally, however, cooled off following the release of positive employment data by the United States. Traders might have expected this data to be typically bullish, but that has hardly been the reality for the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, a certain investor cohort, as shown by on-chain revelation, has decided to return to the market and bet on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Retail Investors In, Long-Term Holders Out? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha highlighted the increasing divergence between retail and institutional behavior in the BTC market. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Taha started by pointing out that Binance Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has remained below $11.5 billion. The crypto pundit explained that this price level has been acting as strong resistance, as Bitcoin traders have repeatedly closed positions near this price threshold. Interestingly, these levels are very close to the same price region around which resistance was observed on June 10th. Taha stated that this could mean the bullish momentum is beginning to wane for the flagship cryptocurrency. On another hand, short-term holders (STH), who are typically the retail traders, have increased their exposure to the market by about 382,000 BTC. This can only mean that there has been renewed retail interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. Contrary to the short-term holders’ actions, the long-term holders (LTH) reduced their holdings by an amount similar to the STH exposure. Taha explained that this could be a result of profit taking or risk management within this investor class. In essence, the retail investors are “buying the dip,” while the more experienced are seemingly reducing their risks. Bitcoin Whales Enter Distribution Phase Also supporting the conceived idea of caution in institutions and whales, Taha reported that large holders (holders with over 10,000 BTC) offloaded about 12,000 BTC on the 3rd of July. This kind of move, according to the analyst, signals potential profit taking or perhaps strategic reallocation. Besides what they might signify, large transactions tend to have a substantial impact on market dynamics, as significant amounts of BTC are involved in each trade. However, the large holders were not the only profit takers. According to Taha, mid-sized whales (those holding 1,000-10,000 BTC) also shed some of their holdings. From June 30th, approximately 14,000 BTC were sold by this class. Deducible from these transactions is the idea that the whales seem to be in their distribution phase, either because they anticipate further bearish momentum or await better positioning opportunities. If macro conditions remain favorable, the Bitcoin market could resume its bullish rally, but this ultimately falls on the renewal of larger players’ confidence. For now, the road ahead remains uncertain. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $108,152, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

That's according to mempool – a holding area for unconfirmed blockchain transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners. On Satuday, the mempool had just 5,000 odd transactions awaiting inclusion, with the tally rising to 15,000 at press time, still a far cry from 150,000 when BTC's price first rose above $100,000 in late 2024, according to data source Blockchain.com . Since March this year, the tally has oscillated between $3,000 and $30,000, indicating anaemic demand for the network despite BTC establishing a foothold above $100,000.
