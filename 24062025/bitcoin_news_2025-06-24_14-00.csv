2025-06-24T11:45:59,"Chase Bank Shuts Down Man’s Bank Accounts With No Explanation, Forcing Wedding Cancellation and Flood of Debt Collectors: Report","A California resident is reportedly alleging that Chase Bank shut down his accounts and kept the money in them, throwing his life into disarray. Brian Adesman, 32, is suing Chase Bank to recover $185,000 that was allegedly in his accounts when the bank closed them “without any notice,” reports The U.S. Sun. Adesman, a founding lawyer of the Miller Adesman law firm, says he had been a Chase Bank customer for more than a decade and had both personal and business accounts. “They refused to tell me why they were holding my money. No warning. No explanation. Just silence – while my credit score collapsed and debt collectors flooded my phone… This wasn’t just my business account. Chase shut down my personal and client trust accounts, too, without cause. It wasn’t policy enforcement. It was financial destruction.” Adesman claims the bank “destroyed” his life because after the financial institution seized his funds, he was forced to cancel his wedding and move into a caravan due to missing mortgage payments on his Los Angeles apartment. He allegedly filed complaints against the bank with government regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Attorney General and the Department of Financial Services. But more than a year later, he’s still fighting for restitution. A Chase Bank spokesman says, “We identified concerning transactions and took appropriate action as permitted by our account terms.” Chase Bank also points to a separate lawsuit filed by a company in New Jersey that claims it was duped into making fraudulent payments, including $3.7 million deposited into Adesman’s law firm’s account. Chase Bank, however, did not confirm whether the allegations led to the freezing of Adesman’s accounts. Adesman says he conducted no questionable transactions and suspects the bank flagged him solely after he received lawful settlement payments for legal services provided to a Mexican client. He also says he was unaware of the New Jersey legal case. “I was never told about, involving parties I’ve never heard of and facts I know nothing about and yet Chase is now pointing to it as some sort of retroactive justification for what they did to me.” In his initial suit, the lawyer says that Chase vowed to return some of his funds to the tune of $175,649 via a cashier’s check within 10 business days. But Adesman says he never received the promised check.

2025-06-24T11:45:53,"Security questions arise with Ledger's new offline key recovery options rollout","Ledger will roll out a new key recovery feature for new wallets, allowing offline access to the private key. The move caused a mix of security concerns, as Ledger’s devices were offered as a way to make private keys inaccessible. Ledger will introduce a key recovery feature to new wallets going forward, with a secondary PIN available for some devices. The new service, known as Recovery Key, is optional and can be used entirely offline. Recently, the company published a whitepaper about the features available with its new offline recovery. The new Ledger Recovery key is a smart card that stores a copy of the master secret, which is used to generate the Secret Recovery Phrase. The card can share the master secret from the Ledger Hardware Wallet , connecting via Near Field Communication. The Secure Element contains a tamper-resistant chip, which stores the master secret with no chance of leaking or being taken out via hardware. The element adds several layers of security, including a dedicated operating system for exclusive communication with Ledger devices, as well as a secure factory environment to avoid tampering or placing compromised devices. This is the second attempt to offer recovery to Ledger users, an answer to several high-profile cases of locked devices. However, the recovery feature also raises additional security issues for abusing the secondary PIN. Ledger Recovery debuts on Flex and Stax models Ledger Recovery is specifically tailored to the touchscreen products Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax. The new spare key is held in another secure device and can unlock the original Ledger device. A user can opt to create multiple spare keys, which are also generated online and protected. “ With Ledger Recovery Key we are making secure self-custody easy-to-use for everyone. Too many people are compromising by keeping their assets on exchanges and insecure software wallets. With Ledger Recover and now Ledger Recovery Key, as well as the traditional 24-words, we are proud to offer a recovery solution for every category of user.” ~ Ian Rogers, Chief experience officer at Ledger The new service will exist along with Ledger Recover, a paid feature that allows access to the device. However, Ledger Recover is a de-anonymizing service, requiring KYC. Some crypto owners remain skeptical of having their identity linked to crypto ownership, after multiple kidnapping cases . Ledger wallet owners have also been targeted , mostly to be pressured to unlock the device. The device itself can also be lost or abused in some cases. Ledger has already announced over 7.5 million total sales, becoming one of the leading tools for crypto hardware storage. Ledger introduces transaction check As Web3 usage increases, Ledger also boosted its software to intercept potentially harmful transactions. Ledger Transaction Check is the newest feature in Ledger Live, aiming at vetting transactions. The extra security is mostly targeted at Ethereum users. Transaction Check just hit Ledger Live: meet real-time threat detection for your Ethereum. Every time you want to sign a transaction, it scans to flag potential threats. Powered by the industry's top risk analysis engines: @blockaid_ , @CyversAlerts , and @TenderlyApp . Tracked… pic.twitter.com/wur5EF7rPF — Ledger (@Ledger) June 23, 2025 While Ledger offers heightened security, signing with the devices may still be compromised. Bybit was reportedly using a Ledger Nano , but the exchange was still compromised via a multisig wallet that led to the loss of $1.4 billion. The feature adds more clarity to signing in an environment where malicious smart contracts can hijack the permission of Ethereum wallets, despite the secure hardware protection.

2025-06-24T11:42:07,"Ministry of Treasury and Finance Pressed the Button on Cryptocurrencies! Mehmet Şimşek Announced What Will Happen!","While many steps have been taken to regulate the cryptocurrency sector in Türkiye, a final move has come. At this point, Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that new steps were taken to prevent the laundering of criminal proceeds obtained from illegal betting and fraud through cryptocurrency asset transactions. According to AA, the Ministry of Treasury and Finance will introduce a regulatory package that will increase transparency and control in transactions made through Crypto Asset Service Providers (CSAs). In this context, the traceability of criminal proceeds is increased through time limits, transfer limits and strict identity checks. The report stated that crypto asset platforms must disclose information regarding the source and purpose of the money and other funds that are the subject of the transactions they mediate. In this context, it was stated that in all cryptocurrency transfer transactions, it will be mandatory to obtain a transaction description of at least 20 characters from the customer performing the transaction. With the new regulations, the cryptocurrencies in question will be prevented from being quickly removed from the system. At this point, it is planned to impose a time limit for crypto withdrawal transactions that do not apply to the travel rule. In this context, crypto withdrawals can only be made 48 hours after purchase, exchange or deposit transactions. This period will be at least 72 hours for the first withdrawal transactions to be made from the account. It was also stated that a daily limit would be imposed on stablecoin transfers, and that this would be a limitation of 3 thousand dollars and 50 thousand dollars per month. Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that these restrictions will ensure that additional oversight and control is applied to exchanges to prevent money laundering through cryptocurrencies. Şimşek added that no restrictions were imposed on the legitimate area. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ministry of Treasury and Finance Pressed the Button on Cryptocurrencies!

2025-06-24T11:41:02,"Massive Altcoin Breakout: 20%+ Daily Gains—Is This the Beginning of an AltSeason?","The post Massive Altcoin Breakout: 20%+ Daily Gains—Is This the Beginning of an AltSeason? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the first few days of May 2025, when the Bitcoin price broke above the consolidated zone around $96,000, the altcoins also triggered a massive upswing. Altseason is when 75% of the top 100 cryptos outperform Bitcoin for a period of time. This is complemented by rising Altcoin dominance and a drop in BTC dominance. The current Altcoin season Index chart suggests the Altseason could not be near, as the index remains stuck below 20, hinting towards the dominance of Bitcoin. As seen in the above chart, the altcoin market cap seems to be gaining ground, but the Altcoin season index continues to plunge. This suggests Bitcoin holds a significant dominance, and hence the liquidity inflow is largely into the star token rather than the other altcoins. However, over the past 90 days, only a few altcoins like SYRUP, HYPE and VIRTUAL have recorded three-digit gains, and many popular altcoins remain under bearish influence. Bitcoin & Stablecoin Dominance Reach Crucial Juncture It is a known fact that after Bitcoin & Ethereum, stablecoins like USDT or USDC are the largest traded tokens. Therefore, their dominance in the markets sheds light on the mindset of the investors regarding whether they are going with Bitcoin or altcoin. In an interesting update, the collective dominance of Bitcoin, USDT, USDC & DAI displays a similar pattern to the one it displayed during the previous Altseasons. A popular analyst, Moustache , refers to the combined dominance of the tokens and has discovered a very interesting pattern. The levels have triggered a bearish divergence after reaching a particular resistance. This has occurred before the start of the previous Altseasons. Now that the levels have again triggered a bearish divergence after testing the resistance, the analyst believes the Altseason 2025 is loading. Which Altcoins to Follow Ahead of the Altseason? Ever since Bitcoin has been making massive moves, the tokens within the top 10 do not seem to have followed the trend. However, the other altcoins, specifically the memecoins, AI, RWA, and DeFi tokens, have been making huge noise. Over the past few days, the SEI price has been rising with over 40% gains, while the current intraday trade suggests JasmyCoin, SPX6900, dogwifhat, Virtuals Protocol, Jupiter & Sonic have been attracting gains over 20%. Apart from these, many other tokens continue to possess double-digit gains, hinting towards the rising dominance of the altcoins. On the other hand, the BTC dominance faces rejection from the highs at 65.95% and could be heading towards the local support at around 64.69%. These could be crucial levels to access the next course of action, as a rebound could delay the AltSeason, while a bearish continuation could revive the hopes.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-altcoin-breakout-20-daily-gains-is-this-the-beginning-of-an-altseason/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:36:22,"WazirX News: Singapore Court Approves New Hearing on User Repayment","The post WazirX News: Singapore Court Approves New Hearing on User Repayment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Singapore High Court has granted Indian cryptocurrency platform WazirX the opportunity to present further arguments in its ongoing restructuring case. After months of anticipation and silence, WazirX confirmed the extension of its court-granted moratorium via a post on X (formerly Twitter). Singapore Court Allows WazirX to Present Its Case Previously, the court had declined to approve WazirX’s restructuring plan, prompting the company to file for relocation to Panama and rebrand itself as Zensui Corporation . However, the tide may be turning. In a statement, WazirX announced: “The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court’s sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium… from 6 June 2025 until the disposal of the aforesaid further arguments.” This extension could give WazirX a final chance to solidify its restructuring plan and potentially begin resolving user repayments. Will WazirX Users Finally Get Their Funds Back? Since the $234 million hack in July 2024 , thousands of users have waited in vain for clear communication or compensation. WazirX had earlier promised to return 85% of user balances, but that pledge has been mired in legal delays and unclear updates. Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court's sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium granted in HC/OA 1284/2024… pic.twitter.com/QdozZHnWVX — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 24, 2025 Despite mounting pressure on social media, the company has largely remained silent, offering only generic reassurances like “we are doing our best.” In their latest tweet, WazirX stated: “We are currently awaiting directions from the Court on the next steps and will keep you informed as soon as we have more clarity.” This statement, while more official, still lacks concrete timelines—leaving users frustrated and in limbo. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Users May Won’t Get Full Lost Funds Back – Here’s Why! , One Year Later: Still Waiting As July 2025 approaches, it marks one year since the WazirX security breach—one of the largest crypto hacks of 2024. The extended silence and lack of action have left users questioning the company’s commitment to recovery. The latest ruling by the Singapore High Court offers a ray of hope—but only if WazirX takes swift and transparent steps forward. Final Thoughts WazirX’s restructuring and moratorium extension could be a turning point—but whether it leads to actual repayment for users or more delays remains to be seen. With mounting pressure and legal timelines closing in, WazirX must act fast to regain trust and credibility in the crypto community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Singapore High Court has granted WazirX permission to present further arguments regarding its restructuring plan and has extended the moratorium on legal action. This allows WazirX more time to propose how they will handle debts, including user repayments. Will WazirX users get their funds back? WazirX previously promised to return up to 85% of user balances based on holdings at the time of the hack. However, actual repayments have not yet started , and users are awaiting a final court-approved resolution. When can WazirX users expect the repayment to begin? As of now, there is no fixed timeline .

2025-06-24T11:36:01,"Japan Reveals New Crypto Rules That Could Legalize Bitcoin ETFs","The post Japan Reveals New Crypto Rules That Could Legalize Bitcoin ETFs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Japan is getting serious about crypto and the changes coming could shake up everything from taxes to Bitcoin ETFs. On June 24, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) released a document that could mark a turning point for the country’s approach to digital assets. Titled “Considerations regarding the structure of the system surrounding crypto assets,” the report confirms a new working group has been set up to explore major regulatory reforms. These proposals will be discussed further at a Financial Services Council meeting on June 25. Here’s why you should care. Crypto Could Soon Be Treated Like Stocks Right now, crypto in Japan is regulated under the Payment Services Act – a framework that doesn’t really match how people are using these assets today. The FSA is now considering moving crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which would officially treat digital assets as financial products. That one change could open up a lot of doors. A Big Tax Break Is on the Table One of the biggest outcomes of this shift? Lower taxes. Under current rules, crypto investors face up to 55% in comprehensive taxation. But under FIEA, the system would switch to a flat self-assessment tax of around 20%, just like stocks. It’s a move that could make Japan far more appealing to both everyday investors and institutions, especially those holding back due to the heavy tax burden. Bitcoin ETFs Might Finally Get the Green Light Another major change in sight: Japan could lift its ban on Bitcoin ETFs. If crypto is treated as a financial product, it paves the way for regulated crypto investment vehicles – something Japan has held back on for years. With ETFs gaining traction globally, this would bring the country in line with bigger markets and potentially attract new capital. Not Just Hype! Web3 Is Policy Now These changes aren’t coming out of nowhere. They’re part of Japan’s wider push to grow its economy through innovation and digital assets. The government’s Grand Design and Action Plan for New Capitalism (2025) makes it clear: crypto, NFTs, and other Web3 tools are now part of the plan to boost productivity and unlock value across Japan’s regions. The goal is to support businesses, create investment opportunities, and tap into digital assets in ways that help Japan compete globally. Following the Global Shift Interestingly, Japan’s sudden crypto momentum might be linked to growing support for crypto in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration and in pro-crypto states like Texas. For Japan, a country known for its cautious stance, this looks like a clear pivot from regulation to integration. And if these proposals go through, it could be the moment Japan officially steps back into the global crypto race.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/japan-reveals-new-crypto-rules-that-could-legalize-bitcoin-etfs/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

All Eyes on Capitol Hill as Crypto Markets Bleed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress and the Senate, and markets are holding their breath. With Bitcoin plunging to $98.5K and altcoins struggling, crypto investors are looking for clues on interest rate cuts, inflation risks, and what’s next for the economy. This comes at a critical moment, with Powell under intense political pressure and global tensions flaring. The financial world wants answers and fast. Under Pressure: Trump, Warren, and Fed Officials Push for Cuts Powell is facing heat from both sides of the aisle after the Fed chose to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.5% in June. President Donald Trump slammed the Fed’s cautious stance, calling it a mistake and demanding deep rate cuts of 2–3%. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller are also calling for earlier cuts, possibly as soon as July. According to CME FedWatch data , the odds of a July cut stand at 23%, while chances for a September cut are much higher at 82%. Powell’s testimony is expected to address why the Fed is still holding back despite growing demands. Crypto Takes a Hit as Tariff Talk Spooks Investors The crypto market is in rough shape. Bitcoin has dropped to a multi-month low, and altcoins are deep in the red. Much of this stems from fears around Trump’s proposed trade tariffs, which have added more uncertainty to an already fragile economy. Powell is expected to talk about how these tariffs might impact the Fed’s decisions. If he leans toward easing rates, crypto prices could bounce. But if he sticks to a cautious tone, the U.S. dollar could strengthen and that usually means more pain for digital assets. Tensions in the Middle East Stir Inflation Fears Recent U.S. airstrikes in Iran have pushed oil and gold prices higher, raising fresh concerns about inflation. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran is also raising the risk of a potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping route. If that happens, fuel prices could skyrocket, making it harder for the Fed to meet its inflation goals. Powell’s comments on these risks will be watched closely, as they could shape expectations for interest rate policy through the rest of 2025. Powell’s Testimony Could Shift the Market Powell’s upcoming remarks could be a turning point. Investors want to know – will he signal relief with rate cuts, or continue to play it safe? Whatever he says, the outcome is likely to shape the market’s direction for months to come, especially in crypto.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-powell-cut-rates-all-eyes-on-capitol-hill-as-crypto-markets-bleed/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:21:11,"What’s Next for XRP, ADA, and BTC Prices?","The post What’s Next for XRP, ADA, and BTC Prices? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market started strong today, as Bitcoin jumped past $106K and altcoins followed with strong gains. But prices pulled back slightly after Iran broke the ceasefire deal. Still, the market remains in the green, with XRP and Cardano holding onto impressive 7–9% gains. Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that Bitcoin has officially flipped the trend. After a major crash below $100K, BTC is now back on an uptrend, breaking past $103K and hitting resistance. #Bitcoin has a trendswitch. It's uptrending now, after we've had a massive liquidation crash taking place to sub $100K. It broke through $103K and hit the next resistance.

If the conflict de-escalates again, Bitcoin could be setting up for another strong rally. Yesterday's Iranian attack on U.S. bases was a near copy of their 2020 response. Back then, after the U.S. killed General Soleimani, Iran launched missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq. A symbolic strike with advance warning to Iraq to prevent casualties. Now look what happened to… pic.twitter.com/hrNJqG1F70 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 24, 2025 Bitcoin Shows Strength Analysts are doubling down on their $120,000 target for Bitcoin this year, and recent developments make that case even stronger. Bitcoin has shown resilience above $100K despite geopolitical tensions. Falling oil prices and Fed rate cut expectations in July are also boosting investor confidence. XRP: Breakout Ahead with ETF Hopes and DeFi Expansion XRP is at a major turning point. Institutional interest is picking up, and XRP ETF odds are higher than ever. Meanwhile, the long-standing Ripple vs. SEC case is finally coming to a resolution. These two catalysts alone could fuel a major rally. To top it all, Ripple is teaming up with Cardano to bring XRP into DeFi. Through cross-chain bridges and Lace wallet support, XRP holders could soon earn rewards, including NIGHT tokens from Cardano’s upcoming airdrop. With all this lining up, XRP could be on the verge of its biggest breakout in years. In previous cycles, XRP hovered around $0.50 before exploding 6x to $3 in just six weeks. We could see a similar move ahead. Cardano’s Midnight Could Be the Breakout Catalyst Cardano could finally have the catalyst it needs to break out: Midnight . This new protocol is built directly on Cardano and fully relies on it for security, governance, and token movement. The upcoming NIGHT token airdrop is huge, with 50% of the supply going to ADA holders. If Midnight succeeds, it could quickly become a top 25 project, and that momentum would directly boost Cardano’s value. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that the Lace wallet, which already supports ADA and BTC, will soon support XRP too. He is also working on a cross-chain bridge between XRP and Midnight’s sidechain. Also, the odds for a Cardano ETF approval in 2025 have jumped to 79%. All these signs show that Cardano is gaining momentum, and a breakout could be next. Looking ahead to Q4, the Fed rate cuts and more liquidity could spark the next big crypto rally. If global tensions cool and central banks ease up, Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano could be ready to rise again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/whats-next-for-xrp-ada-and-btc-prices/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|XRP|AIRDROP","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:20:17,"Dogecoin Leads Market Recovery with 8.15% Pump: What are the Best Meme Coins to Buy Right Now?","Just like that, the war between Israel and Iran is over, at least according to US President Donald Trump. The crypto market, including meme coins, has reacted positively to the statement after being on edge when the US joined the fray and bombed three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Trump posted on Truth Social that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, effectively ending what he called ‘The 12-Day War’. While Iran reportedly confirmed this , an official from the country said that it won’t stop the hostilities unless Israel ceases attacking the Islamic country. Despite that, the market has already reacted positively to Trump’s statement. $DOGE Leads Meme Coin Rally The meme coin market saw a significant jump over the past 24 hours as the US president’s post made its rounds on social media and news outlets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the meme coin market had a 10% spike in its market cap and 16% in its trading volume over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin ($DOGE) led the rally as it rose by 8.15% during the same period. The meme coin’s price is currently at $0.1663 and is inching closer to the $0.17 level it held before the American bombing of Iran over the weekend. 3 Meme Coins to Watch for as the Market Recovers The recovery of the crypto market has put everyone in buy mode. With so many options out there, here are three of the top meme coins you shouldn’t miss: 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find the Latest Meme Coins with the Telegram-Native Crypto Trading Bot With the flurry of activity in the meme coin market today, it can be a challenge to find the hottest one to invest in. The information is spread across different platforms, and unscrupulous entities could try to lure you in with fake coins and other scams. That’s where Snorter Bot comes in. This project, powered by its native Snorter Token ($SNORT) , simplifies how you trade with its Telegram-native trading bot by letting you snipe new crypto , manage your portfolio, detect scams, and more. To support the project, you can get $SNORT tokens via its official presale page. Each token only costs $0.0961, but a price increase will happen a day from now, so it’s always better to act as soon as you can. Our Snorter Token buying guide has all the information you need to do this, from connecting your crypto wallet to staking your tokens. If you decide to stake your $SNORT tokens, you can enjoy passive rewards. It’s currently set at 266% p.a., but expect this to change as more investors lock in their tokens in the staking pool. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Go All In on Bitcoin, Earn Free $BTC Airdrops Even in the world of meme coins, Bitcoin ($BTC) still reigns supreme. That’s why the team behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is rallying true $BTC believers to help push the crypto to $250K and beyond. Its main selling point is its free $BTC airdrops when the crypto’s price reaches $150K and $200K. Then, a free $BTCBULL airdrop will happen when $BTC hits the $250K mark. Buying $BTCBULL tokens gives you the chance to participate in these events. Aside from that, the team will have regular token burns at the $125K, $175K, and $225K $BTC price milestones. These will reduce the supply of $BTCBULL, which should further drive their prices. Getting on the team’s native token is easy. First, visit the official BTC Bull Token presale page , connect your crypto wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ) to the presale widget, input how many tokens you’ll buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. You’ll then receive your tokens when the presale concludes. You can get $BTCBULL for only $0.00258 at the moment, which is a small price to pay to get the chance to join in the free airdrop events. Staking is an option, too, if you want to receive passive rewards while supporting the project. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , HODLing is another alternative, especially if you’re banking on it being worth as much as $0.06467. 3. Pepe ($PEPE) – The OG Meme Coin with No Signs of Slowing Down Pepe ($PEPE) may have spawned countless copycats, but it remains one of the top meme coins, along with $DOGE and Shiba Inu ($SHIB). Proof of this is its trading activity over the past 24 hours, which saw a 10% increase in its market cap and a 32% jump in its trading volume. But behind its degen façade, is some method to the madness. For one, there’s its burning mechanism that permanently removes $PEPE coins from circulation and pushes up the price of the remaining coins. Then there’s its generous staking rewards. This encourages HODLers to continue supporting the project. $PEPE tokens are widely available in major exchanges, including MEXC , Binance , and KuCoin . Time to Buy as Meme Coins Make a Comeback Investors have been buying after Trump’s ceasefire post, with $DOGE leading the rally. If you’re looking to pump your funds into up-and-coming meme coins, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are also attractive options. But before you buy, do your research first.

2025-06-24T11:20:13,"Bitcoin Shorting: Abraxas Capital Faces Staggering $14.5M Loss","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Shorting: Abraxas Capital Faces Staggering $14.5M Loss In the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, high-stakes bets are a daily occurrence. However, even seasoned players can find themselves on the wrong side of a market move. Recently, news broke that Abraxas Capital, a prominent London-based investment manager, incurred a significant unrealized loss of $14.5 million on its Bitcoin shorting position within a mere 24 hours. This development, reported by Arkham on X, serves as a stark reminder of the immense volatility and inherent risks involved in institutional crypto trading , particularly when dealing with substantial crypto shorts . What Exactly Happened? Abraxas Capital’s Bold Bet The report from Arkham, a well-known on-chain analytics platform, highlighted the rapid turn of events for Abraxas Capital. While the exact timing of their short position entry isn’t publicly detailed, the $14.5 million figure represents an unrealized loss, meaning the position is still open and the loss hasn’t been crystallized by closing the trade. This substantial figure, accrued over just one day, underscores the swift and often brutal movements characteristic of the Bitcoin market. Despite this recent setback, Abraxas Capital continues to hold a formidable presence in the crypto derivatives market. Their portfolio still includes over $450 million in total crypto shorts, with more than $200 million specifically allocated to Bitcoin. This indicates a continued, albeit challenged, bearish outlook on certain crypto assets or perhaps a complex hedging strategy designed to offset other long positions within their broader investment framework. For an investment manager of Abraxas Capital’s caliber, managing such large positions requires sophisticated risk assessment and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Understanding Bitcoin Shorting: A Risky Endeavor For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin shorting , or short selling, is a trading strategy where an investor profits from a decline in an asset’s price. It’s the inverse of traditional investing, where you buy low and sell high. Here’s how it generally works: Borrowing: The short seller borrows Bitcoin from a broker or exchange. Selling: They immediately sell the borrowed Bitcoin on the open market at the current price. Waiting: The short seller then waits for the price of Bitcoin to drop. Buying Back: If the price falls, they buy back the same amount of Bitcoin at the lower price. Returning: The bought-back Bitcoin is returned to the lender, and the short seller pockets the difference, minus any fees or interest on the borrowed assets. While seemingly straightforward, short selling carries significant risks, especially with highly volatile assets like Bitcoin. Unlike a traditional ‘long’ position where your maximum loss is your initial investment (if the asset goes to zero), a short position has theoretically unlimited loss potential. If the price of the asset rises instead of falls, the short seller has to buy it back at a higher price to return it, and there’s no ceiling to how high an asset’s price can go. This is precisely what likely contributed to Abraxas Capital’s recent unrealized loss . Short Selling vs. Long Investing: Key Differences To further clarify the contrast, consider the fundamental differences: Feature Short Selling Long Investing Market Outlook Bearish (expect price to fall) Bullish (expect price to rise) Profit Source Price decline Price increase Risk Profile Potentially unlimited loss Limited loss (initial investment) Mechanism Borrow, Sell, Buy Back, Return Buy, Hold, Sell Time Horizon Often shorter-term Can be short or long-term The Peril of Institutional Crypto Trading: High Stakes, Higher Volatility The case of Abraxas Capital underscores the unique challenges faced by firms engaged in institutional crypto trading . While institutions bring significant capital and sophisticated strategies to the market, they are not immune to its inherent volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are known for their dramatic price swings, often influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and even social media sentiment. For an investment manager like Abraxas Capital, navigating these waters means constantly re-evaluating positions, managing significant exposure, and having robust risk management protocols in place. A $14.5 million loss, even if unrealized, is a substantial sum that requires careful consideration. It highlights the fine line between calculated risk and significant financial setback that even large, experienced players must walk. Moreover, the transparency offered by on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham means that institutional movements, both profitable and loss-making, are increasingly visible. This level of public scrutiny adds another layer of pressure for firms managing substantial crypto shorts and other positions. Navigating Significant Crypto Shorts: Strategies and Risks When an entity holds significant crypto shorts , especially in a market as volatile as Bitcoin’s, risk management becomes paramount. While the exact strategies employed by Abraxas Capital are proprietary, institutional traders typically employ several techniques to mitigate potential losses: Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically closing a position if the price moves against them by a certain percentage, limiting potential losses. Position Sizing: Carefully determining the amount of capital allocated to a single trade to ensure no single loss can critically damage the overall portfolio. Hedging: Holding offsetting positions (e.g., being long in one asset while shorting another correlated asset) to balance risk. Diversification: Spreading investments across various assets to avoid over-reliance on any single one. Constant Monitoring: Utilizing advanced analytics and real-time data to track market movements and adjust positions rapidly. One of the biggest threats to short sellers, particularly in crypto, is a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when a cryptocurrency’s price rises sharply, forcing short sellers to buy back their borrowed assets to cover their positions and limit further losses. This forced buying, in turn, pushes the price even higher, creating a vicious cycle that can lead to massive losses for those holding short positions. Bitcoin has a history of dramatic short squeezes, fueled by its passionate community and rapid liquidity shifts. The fact that Abraxas Capital still holds over $200 million in Bitcoin shorts after this unrealized loss suggests either a strong conviction in their bearish outlook for the medium to long term, or that these shorts are part of a more complex, multi-layered hedging strategy designed to protect a larger portfolio from potential downturns. What Does This Unrealized Loss Mean for the Market? The news of Abraxas Capital’s significant unrealized loss on its Bitcoin short position carries several implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: Reminder of Volatility: It serves as a powerful reminder that even with institutional-level resources and expertise, the crypto market remains incredibly volatile and unpredictable. Institutional Caution: While institutions are increasingly entering the crypto space, such events might lead some to approach highly leveraged or directional bets with greater caution. Transparency in On-Chain Data: The fact that Arkham could identify and report this loss highlights the growing transparency of on-chain data, allowing for a clearer view of institutional flows and positions. This is a double-edged sword: it offers insights but also exposes large players to public scrutiny. Lessons for All Traders: Both institutional and retail traders can learn from this. The importance of strict risk management, understanding the full scope of potential losses, and not over-leveraging positions cannot be overstated. Even the pros get it wrong sometimes. This event doesn’t necessarily signal a widespread bearish sentiment among institutions, as many continue to explore and invest in crypto through various avenues, including spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, it does highlight the inherent risks of aggressive directional bets in a market prone to rapid reversals. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Picture for Bitcoin Bitcoin has seen remarkable price action recently, fueled by factors such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., increasing institutional adoption, and the upcoming halving event. In this context, taking a significant Bitcoin shorting position might seem counterintuitive to some. However, institutions might short Bitcoin for several reasons: Hedging: If Abraxas Capital holds substantial long positions in other crypto assets or even in Bitcoin itself, shorting could be a way to hedge against a potential market downturn, protecting their overall portfolio value. Contrarian View: Some firms might genuinely believe that Bitcoin is overvalued at certain points and due for a correction, positioning themselves to profit from such a decline. Arbitrage Opportunities: In complex trading strategies, short positions might be part of an arbitrage play across different exchanges or derivatives markets. Regardless of their specific motivation, this incident reaffirms that the crypto market is a battleground where even the most sophisticated strategies can face unexpected headwinds. The ongoing evolution of institutional crypto trading will undoubtedly continue to generate both incredible profits and significant losses, shaping the future landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Market Realities The $14.5 million unrealized loss incurred by Abraxas Capital on its Bitcoin shorting position serves as a powerful, real-world example of the inherent volatility and risk associated with cryptocurrency markets, even for experienced players engaged in large-scale institutional crypto trading . It underscores that while the potential rewards in crypto are high, so too are the risks, particularly when employing strategies like holding substantial crypto shorts . This event should prompt both institutional and retail investors to double down on robust risk management practices, conduct thorough due diligence, and always be prepared for unexpected market movements. In a landscape where transparency is increasing thanks to platforms like Arkham, the actions and outcomes of major players become lessons for all. The saga of Abraxas Capital’s Bitcoin short is a vivid illustration that in the world of digital assets, fortune favors the prepared, but even the prepared can face staggering challenges.

2025-06-24T11:19:26,"Kaspersky reports compromised mobile malware stealing users' crypto seed phrases","Kaspersky security researchers have uncovered a mobile malware campaign targeting cryptocurrency users through infected applications. SparkKitty spyware reportedly steals device screenshots containing seed phrases using optical character recognition technology across iOS and Android platforms through official app stores. SparkKitty malware infiltrates official app stores targeting crypto Kaspersky researchers discovered the SparkKitty spyware campaign in January 2025, following their previous identification of SparkCat malware targeting cryptocurrency wallets. The new threat distributes malicious applications through unofficial sources as well as official Google Play and App Store platforms, with infected apps already removed from Google Play following researcher notifications. SparkKitty attacks iOS and Android platforms with multiple delivery mechanisms for each. On iOS, malware payloads are delivered through frameworks that masquerade as legitimate libraries like AFNetworking.framework or Alamofire.framework, or obfuscated libraries masquerading as libswiftDarwin.dylib. The malware also inserts itself directly into applications. Android operating systems employ both Java and Kotlin languages, with Kotlin versions employed as malicious Xposed modules. The majority of malware versions indiscriminately hijack all the images on devices, although researchers detected similar malicious clusters employing optical character recognition to attack specific pictures with sensitive information. The campaign has been active since at least February 2024, and it has also shared targeting tactics and infrastructure with the previous SparkCat operation. SparkKitty has a wider reach than SparkCat’s targeted attack on cryptocurrency seed phrases because it scrapes all images that are available from infected devices. This has the potential to harvest other kinds of sensitive financial and personal information stored in device galleries. TikTok mods from obscure stores serve as primary infection vector Kaspersky analysts initially came across the campaign when tracking regularly suspicious links that were propagating modifications of TikTok Android apps. The modified apps executed additional malware code when users launched main app activities. The config file URLs were presented as buttons within the compromised apps, launching WebView sessions to display TikToki Mall, an internet shopping portal that takes cryptocurrency for consumer items. Registration and purchasing were restricted to require invitation codes, so researchers were unable to determine the store’s legitimacy or if it was operational. iOS infection vectors exploit Apple Developer Program enterprise profiles to circumvent normal app install restrictions. Screenshot of an infected app on the App Store Attackers hijack enterprise certificates for enterprise-level organizational app distribution, enabling malicious apps to install on any device without App Store approval. Enterprise profile misuse is one widespread tactic employed by developers of inappropriate apps such as online casinos, software cracks, and illegal modifications. Infected versions of TikTok iOS applications request photo gallery permissions during startup, which is absent in genuine releases of TikTok. The malware is integrated into frameworks that pretend to be AFNetworking.framework and tampered AFImageDownloader classes and other AFImageDownloaderTool components. Android malware variants steal images through cryptocurrency-themed applications Android versions of SparkKitty operate through cryptocurrency-themed applications with malicious code embedded in entry points. The malware requests configuration files containing command and control server addresses, decrypting them using AES-256 encryption in ECB mode before establishing communication with remote servers. Image theft occurs through two-stage processes involving device fingerprinting and selective upload mechanisms. The malware creates MD5 hashes combining device IMEI, MAC addresses, and random UUIDs, storing these identifiers in files on external storage. Profile installation flow. Source: Kaspersky Casino applications utilize LSPosed framework integration, functioning as malicious Xposed modules that hook application entry points. One infected messaging application with cryptocurrency exchange features reached over 10,000 installations on Google Play before removal following Kaspersky notifications. Progressive web applications propagate through scam platforms advertising Ponzi schemes on popular social media platforms. These PWA-containing pages prompt users to download APK files that register content download handlers, processing JPEG and PNG images through Google ML Kit optical character recognition technology to identify text-containing screenshots.

2025-06-24T11:15:57,"Israeli Arrested for Selling Secrets to Iran for Crypto","The post Israeli Arrested for Selling Secrets to Iran for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As global tensions increase and digital assets gain ground, a new front in warfare technique is emerging, one that’s funded by crypto. In an eye-opening instance, Israeli authorities have arrested a 27-year-old man from Tel Aviv, accusing him of spying for Iran in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. Though Trump announced an Iran-Israel ceasefire, this spy case has added a new twist in the global arena. Spying for Crypto Raises Red Flags As per the local media report , authorities claim that the man had been in contact with an Iranian agent for several months. During this time, he reportedly carried out several intelligence-related tasks at the agent’s request. These included photographing the homes of Israeli public officials, documenting military bases, and even spray-painting graffiti, possibly as a form of coded messaging or psychological warfare. According to investigators, the suspect received thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency as payment for his work. This digital trail has raised red flags, showing how cryptocurrencies can be used to fund covert and potentially dangerous activities. During a search of the man’s home, officials confiscated computers and digital storage devices believed to have been used to communicate with his Iranian handlers. While the full extent of his activities is still being investigated, the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court has extended his detention until June 26 to allow authorities more time to gather evidence. Iranian Recruitment Campaigns Targeting Israelis The Shin Bet and Israeli police issued a joint warning following the arrest, urging the public to remain cautious of foreign contact, particularly on social media. They revealed that Iranian intelligence and affiliated terror groups are actively trying to recruit Israelis through online platforms. Security officials emphasized that any citizen caught cooperating with enemy states would face severe legal consequences. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Iran Breaks Ceasefire With Israel, $500M Wiped From Crypto Market , Warning Call for the Public? This case surfaces amid growing crypto-related concerns on both sides. Just last week, Iran’s central bank imposed stricter controls on domestic crypto exchanges after a cyberattack drained $90 million from Nobitex, the country’s largest platform. As Iran tightens its oversight, the use of crypto in covert operations and illicit financing continues to blur the lines between financial freedom and national security threats. In a digital world where enemies may be only a message away, the role of crypto in global conflict is becoming harder to ignore. However, this is not the first time crypto has been used for illegal activities. There are many scams, terrorist fundings in the past have shaken the ground for crypto investors, and this new warfare psychology is something that needs to be taken seriously with grounded crypto rules. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Reclaims $105K as Iran Tensions Ease, Bulls Regroup","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) ""Always fade geopolitics,"" the founders of the LondonCryptoClub newsletter said Monday as bitcoin BTC fell below $100,000 after Iran fired missiles at U.S. airbases in the Middle East. It looks like they were right. BTC quickly reversed its drop and has since topped $105,000, restoring spirits in the broader market, where VIRTUAL, JUP and SEI are flashing gains of over 20%, according to CoinDesk data. The path of least resistance appears to be to the higher side, with President Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although unconfirmed reports of fresh aggression by Tehran and a response from Jerusalem introduce a note of caution. Also supporting a gain: At least two Fed members appointed by Trump are now leaning in favor of a rate cut next month and the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency is studying the use of crypto holdings in the mortgage qualification process. Anthony Pompliano's ProCap Financial plans to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, with a focus on bitcoin asset management and revenue generation. ""While the ceasefire optimism is driving short-term gains, the risk of renewed tensions remains elevated,"" Valentin Fournier, the lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""That said, ETF inflows and ProCap’s IPO signal growing institutional demand, even near cycle highs — a strong vote of confidence for long-term upside."" The U.S. Federal Reserve removed the concept of “reputational risk” from its formal bank supervision program, supposedly easing crypto banking restrictions. Bloomberg reported that VMS Group, a multifamily office with just under $4 billion in assets under management, is considering a $10 million allocation to strategies managed by decentralized finance hedge fund Re7 Capital. In traditional markets, the dollar index fell to 98, extending Monday's sell-off, while the price of gold dropped to its 50-day simple moving average at $3,318. Nasdaq futures chalked out a golden crossover, offering bullish cues to the crypto market. Stay alert! What to Watch Crypto June 25: ZIGChain (ZIG) mainnet will go live .

Faster blocks mean faster confirmations, with more frequent data updates for wallets, DeFi apps, and L2s — creating a smoother, more responsive blockchain. DeFi efficiency could improve as a result of tighter arbitrage windows, faster price discovery and lower trading fees due to higher liquidity in AMMs. Key timing changes include reducing block proposal time to 3 seconds, attestations to 1.5 seconds and aggregation to 1.5 seconds. Monnot argues Ethereum’s “service price” will rise, making it more competitive as a global settlement and confirmation layer. Potential drawbacks include bandwidth pressure, validator performance issues, and network instability if poorly implemented. The proposal targets the 2026 Glamsterdam upgrade, which focuses on gas optimizations and protocol-level speedups across the Ethereum blockchain.

2025-06-24T11:08:49,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 24, 2025","The crypto market is up today following a de-escalation in the Middle East. 98 of the top 100 coins have appreciated over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 2.9% over the past day, now standing at $3.23 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $150 billion. TLDR: The crypto market records a sharp and notable upward swing; 30 coins saw double-digit rises BTC rose back up to $105,471, and ETH jumped 7.5% to $2,422; Markets reacted to de-escalation in the Middle East, with higher-risk assets benefiting; ”People aren’t panic selling like in previous cycles; they’re accumulating”; The market sentiment moves from the fear into the neutral zone; Investors are awaiting further signals. Crypto Winners & Losers The crypto market finally took a turn for the green today. All the top 10 coins per market cap are up and with notable increases. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated by 3.5%, now trading at $105,471. For comparison, this time yesterday, the coin changed hands at $101,924. Furthermore, Ethereum (ETH) rose by 7.5%, now trading at $2,422. It’s one of the category’s best performers again. XRP (XRP) saw the highest increase in this category of 8.1% to the price of $2.2. Moreover, nearly all the top 100 coins saw their prices increase in the same period, and nearly 30 of them saw double-digit increases. The best performer is Sei (SEI) with a 36.1% rise to $0.2801. SPX6900 (SPX) follows with a jump of 27.8% to $1.31. At the same time, OKB (OKB) and WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) are the only two coins with drops, with decreases of 3% and 0.8% to $51.84 and $47.96, respectively. The market plunged nearly two weeks ago following a significant escalation of conflict in the Middle East. The ongoing geopolitical instability created uncertainty in the markets across the board. After more than a week since Israel had attacked Iran, US President Donald Trump claimed last night that a cease-fire between these two countries had started. However, uncertainty still looms as Israel didn’t comment, and Iran fired shots. President Trump says Israel-Iran ceasefire is “in effect."" Follow live updates. https://t.co/bv18k3sEzW — CNN (@CNN) June 24, 2025 Nonetheless, easing geopolitical tension increases interest in higher-risk assets, which BTC benefits from. ‘People Are Accumulating, Not Panic Selling’ Commenting on altcoins, Tom Bruni, Editor-in-Chief and VP of Community at Stocktwits , said that one of the most interesting current developments is that Bitcoin’s dominance has been rising for 33 months. It hit a 4.5-year high at 65.73%. Typically, this spike would signal that altcoins were “dying off.” And even many altcoins are underperforming, the overall market cap is still sitting near historical highs. “That tells us capital is still flowing into altcoins, even if the performance hasn’t kept up,” Bruni said in an email. “Given how aggressively firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have moved into Bitcoin, it’s honestly surprising altcoins haven’t performed worse,” he writes. “On-chain data shows this is likely because most altcoins with market caps above $1 billion continue to grow with long-term holders. People aren’t panic selling like in previous cycles; they’re accumulating.” Meanwhile, Glassnode found that Loss Sellers rose 29% since 10 June. However, Conviction Buyers are also increasing. Since June 10, $BTC investors classified as Loss Sellers rose 29% (from 74K to 95.6K), showing growing pressure on weak hands. But Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses – others are actively lowering their cost basis. pic.twitter.com/cwuN8TBAe2 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 23, 2025 James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented on the impact of the rising tension in the Middle East on the markets. Over the weekend, it created expected economic uncertainty. “The nexus between oil prices and the Bitcoin market is increasingly evident,” Toledano says. Higher oil prices mean higher energy costs, directly impacting Bitcoin mining profitability and network dynamics. If the production cost floor rises due to this, it could support prices but also increase volatility. “Even the whiff of higher oil prices can send the price of a Bitcoin lower, and we saw this play out over the weekend before markets re-adjusted upward this morning, possibly pricing potential crude oil price hikes in.” However, the recent drop coupled with sustained institutional inflows and rising correlation with gold signal “a maturing narrative. Its ability to rebound quickly like equities of late, also speaks to its mainstream financial adoption,” Toledano writes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,471. It hit its intraday high of $105,927 earlier this morning (UTC), recovering from the all-time low of $100,183. Currently, it’s 5.7% down from its May all-time high of $111,814. The coin will test the resistance level of $106,000. Should it break it, it will retest $107,580 and $109,041. At the same time, the next support level is $103,965. Should it break this, it may fall to $102,199 and $100,487 Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,422. This is a notable rise from the daily low of $2,206. The intraday high now stands at $2,425. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has re-entered neutral territory, exiting the briefly visited fear zone. The Fear and Greed Index has increased from 37 yesterday to 47 today . Fear has stopped driving the prices lower, with investors now awaiting further signals. There is a potential of revisiting the greed zone.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and the stock market saw increases over the last day. The S&P 500 increased by 0.96%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 1.06%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.89%. The rises followed the de-escalation in the Middle East, easing investors’ concerns. Is this rally sustainable? The overall macroeconomic and geopolitical situation is unstable at the moment and could go either way. Consequently, the market will react. That said, analysts remain bullish in the long term.

Based on data from October 2024 to May 2025, the report revealed significant shifts in investor patterns among digital asset holders. BTC and ETH remained the “power couple” that dominated 58.8% of the total non-stablecoin investment in May, while XPR overtook SOL in third place. ETH’s recovery story also stands out, with the asset rebounding from a low of 3.89% holdings in April 2025 to show substantial improvement by May, though it has not yet returned to its November 2024 peak of 11.12%. Key Findings: One-in-three crypto assets are now in BTC : As of May 2025, BTC accounts for 30.95% of total investor holdings, representing approximately one out of every three coins in portfolios — a notable increase from 25.4% in November 2024. The current ETH/BTC holding ratio stands at 0.27, meaning investors typically hold $4 in BTC for every $1 in ETH. XRP rode on its ETF momentum : XRP has overtaken SOL to claim the third-largest position among non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with holdings doubling from 1.29% to 2.42% by May 2025. This surge is largely attributed to growing institutional and retail optimism surrounding potential SEC approval of XRP Spot ETFs. Solana bulls in deep slumber : In contrast, despite its previous bullish momentum in Q3 2024, Solana holdings declined 35% from 2.72% in November 2024 to 1.76% in May 2025, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation.

The Israeli prime minister told him that he could not cancel the attack and that some response was needed to Iran’s violation of the ceasefire.

Middle East war escalation drives tensions in crypto market ""CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE…"" –President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/hLTBT34KnG — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 23, 2025 The crypto companies’ latest acquisition comes amid a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East – a development that is driving investors from risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies to safe-haven investments such as gold. The geopolitical turmoil escalated after a military showdown between Iran and Israel last week as the two countries traded missile fire. On Sunday, the situation changed after the U.S. got involved and bombed sites suspected of being key to Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. The attack shook global oil markets as well as digital assets, but gold’s price surged. Trump announced that he had declared a ceasefire intended to bring an end to the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, but both sides continued to exchange fire on Tuesday morning despite public acceptance of the truce. “I have instructed the IDF to respond forcefully to Iran’s violation of the ceasefire with powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran.” Israel Katz, Defence Minister of Israel. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, a 3% increase in the last 24 hours, but down roughly 1.7% in the past week.

XRP, which has generally maintained its $2 level since then, continues to see strong demand. While major companies announced major moves to create XRP Treasuries after Bitcoin and Ethereum, Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie spoke highly of XRP. In a recent interview, Sal Gilbertie said that XRP shows strong demand and long-term bullish potential. Stating that there has been tremendous interest in XRP recently, the famous CEO drew attention to the increasing demand for XRP-related investment products. “We have known for many years that there has been pent-up demand for XRP. Will there be more upside potential than Bitcoin? Many say yes… I think XRP has very good upside potential.” Sal Gilbertie also stated that Wall Street is ignoring the true power of the XRP community. According to the CEO, Ripple plays a significant role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and its influence is being underestimated. At this point, Gilbertie added that he sees XRP as the most useful crypto. Finally, comparing XRP to other major cryptocurrencies, Gilbertie described Bitcoin as a digital store of value, as digital gold. Regarding Ethereum, Gilbertie admitted that he does not have a deep understanding of the ETH ecosystem and did not give a clear assessment of ETH. However, Teucrium CEO stated that XRP is developing and argued that there is much more growth potential. Although he did not give an exact price target, he predicted that the XRP price would rise to much higher levels. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s broader crypto agenda is under scrutiny. Lawmakers introduced the COIN Act to restrict political figures from crypto involvement, due to ethical concerns. Separately, Panther Metals Plc surged 21% after announcing it would integrate Bitcoin into its own treasury and use it as collateral for mining acquisitions. Stock Buyback Won’t Stop Trump’s Bitcoin Plans Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind the Truth Social platform, announced a $400-million stock buyback program, and explained that the move will not interfere with its previously disclosed plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. In a notice that was released Monday, the company stated that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million in common shares, and clarified that this initiative is separate from its cryptocurrency ambitions, which include investing more than $2 billion into Bitcoin. Announcement from TMTG After initially denying reports that it planned to raise $3 billion for cryptocurrency investments, Trump Media later confirmed that it secured $2.5 billion in funding for Bitcoin purchases. According to the filing, the company’s Bitcoin strategy includes a private placement offering amounting to roughly $2.3 billion. These funds were generated through the resale of 56 million shares and 29 million shares linked to convertible notes, based on debt and equity agreements previously registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC, which is now chaired by Paul Atkins, approved the registration statement tied to Trump Media’s Bitcoin initiative earlier this year. The company also submitted applications to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF and, through Truth Social, a dual ETF tied to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These applications came after the SEC began approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January of 2024 and spot Ether ETFs in May of 2024. Beyond corporate investments, President Trump proposed the creation of a national “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a broader “Digital Asset Stockpile” via a March executive order. These reserves will hold digital assets seized or forfeited to the US government. However, Trump advisers have hinted at broader ambitions for accumulating digital assets beyond legal forfeitures. Critics, including lawmakers on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, accused the president of leveraging his office to financially benefit crypto-aligned entities. Bill Targets Trump’s Crypto Ties The disapproval of Trump’s crypto ties is only increasing. California Senator Adam Schiff and nine other Democratic lawmakers recently introduced the COIN Act . This is a bill that is specifically aimed at preventing what they describe as the financial exploitation of digital assets by the US president and other public officials. Announcement from Sen. Adam Schiff The legislation comes in response to the growing concerns over President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly after the disclosure that he earned $57.4 million through World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform backed by members of his family. According to Schiff , Trump’s involvement with digital assets raised “significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns” regarding the use of presidential power for personal financial gain. The COIN Act proposes to bar current and former public officials—including presidents and their families—from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of digital asset like cryptocurrencies, meme coins, NFTs, or stablecoins. These restrictions would apply for a period extending from 180 days before taking office to two years after leaving office. The bill specifically targets payment stablecoins, after WLF’s announcement of its USD1 stablecoin in March. An Abu Dhabi-based company reportedly planned to use the stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment on Binance. Additionally, the Trump family’s ownership stake in WLF reduced from 75% in December to 40% in June, with the divestment potentially netting millions in proceeds. An April report from the State Democracy Defenders Action revealed that Trump’s digital asset holdings were worth approximately $2.9 billion, and consists of about 40% of his total net worth. The bill by Schiff is one of the Senate’s earliest attempts to directly confront the president’s crypto-related financial interests. On the same day, California Representative Maxine Waters introduced a parallel bill in the House called the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act. The measure was introduced shortly after Trump held a private dinner to honor top holders of his personal meme coin. Despite their high-profile nature, the future of either bill is still very uncertain. With Democrats in the minority in both chambers of Congress, the legislation faces an uphill battle. Even if it passes the House and Senate, it would likely be vetoed by President Trump. Panther Metals Rides Bitcoin Treasury Wave Trump and TMTG are not alone in their Bitcoin ambitions. Panther Metals Plc, a UK-listed mineral exploration company, also recently unveiled a strategic shift by integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, combining traditional mining operations with digital asset holdings. On Monday, the company announced plans to acquire £4 million ($5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin to position the asset not just as a store of value but as a form of productive capital. As part of this strategy, Panther will use £1.3 million ($1.75 million) in Bitcoin from its treasury as collateral to complete the acquisition of the Pick Lake mining deposit in Ontario, Canada, while maintaining full Bitcoin exposure. Announcement highlights from Panther Metals This move is a departure from the standard Bitcoin treasury model, where companies passively hold the asset. Panther plans to actively leverage Bitcoin to finance high-quality mineral projects, minimizing shareholder dilution by tapping into more favorable terms available in the digital asset market. CEO Darren Hazelwood believes in Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency volatility, and stated that the hybrid strategy enhances the company’s resilience and market adaptability. The Pick Lake asset is part of the larger Winston Project, a high-grade, polymetallic zinc, copper, and precious metals deposit. It represents approximately 85% of the project's total mineral resources. Zinc is a key component in galvanizing steel and battery technologies, and is considered a critical mineral, adding even more strategic value to the acquisition. Hazelwood claims the model equips Panther to thrive across varying market cycles. Investor enthusiasm was evident, as shares of Panther Metals (PALM) surged 21% on the London Stock Exchange on Monday. Over the past month, PALM stock climbed 150%, including a 61% rise in just the last week, according to Google Finance. Panther Metals share price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) Panther now joins a growing list of corporations adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies.

According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) experienced a price surge following news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran . The largest cryptocurrency by market cap almost touched the $106,000 threshold, reaching as high as $105,927 in the past 24 hours. At press time, BTC has gone up 3.9% and is currently trading hands at a price of $105,302. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin has suffered through the geopolitical events that have broken through between Israel, Iran and the United States . Within the past few days, BTC fell into a slump following news of the U.S. bombing three of Iran’s nuclear bases. On June 22, BTC experienced a sharp decline, dropping well beyond it previous peak of $106,003 just two days prior. On June 23, Bitcoin reached its lowest point since May, dropping to $98,974.

The past month has seen the cryptocurrency fall by nearly 2%. Not only that, Bitcoin’s market cap also enjoyed a 3.24% boost, climbing up to $2.09 trillion following the recent price surge. Additionally, BTC’s trading volume also saw a 6.9% increase compared to the previous day, amounting to $52.8 billion based on current market prices. Even the wider crypto market cap has experienced a 2.1% surge after news of the ceasefire broke, amounting to $3.36 trillion. A ceasefire signal between Israel and Iran may have eased investor concerns for now. Crypto markets often recover quickly when geopolitical fears recede. However, traders still have their eyes on the continuing conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite the agreed upon deal between the two countries, brokered by Donald Trump and Qatar, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Iran of violating the ceasefire only two hours after the deal was announced. According to the BBC, despite Iran furiously denying the accusation, Israel plans to “respond forcefully to Iran’s violation of the ceasefire with intense strikes” targeting the nation’s capital in Iran. It remains to be seen whether Israel will follow through with the threat, and how it will affect Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

2025-06-24T10:38:29,"Why is the crypto market going up today?","Crypto market recovered as Bitcoin reclaimed the $100k level, following reports of a potential truce between Israel and Iran that may bring an end to the recent ongoing hostilities between the two nations. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that both nations have agreed to a full truce, which he said will bring an end to what he called “The 12 Day War.” The announcement helped calm investor fears and gave markets a reason to rally after a volatile weekend. According to crypto.news, the global crypto market cap rose 2.8% to hit $3.39 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon in Asia. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged 3.4% to cross $105k, while Ethereum ( ETH ) spiked 6.7% to reclaim the $2,400 level. Major altcoins followed the trend, with XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) climbing 8.5%, 8.2%, and 7%, respectively. The rebound follows a steep weekend sell-off triggered by heightened conflict, after Israel intensified its airstrikes and the U.S. reportedly launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities. BTC had dropped nearly 4% to $98,615, while ETH and SOL saw declines of up to 10% amid investor concerns over an extended conflict and its potential economic fallout. Now, with geopolitical risks easing, market sentiment has improved sharply. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 47 points to hit 65, back into “Greed” territory. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows the average RSI across the market rose to a neutral 58. Open interest also climbed by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped 28% to $482 million per CoinGlass data . Interestingly, most of the liquidations came from shorts, indicating a possible short squeeze that may have helped fuel the rally even more.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $350.4 million in inflows on Monday, a sharp rise from just $6.37 million on Friday. Ethereum ETFs also saw strong inflows of $100.7 million, reversing from previous day outflows of $11.3 million. Adding to the bullish momentum, Strategy’s Michael Saylor revealed the company had bought another $26 million worth of Bitcoin. Strategy’s latest purchase came amid a broader 2025 trend, with more public companies following its lead and adopting Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset. For instance, Japan’s Metaplanet recently executed a $108 million purchase , while entrepreneur and investor Anthony Pompliano announced the launch of a Bitcoin treasury firm backed by prominent institutions such as Citadel and Jane Street, with the goal of building a $1 billion Bitcoin reserve. On the regulatory front, the Federal Reserve’s decision on June 23 to remove the term “reputational risk” from its bank supervision guidelines was seen as a key catalyst. The change eliminates a subjective barrier that had deterred banks from engaging with crypto firms. Industry observers believe this move could normalize banking access for digital asset companies and accelerate crypto-financial integration.

2025-06-24T10:35:11,"Ripple’s Arthur Britto resurfaces on X after 14-year silence","A mysterious Ripple co-founder and co-developer of XRP Ledger has resurfaced on X after 14 years of silence, sparking speculation that his reappearance means big things are ahead for XRP. Arthur Britto, a mysterious co-creator of the XRP Ledger alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb and also a co-founder of Ripple, posted on X today for the first time in 14 years. 😶 — Arthur Britto (@ahbritto) June 23, 2025 Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed that the post, which contained a single emoji, was legitimate and not the result of any hack or unauthorized access. The development sparked excitement in the XRP community, as Britto has kept an extremely low profile despite his key role in the project. He has never given interviews, appeared in photos, or taken part in public discussions. The secrecy surrounding Britto has even fueled speculation about whether he’s a real person. However, this seems unlikely as Ripple CTO David Schwartz has publicly referenced Britto before. In a 2021 thread on X, Schwartz confirmed Britto is a “separate and distinct human being” who is simply “intensely private.” In that thread, Schwartz also mentioned that Britto was entitled to 2% of assets created with the Stellar ledger, referencing an agreement that Jed McCaleb allegedly violated. Source: @JoelKatz You might also like: CZ speculates Satoshi Nakamoto is an AI from the future Britto has also been tied to the bold claim that “XRP was designed to reach $10,000,” a statement that gained traction from a 2019 YouTube video claiming he made the prediction in 2017. However, there’s no confirmed source linking the quote directly to him. What is confirmed is Britto’s original focus on utility over hype. In a 2013 internal memo, Britto wrote: “The value of XRP is probably less important than the spread. I expect most people and institutions using the ledger to ignore XRP altogether.” Some users believe Britto’s sudden reappearance could signal major developments ahead for XRP. “The network is waking up. And Britto doesn’t post for nothing,” wrote John Squire, highlighting the coincidence that Britto’s return came as XRP hit 1.5 million transactions in 24 hours, the highest volume in four months. So why does his return matter? Because this week, $XRP just hit 1.5 million transactions in 24 hours — the highest in 4 months. The network is waking up. And Britto doesn’t post for nothing. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 23, 2025 You might also like: Ripple’s David Schwartz highlights confidence in evading phishing scams following co-founder’s major XRP loss",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/ripples-arthur-britto-resurfaces-on-x-after-14-year-silence/,"BTC|WALLET|XRP","News|Cryptocurrency|Ripple|XRP",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T10:30:53,"Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern—Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead","Bitcoin rallied above $105,000 in mid-morning European trading on Tuesday, clawing back losses sustained over the weekend after dipping below six figures for the first time since May. Yet the respite may prove fleeting, says veteran technician Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend). Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2021 On side-by-side charts of the current cycle and the 2021-to-2024 arc, the analyst argued that Bitcoin is “the same exact pattern—run-up, one high, back down, second high,” followed by an ABC corrective sequence that in 2021 bottomed only after a second, deeper flush. “Gut says no,” he told viewers when asked whether last Friday’s sell-off had already marked capitulation. “We’ve been talking about this ABC since March… people were calling for new lows; I said nope, we got five waves at the top, we got an ABC and then we go— and that’s when the alts take off.” His base case now envisions a relief rally toward the $107,000–$108,000 band—the level where a trend-line projected from the two post-halving peaks intersects—before a final leg lower drives price into what he calls the “pain box” sandwiched between the 0.702 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracements of the entire rally from last October’s $58,000 breakout. In 2021 that zone ultimately wicked to the exact 0.618, a move he believes could repeat, implying spot levels between roughly $96,500 and $92,000. “This measurement fits the parameter now… if it wants to turn around and rip, great,” he conceded, “but there’s still a very good chance that was not the end.” Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss Internally, the analyst parses the current drop as the developing C-wave of a larger flat, subdividing into a classic five-wave impulse. Wave three, he notes, appears complete; wave four “could come up high,” granting altcoins a short-lived pop, “but hopefully, again, sooner than later, we roll over.” He cites 2021’s July fractal, when Bitcoin bounced 20% before sliding a final time, as a psychological template. “When there’s a big news narrative event,” he observed, “we’ll get a little relief—people think it’s done—then wham, one more thing to scare retail.” Macro sentiment, he argues, remains fragile. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange gap at $92,000 is drawing “average-retail” bids, a setup he characterises as a “washing machine” in which professional money fronts liquidity only to fade it. “Retail is just a washing machine, man… that buy isn’t going to get filled,” he warned. Still, he reiterated long-term optimism, revealing he “hammered some buys” during Monday’s dip and advising his followers to dollar-cost average—“not financial advice”—through the turbulence. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Quantum Ascend’s upside target for the ensuing impulsive advance is comparatively restrained: $132,000, a level he says enjoys “two pieces of confluence” and would coincide with “the alts moment” when Bitcoin dominance finally cracks. “We will eventually work our way back up near the top of this B-wave… flag a little, and then boom,” he predicted, referencing November 2021’s so-called “Trump pump” that ignited a multisector altcoin surge. For now, traders watch the 0.702–0.618 pocket and the mooted relief ceiling at $108,000. Should Bitcoin slice through support without that interim bounce, the analyst says, the flush could conclude “sooner than later,” clearing the runway for what he calls “the next few months—our moment.” In his sign-off he urged viewers to “be an adult, live through it,” but also confessed palpable excitement: “I feel really good about where we’re at.” Whether the market shares his confidence will likely become clear once the final C-wave verdict arrives—perhaps, he hopes, within the week. At press time, BTC traded at $105,077.

2025-06-24T10:19:16,"Fed Cracks Down: U.S. Banks Can No Longer Block Crypto Over “Reputational Risk”—Now What?","The United States Federal Reserve has removed “reputational risk” from its supervisory framework for banks, a decision that could reshape how financial institutions engage with the crypto sector. In a policy update released Monday, the Fed said it will now focus on more specific financial risk discussions instead of the vague and often criticized reputational risk metric. For years, crypto firms have argued that reputational risk has been used as a vague and unfair justification to block or sever banking relationships with crypto firms, contributing to what many referred to as “debanking.” @federalreserve announces that reputational risk will no longer be a component of examination programs in its supervision of banks: https://t.co/7Gwn1UuyNx — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) June 23, 2025 With the change, banks may now find it easier to do business with digital asset companies without fear of supervisory pushback. Fed Clarifies Banks Risk Ratings, Dropping Barrier Long Blamed for Crypto Exclusion The policy shift may ease access to financial services for companies operating in the digital asset space, many of which have faced challenges in maintaining banking ties over the past several years. “This is a win, but there is still more work to be done,” said U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis in response to the announcement. Lummis, a pro-crypto lawmaker from Wyoming, has been vocal about the need for regulatory clarity in the crypto space and has criticized what she called the “assassination” of digital asset businesses in the U.S. through aggressive regulatory practices. In February, I exposed the Fed’s aggressive reputation risk policies that assassinated American bitcoin & digital asset businesses. Today, the Fed announced it will scrap reputation risk as a factor in its bank supervision. This is a win, but there is still more work to be done. https://t.co/AOZSr0IFcp pic.twitter.com/1FtsIcNJsI — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 23, 2025 According to the Federal Reserve, the removal of reputational risk is meant to clarify how examiners evaluate a bank’s risk management practices. The updated guidance emphasizes that the formal rating will now reflect both quantitative and qualitative elements tied directly to financial performance and safety. “This change does not alter the Board’s expectation that banks maintain strong risk management,” the Fed said, adding that the adjustment is not meant to prevent banks from using the concept of reputational risk in their own internal assessments. Historically, reputational risk was defined by the Fed as the possibility that negative publicity, true or not, could lead to customer losses, litigation, or a drop in revenue. Critics in the crypto industry have long argued that the term was too broad and too subjective, allowing regulators to apply inconsistent standards, especially when it came to digital assets. Fed Ends ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ Tactics with Reputational Risk Reform The decision comes after years of what some have described as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ,” a period during which more than 30 crypto and fintech firms reported being cut off from banking services. Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, welcomed the change. “The supervisory process will now be more transparent and consistent,” he said. “We have long believed banks should be able to make business decisions based on prudent risk management and the free market, not the individual perspectives of regulators,” he added. The Fed has already begun reviewing and removing references to reputational risk from its guidance materials. It is also planning to train examiners on the new framework and coordinate with other federal banking regulators to ensure consistent application. The removal of reputational risk references will be done gradually as existing guidance is updated. Although banks are still required to manage risks in line with existing regulations, the shift could provide relief for crypto firms seeking stable banking relationships in the U.S. It also follows a broader trend of regulatory recalibration, as several federal agencies appear to be easing crypto-related restrictions introduced in previous years . The crypto industry scored several wins in recent months as federal regulators eased long-standing banking barriers. The FDIC removed “reputational risk” from its bank oversight criteria , following the Senate Banking Committee’s approval of the FIRM Act. In May, the OCC confirmed banks can handle crypto trading and delegate services. The FDIC also greenlit crypto activities without prior approval. On June 17, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoin regulation, with strong bipartisan support. The bill now heads to the House, potentially cementing the first comprehensive US crypto framework. Still, some observers warn the change could reduce oversight and open the door to riskier bank behavior if not properly monitored. But for the digital asset industry, the removal of reputational risk marks a moment of progress after years of regulatory uncertainty.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price has been down more than 75% since December 2024, and Q1 2025 played a significant role in pushing it deep down the well. However, in April of Q2 2025, bullish forces revived and took it to the 0.236 level-based resistance in mid-May. Despite the efforts, the Polygon was still very low and was among the list of altcoins that showed muted growth in Q2 compared to other altcoins. However, the muted growth was brief as mid-May to June bears pushed its price back to April’s low, which shows that the asset strongly lacks bullish conviction in the short term. The POL price could pull below $0.1000 if bearish forces continue downward pressure. All these circumstances occurred during Donald Trump’s presidential start in 2025, and by H1 so far, the market participants have witnessed multiple wars, resulting in bearish dominance. The recent Israel-Iran agreement was the most significant factor that pushed altcoins like POL’s price in June. However, on June 24th, POL saw a 7% intraday rise with a ceasefire announcement, which reignited people’s expectations. Therefore, if the conditions improve, the 0.236 Fibonacci level could be retested in June or July. If it clears that $0.4572 level in June or July, the odds of clearing Fibo are 0.50, 0.786, and the 1.0 level could be retested by the end of 2025. Additionally, RSI has reached oversold territory, and with the recent intraday rise, RSI has reversed, too. It shows that the Bullish sentiment is increasing in the short term.

2025-06-24T10:10:28,"Trump Media Affirms Bitcoin Plans Amid $400M Stock Buyback","Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced on Monday that its newly authorized $400 million stock repurchase program will not impact its ongoing plans to create a substantial Bitcoin treasury. The move comes as the firm advances a bold cryptocurrency investment strategy, despite rising scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. According to a company notice, the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $400 million in common stock. However, the company clarified that the share buyback initiative is separate from its cryptocurrency plans, which involve a $2.3 billion private placement aimed at building a Bitcoin reserve. Trump Media had previously denied reports of a $3 billion fundraising effort for digital assets but later confirmed it had secured $2.5 billion for that purpose. SEC Greenlights Trump Media’s Bitcoin Investment The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, approved the registration statement related to the Bitcoin funding plan in June. Documents show that Trump Media raised the capital through the resale of 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares linked to convertible notes under debt and equity agreements. In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Trump Media has applied to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF . A separate filing by Truth Social seeks approval to list a dual ETF tied to both Bitcoin and Ether. The SEC has been greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs since January 2024 and Ether ETFs since May, indicating a shifting regulatory environment toward mainstream crypto investment products. Trump’s broader crypto ambitions also include the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile —proposed in a March executive order. These reserves would contain digital assets forfeited to the government, though advisers have hinted at additional ways to expand the holdings. Political Scrutiny Intensifies Over Digital Asset Plans Despite Trump Media’s reassurances, political backlash is growing. Lawmakers from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations have accused President Trump of using his office to benefit crypto firms through initiatives like the Strategic Reserve. Coinciding with the announcement, Senator Adam Schiff introduced the COIN Act, which seeks to bar presidents and other public officials from issuing or endorsing digital assets . If passed, the legislation could place Trump Media’s Bitcoin strategy in legal jeopardy.

2025-06-24T10:10:17,"Crucial Iran Israel Ceasefire: What It Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Crucial Iran Israel Ceasefire: What It Means for the Crypto Market In a significant development echoing across global headlines, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) has confirmed that the Iran Israel ceasefire has officially entered its implementation stage. This crucial announcement, reported by Jin10.com and citing Chinese media CCTV, marks a potentially pivotal moment for the Middle East and, by extension, the intricate web of global financial markets, including the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency space. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding the ripple effects of such geopolitical shifts is paramount. Understanding the Iran Israel Ceasefire: A Glimmer of Hope? The news of an operational ceasefire between Iran and Israel is a development that demands attention. While specific details of the agreement remain under wraps, the mere confirmation of its implementation phase suggests a de-escalation of tensions that have long simmered in one of the world’s most sensitive regions. This move could signal a cautious step towards a more stable environment, potentially easing concerns that have weighed on international relations and economic forecasts. Historically, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been characterized by deep-seated animosity and proxy conflicts, contributing to regional instability. Any formal or informal agreement to cease hostilities, even temporarily, can have far-reaching consequences. It’s not just about the immediate cessation of conflict; it’s about the potential for reduced uncertainty, which is a commodity highly valued in financial markets. Why Geopolitical Stability Matters for the Global Economy The interconnectedness of the modern world means that events in one region can send shockwaves across continents. Geopolitical stability is a cornerstone of a thriving global economy . When major powers or key regions are embroiled in conflict, several economic consequences typically unfold: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can impede trade routes, disrupt energy supplies, and affect the movement of goods and services, leading to inflation and shortages. Investor Uncertainty: Heightened tensions cause investors to become risk-averse, pulling capital from speculative or volatile assets and seeking safer havens. Commodity Price Volatility: Prices of essential commodities like oil and gas are particularly sensitive to geopolitical events, as production and transit routes can be threatened. Reduced Consumer Confidence: Economic uncertainty can lead consumers to reduce spending, further dampening economic growth. Conversely, signs of de-escalation or peace often lead to renewed optimism, encouraging investment and fostering economic growth. A ceasefire, even if fragile, can inject a dose of confidence into markets that have been bracing for worse outcomes. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: Opportunities and Risks So, how does this Iran Israel ceasefire news specifically relate to the cryptocurrency market? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to global macro events. In fact, it often reacts with amplified volatility due to its relatively smaller market capitalization compared to traditional assets. Here’s how geopolitical shifts can influence digital assets: Flight to Safe-Haven Assets: During times of extreme uncertainty, investors often seek safe-haven assets . Traditionally, this has been gold, the U.S. dollar, or government bonds. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has increasingly been considered a safe haven by some, particularly during periods of fiat currency instability or regional conflict. A de-escalation could see some of this ‘safe-haven’ demand for Bitcoin wane, as investors might rotate back into riskier, higher-yield assets. Risk-On Sentiment: If the ceasefire holds and fosters greater global stability, it could encourage a ‘risk-on’ sentiment. This means investors might be more willing to allocate capital to growth-oriented and higher-risk assets, which includes cryptocurrencies. Increased investor confidence could lead to broader capital inflows into the crypto ecosystem, potentially boosting prices across the board. Market Volatility: While a ceasefire generally implies positive sentiment, initial reactions can still be volatile as markets digest the news and assess its long-term implications. Traders might take profits on assets that rallied during the period of heightened tension, or new capital might flow in, causing price swings. Altcoin Performance: Bitcoin often leads the market, but altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to perform well during periods of broader market optimism. If the ceasefire contributes to sustained positive sentiment, we could see altcoins experiencing significant gains as investor appetite for riskier, higher-reward assets increases. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and broader economic indicators all play significant roles. What are the Challenges and Lingering Questions? While the news of a ceasefire is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to approach it with cautious optimism. Several challenges and questions remain: Fragility of the Ceasefire: Is this a temporary truce or a step towards a more enduring peace? The long history of tensions suggests that any agreement could be fragile and subject to immediate reversal if underlying issues are not addressed. Underlying Issues: A ceasefire addresses immediate hostilities but doesn’t necessarily resolve the fundamental disagreements and power dynamics that fuel the conflict. Broader Regional Dynamics: The Middle East is a complex region with numerous interconnected conflicts and alliances. This ceasefire, while significant, might not immediately resolve other regional flashpoints. Global Economic Headwinds: Even with improved geopolitical stability, the global economy still faces challenges such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and potential recessions in major economies. These factors will continue to influence market performance, including crypto. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst Evolving Geopolitics Given the potential for both positive and negative market reactions to geopolitical news, here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, particularly those involving major global powers or regions with significant economic implications. News sources like IRNA, Jin10.com, and CCTV can provide direct updates, but always cross-reference. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of different cryptocurrencies and potentially traditional assets, can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Practice Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Geopolitical events can trigger rapid price movements, making robust risk management essential. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. While short-term volatility due to geopolitical news can be unsettling, focusing on the long-term potential of the technology and its adoption can help weather temporary storms. Assess Bitcoin’s Role: Continue to observe Bitcoin’s performance during periods of geopolitical stress. Its increasing acceptance as a potential safe-haven asset could further solidify its position in global finance. A Path Towards Stability? The confirmation of an Iran Israel ceasefire entering its implementation phase is a development that brings a cautious sense of relief. While the road ahead remains uncertain and filled with complexities, any step towards de-escalation in a region as pivotal as the Middle East is a positive sign for geopolitical stability and, by extension, the global economy . For the crypto community, this news underscores the profound interconnectedness of world events and the digital asset space. Investors should remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate the evolving landscape, always mindful of both the opportunities and the inherent risks that come with a world in flux.

2025-06-24T10:10:00,"Cardano Price Prediction Experts Now Eyeing Bitcoin Solaris as the Faster, More Profitable Bitcoin Alternative","Cardano has built its reputation on research-driven development and a loyal community. But recently, even some of its strongest advocates have started looking elsewhere. With ADA price predictions pointing to sluggish or even negative short-term movement, investors are exploring faster and more lucrative options. One name keeps rising through the noise: Bitcoin Solaris. A new wave of analysts and early adopters believe Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) offers what Cardano currently cannot. It is not just about speed. It is about accessibility, real utility, and a presale that is catching fire. The shift is not random. It is driven by real numbers and revolutionary design. ADA Holds Its Ground, But It Is No Longer Enough Cardano is still a respected force in the layer-one race. Its staking ecosystem and development roadmap are well structured. However, the excitement around it has dulled. ADA’s current price trends are uninspiring, and predictions are showing a possible decline. This has raised concern among retail traders who are searching for quicker wins or better fundamentals. The current stagnation is not a flaw in Cardano’s vision. It is simply a signal that market sentiment is shifting toward projects that can offer both high performance and immediate potential. Bitcoin Solaris Captures the Moment Bitcoin Solaris is doing what most coins promise but fail to deliver. It is faster, lighter, and truly decentralized. More importantly, it is structured to make wealth-building not only possible but accessible. Unlike traditional mining projects, Bitcoin Solaris puts power into your hands, literally. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, anyone with a smartphone or basic device will be able to mine BTC-S without owning a mining rig. That alone redefines who gets to participate in crypto wealth generation. But accessibility is only part of the story. Bitcoin Solaris is built on solid performance benchmarks. A dual-layer blockchain structure separates the base Proof-of-Work layer from the fast Solaris Layer. Transaction throughput reaches over 10,000 transactions per second. Finality is achieved in just 2 seconds, thanks to an optimized block rotation mechanism. Validator rotation occurs in real time to maximize decentralization and network stability. Smart contracts are fully integrated and support advanced logic for real-world applications. These are not promises. These are benchmarks already embedded in the project’s DNA. Early Bitcoin Changed Lives, BTC-S Is the Second Chance Tokenomics That Make Sense Where many projects inflate token supply or rely on hype cycles, Bitcoin Solaris keeps things focused and sustainable. The total supply of BTC-S is fixed at 21 million tokens. That number is not just symbolic. It is the foundation of a carefully balanced economy. 66.66 percent of the supply is allocated for mining over the next 90 years. 20 percent support the ongoing presale. 5 percent powers liquidity pools. Smaller percentages are reserved for ecosystem growth, marketing, and staking rewards. This structure ensures that control remains with the community, not just insiders. It encourages long-term value, not quick flips. You can read more in detail on the Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics Page . The Buzz Behind the Breakout Crypto influencers and analysts are starting to break down the project publicly. A detailed breakdown of Bitcoin Solaris’s mechanics and potential was recently published in a review by Crypto Vlog , which highlighted its layered structure and mobile-first vision. Enthusiasts are not just watching. They are participating. More than 11,500 early adopters have already secured tokens through the presale. Over 5 million dollars has been raised. And with less than six weeks left until launch, the clock is ticking on what could be the fastest-growing crypto event of 2025. Presale Momentum Is Unmatched We are now in phase 8 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale. The price per token is 8 dollars. In the next phase, it jumps to 9 dollars. The launch price is set at 20 dollars. That represents a potential 150 percent return in just a few weeks. Over 11,500 unique buyers have joined the movement. Momentum has not slowed even as the price continues to rise. This presale is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive in recent memory. The team is backed by audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , offering transparency and security to new investors. To stay connected, you can visit the project’s Telegram or X profile for daily updates and market responses. Why Bitcoin Solaris Feels Different It is not just another altcoin. Bitcoin Solaris is designed for utility, scalability, and reward. From mobile mining to lightning-fast transactions, it is redefining what it means to earn in Web3. Cardano will always have its place in the ecosystem, but if speed, profitability, and timing matter to you, then BTC-S may be the better answer for 2025. One link. One app. One opportunity to mine and earn from the palm of your hand. Start mining and explore what Bitcoin Solaris has already built before the rest of the market catches up.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

The fall continued in June, eroding nearly 38% of its gains to April’s low near $0.55 support level. The bleeding price has pierced its strong standing support zone in H1 2025, which aligns with the “FR volume profile level” at $0.60. This level was of utmost value, and losing this support makes the situation weaker for ADA. This all happened with geopolitical changes in June that pulled the ADA market to April’s low. However, ADA has seen renewed buying from this level back in April, and if it repeats the same this time, a rise above $0.60 could lead to a retest of the channels’ upper border again and break if firm bullish conviction joins in a future session. ADA must close above $0.74 to confirm a bullish breakout, which could open the path to retesting $1.10, as this was a significant resistance level since mid-December 2024. A breakdown here would be catastrophic, which could push the fall toward the lower border of the falling wedge. The support levels that could halt ADA from falling are $0.55 and $0.40. However, if selling fails to push the sustain above H1 support by clearing $0.60 in the short term and reverses, a fall could be severe. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) June 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.
