2025-06-24T12:53:09,"The crypto bull run is here: top 3 altcoins to buy today","A crypto bull run could be on the horizon following the de-escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel and growing speculation around interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In a statement on Friday, June 20, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said tariffs were having a minimal impact on inflation and that he would support a rate cut in July. On Monday, Fed official Michele Bowman echoed a similar view, further fueling market optimism. Further, Bitcoin ( BTC ) demand continues rising as spot ETFs added over $350 million in assets on Monday. Bitcoin supply on exchanges has fallen to an eight-year low. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish signal that could trigger a broader crypto rally. You might also like: Surprise Fed statement sparks hopes of Bitcoin and altcoin rally Top altcoins to buy if a crypto bull run happens The best altcoins to consider during a bull run are those with strong fundamentals and promising technical setups. Among the top candidates are Binance Coin ( BNB ), Morpho ( MORPHO ), and Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ). Aerodrome Finance Aerodrome Finance is a leading altcoin to watch due to its dominance on the Base network. It is now the largest decentralized exchange on Base and the fourth-largest in the entire DeFi ecosystem. Over the past 24 hours, Aerodrome handled $614 million in trading volume, with a 30-day total of $14.2 billion. AERO’s volume is expected to surge further once it is integrated into Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange. This likely explains growing interest from smart money investors. According to Nansen data , AERO tokens worth $155,000 were purchased in the last 24 hours by these investors. Morpho Morpho is another strong candidate thanks to its rapidly expanding footprint on the Base network. Its total value locked has surged more than 16% in the past 30 days, climbing to over $4.19 billion. Morpho’s momentum accelerated after it was integrated into Coinbase’s platform, enabling users to borrow against their Bitcoin holdings. Like AERO, smart money investors are accumulating MORPHO ahead of a potential bull run, with over $300,000 in token purchases recorded in the last 24 hours. Binance Coin BNB remains a top altcoin pick thanks to its robust fundamentals. The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) has become the largest player in the DEX ecosystem, processing over $159 billion in transactions over the past 30 days—more than Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Base, combined. BSC is also a major force in the stablecoin sector, with over $335 billion in volume over the same period. Stablecoin wallet addresses on BSC have jumped by 187% in the last 30 days, reaching 11.5 million. BNB is also highly deflationary, with more than $1 billion in tokens burned each quarter. The long-term goal is to reduce the circulating supply from over 140 million tokens today to 100 million.

2025-06-24T12:50:32,"Bitcoin Millionaire Shares His Top 5 Altcoin Picks to Grow a $25M Crypto Portfolio – Meme Coins Dominate","A notable Bitcoin investor has revealed his top five alternative cryptocurrencies chosen to boost a $25 million digital asset portfolio. Surprisingly, meme coins make up a significant part of his picks, highlighting a possible shift in market dynamics. This disclosure sheds light on emerging opportunities and trends within the cryptocurrency space. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Crypto Phenomenon – What's Next? Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer created it to bring some fun to the serious world of cryptocurrencies. They used the popular Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There's no cap on how many can exist, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin's value skyrocketed in 2021. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, surpassing $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk. It showcased the power of community and how online trends can impact financial markets. Dogecoin's potential lies in its active community and widespread recognition. Its technology allows for fast and low-cost transactions. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as an attractive opportunity, especially for those looking for quick gains. However, its unlimited supply could affect its value over time. Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have advanced features and clear use cases, Dogecoin is more speculative. Market trends show that meme coins can rise and fall quickly. While Dogecoin has made waves, investors should consider the volatility of the crypto market. It's important to stay informed and approach such investments with caution. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That's More Than Just a Cute Dog Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment inspired by Dogecoin. But it's not just a copycat. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with a wide range of apps and services on Ethereum. Created in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB began with a huge number of tokens—one quadrillion! Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large amount to help with COVID-19 relief in India and burned (destroyed) 40% of the total supply. This brought a lot of attention to SHIB. What makes SHIB interesting is its potential beyond being a meme coin. Because it's on Ethereum, developers have built ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade tokens without a middleman. They're also planning a platform for NFTs (digital collectibles) and a system where holders can help make decisions for the community. These developments could give SHIB more uses and value. In today's market, where people are looking for cryptocurrencies with real-world applications, SHIB's growth and active community might make it an attractive option compared to other meme coins. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Revitalizing the Solana Ecosystem BONK is the latest memecoin making waves in the crypto world. Built on the Solana blockchain, it features a cheerful Shiba Inu mascot and a mission to empower the community. Unlike many tokens dominated by venture capitalists, BONK aims to redistribute power by airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana's NFT and DeFi participants. This strategy has spurred significant interest, leading to a surge of over 100% following its listing on Coinbase. Despite the challenges of a large total supply and the wild swings common to memecoins, BONK shows promise. It’s integrating deeply into the growing Solana ecosystem, with initiatives like launching BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. This involvement in decentralized applications positions BONK as more than just a fleeting trend. In the current market cycle, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option for those interested in the blending of memes and meaningful blockchain development. From Meme to Millions: The Rise of PEPE Coin in the Crypto World PEPE Coin is making waves in the crypto community. Born on the Ethereum platform, it's a deflationary memecoin inspired by Pepe the Frog, a popular internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. In a stunning surge between April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, and a strong community of enthusiasts grew around the coin. This phenomenon sparked what's being called a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme-based cryptocurrencies popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. It stands out by having no taxes and embracing its role as a pure memecoin without pretense of utility. With a roadmap that includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a ""meme takeover,"" PEPE is positioning itself for growth. The upcoming Bitcoin halving has traders hopeful for a market upswing, and some believe PEPE could ride that wave to new highs. Whether it's an attractive investment now depends on one's appetite for risk in the volatile world of memecoins. As trends evolve, PEPE could either fade away or become the next big thing in crypto. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE are strong picks, XYZVerse (XYZ) leads with its sports-meme fusion, aiming for 20,000% growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

Bitcoin Holders Take Note! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is making headlines again after a strong 5% jump overnight, rising from $100,750 to nearly $105,780. At the time of writing, it’s holding steady around $105,215 – bringing fresh energy to the crypto market. Right on cue, Bitcoin advocate and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor shared a cryptic tweet that’s sparking curiosity across the crypto space. Saylor’s “Land’s End” Post: A Call to Think Long-Term? Saylor posted an AI-generated image of himself at Land’s End, a well-known coastal spot in the U.K., wearing his signature orange tie (a nod to Bitcoin) and standing by a black car. The caption simply read, “Meet me at Land’s End.” While brief, the message feels symbolic. Land’s End is known for its sweeping views and rugged cliffs, the kind of place you go to take it all in. That could be Saylor’s subtle way of encouraging Bitcoin holders to zoom out and think long term. Watch the markets like a tourist, don’t panic like a participant. The post came just after Bitcoin’s rally – a move likely linked to easing tensions in the Middle East. It fits Saylor’s consistent message: hold onto Bitcoin, no matter what. In his eyes, it’s digital gold built to weather storms. Meet me at Land’s End. pic.twitter.com/hZVlp4T28C — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 24, 2025 Strategy Adds $26M in Bitcoin Adding weight to Saylor’s message, Strategy revealed it had bought another 245 BTC this Monday, spending around $26 million. That brings the company’s total holdings to a massive 592,345 BTC, worth about $62.28 billion at current prices. This follows last week’s huge buy of 10,100 BTC for $1 billion. With each purchase, Strategy is cementing its position as one of the biggest institutional holders of Bitcoin. It also reflects Saylor’s strong belief that Bitcoin will continue to outperform in the long run- regardless of short-term market noise or global events. Bitcoin’s Bounce: A Sign of What’s to Come? The recent price surge shows just how quickly Bitcoin can react to global developments. As military tensions cool in the Middle East, investor confidence appears to be returning. Bitcoin’s quick bounce back has sparked talk of a potential new rally. With Saylor doubling down and Strategy continuing to stack, the message is clear: the bulls are not backing off. The crypto crowd is now watching closely to see if Bitcoin can build on this momentum in the days ahead.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/what-does-michael-saylors-viral-lands-end-tweet-mean-bitcoin-holders-take-note/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek shared an article on X by state-owned Anadolu news agency, saying Turkey plans to set limits on transfers and introduce waiting periods for crypto withdrawals. Translated post of Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek. Source: Mehmet Şimşek (X/Twitter) According to the report , withdrawals will face a 48 to 72-hour delay if the so-called travel rule is not applied. “We are taking new steps to prevent the laundering of criminal proceeds obtained from illegal betting and fraud through cryptocurrency transactions,” Şimşek said. He added, “In addition to administrative sanctions, various legal and financial penalties, including denial or cancellation of license, may be imposed on platforms that do not comply with the new regulations.” Anadolu said stablecoin transfer will be capped at $3,000 a day and $50,000 a month to curb fast outflows of illicit funds, although platforms meeting full travel-rule checks can offer twice those limits. The travel rule requires providers to verify and share details about both the sender and the recipient of a virtual asset transfer. The finance ministry also aims to force crypto platforms to record where funds come from and why they move, Anadolu news agency said. Crypto platforms in Turkey to impose withdrawal delays Under the plan, users must give a transaction note of at least 20 characters for every transfer. Platforms also have to enforce a 48-hour hold for most withdrawals and a 72-hour wait on a user’s first withdrawal when the travel rule does not apply. These measures form part of a wider crackdown by the Treasury and Finance Ministry to boost its oversight of crypto asset service providers. Şimşek told the Anadolu news agency that the goal is to curb criminal misuse without stopping lawful crypto activity. “Left-wing space for legitimate crypto asset activities will be maintained,” he said. The ministry says the changes will take effect soon. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-24T12:40:45,"Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 20: A Critical Shift to Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 20: A Critical Shift to Bitcoin Season The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with shifts and trends, and one of the most keenly watched indicators for market sentiment is the Altcoin Season Index . Recently, this crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a significant drop to 20 at 00:39 UTC on June 24. This notable decline, up six points from the previous day’s figure, isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal that the broader crypto market is firmly entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this shift can be a game-changer, influencing portfolio strategies and highlighting where the smart money might be flowing. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 20 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a random figure; it’s a barometer designed to gauge the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure market view, offers insights into whether altcoins are collectively outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is dominating the market. A score of 20, as we’ve recently seen, places us squarely in Bitcoin Season territory. But what are the exact thresholds? Let’s break down how this index works: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a staggering 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This period typically sees massive gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day timeframe. A score of 20 indicates that very few altcoins are keeping pace with or surpassing Bitcoin’s performance. Neutral Zone: Scores between these two extremes suggest a more balanced or indecisive market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a clear, dominant lead. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Therefore, a score of 20 is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s current strength and the relative weakness in broader altcoin performance . Why the Shift? Unpacking the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance The move into Bitcoin Season isn’t arbitrary; it’s often a reflection of broader market dynamics and investor sentiment. Several factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance: Flight to Safety: In times of economic uncertainty or heightened volatility within the crypto space, investors often flock to Bitcoin. It’s perceived as the “digital gold” – a more stable and established asset compared to the often volatile and less liquid altcoins. Institutional Inflows: The approval and increasing adoption of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have significantly opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These large-scale investments tend to flow primarily into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and market capitalization while altcoins may see comparatively less interest. Halving Cycle Influence: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant bull runs. While the immediate effects can vary, the long-term narrative often strengthens Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events can all play a role. When traditional markets face headwinds, Bitcoin can sometimes act as a hedge, attracting capital away from riskier assets, including altcoins. This period of Bitcoin dominance suggests that capital is consolidating around the largest cryptocurrency, indicating a more cautious or foundational phase in the crypto market cycle. Investors are prioritizing stability and proven track records over the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of smaller cap altcoins. Impact on Altcoin Performance: Navigating the Challenges For investors heavily invested in altcoins, a prolonged Bitcoin Season can present significant challenges. While Bitcoin might be experiencing steady gains, many altcoins could see their values stagnate or even decline against BTC. This is not to say all altcoins will suffer equally; some may still find niche rallies, but the overall trend favors Bitcoin. What does this mean for your altcoin performance ? Decreased Liquidity: Capital flowing into Bitcoin often means less liquidity for altcoins, making it harder to enter or exit positions without impacting prices significantly. Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin’s USD value remains stable or increases slightly, its value relative to Bitcoin might decrease. This means you could have held Bitcoin and seen better returns. Increased Volatility for Some: Smaller, less established altcoins can experience heightened volatility during Bitcoin Season, as they are more susceptible to market sentiment shifts and lower trading volumes. Focus on Fundamentals: This period often serves as a “stress test” for altcoin projects. Those with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility are more likely to weather the storm and potentially emerge stronger when altcoin season eventually returns. It’s crucial for investors to understand that this isn’t necessarily a permanent state. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are often followed by periods where altcoins shine. However, knowing which phase we are in allows for more informed decision-making. Strategies for the Current Crypto Market: Thriving in Bitcoin Season So, with the Altcoin Season Index at 20, how can investors best position themselves in the current crypto market ? Adapting your strategy to the prevailing market conditions is key. Here are some actionable insights: Rebalance Towards Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin. If your portfolio is heavily skewed towards altcoins, rebalancing could help mitigate risk and capture the gains from Bitcoin’s dominance. Research Strong Altcoin Projects: While the overall altcoin market might be struggling, this is an excellent time to research projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and clear use cases. These “gems” might be undervalued during Bitcoin Season and could offer significant returns when altcoin season returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider dollar-cost averaging into your preferred assets. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, which can reduce the impact of volatility. Consider Stablecoins: If you’re highly risk-averse, temporarily parking some capital in stablecoins can be a way to preserve capital while waiting for clearer market signals or more favorable altcoin conditions. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D). An increasing dominance suggests Bitcoin Season is in full swing, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of an altcoin resurgence. Risk Management is Paramount: Always use stop-loss orders and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and disciplined risk management is essential. Understanding the nuances of Bitcoin dominance and its implications for altcoin performance allows for a more strategic approach to investment, helping you navigate the ebbs and flows of the digital asset landscape. Is Altcoin Season Over? A Look at Future Possibilities The question on many investors’ minds is: “Is Altcoin Season truly over, or is this just a temporary pause?” The truth is, the crypto market is cyclical. While we are currently in a strong Bitcoin Season , history suggests that periods of Bitcoin dominance are often followed by periods where altcoins experience explosive growth. This cycle is driven by several factors: Profit Rotation: As Bitcoin’s price rises, investors who made significant gains often look to rotate those profits into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. This influx of capital can ignite altcoin rallies. Innovation and Narrative Shifts: New technologies, emerging narratives (e.g., AI, DePIN, Gaming), and breakthroughs within the altcoin space can attract fresh capital and spark renewed interest, regardless of Bitcoin’s immediate performance. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, more diverse use cases for altcoins emerge, attracting different types of investors and expanding the overall market capitalization beyond just Bitcoin. While the Altcoin Season Index is currently at 20, it doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant. It simply means that for the time being, Bitcoin is leading the charge. Smart investors use this period to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices, preparing for the eventual return of the altcoin boom. The key is to remain patient, continue your research, and understand that market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. The shift from Bitcoin dominance back to broader altcoin performance is often signaled by a decrease in Bitcoin Dominance and an increase in the Altcoin Season Index. Conclusion: Adapting to the Shifting Crypto Tides The recent drop of the Altcoin Season Index to 20 is a definitive indicator that the crypto market is currently navigating a period of strong Bitcoin Season . This phase, characterized by Bitcoin dominance and a challenging environment for overall altcoin performance , calls for a strategic reassessment of investment portfolios. While it may feel daunting for altcoin holders, it’s a natural and recurring part of the market cycle. By understanding the underlying reasons for this shift – from institutional inflows to macroeconomic factors – investors can make more informed decisions. Instead of viewing this as a setback, consider it an opportunity to refine your strategy: prioritize risk management, rebalance portfolios, and focus on fundamental analysis for promising altcoin projects. The crypto market is dynamic, and adapting to its changing tides is crucial for long-term success. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, the cyclical nature of the market suggests that altcoin season will eventually return, rewarding those who prepared wisely during the current phase.

2025-06-24T12:40:09,"One of the Most Hawkish FED Members, Bowman, Made a Statement: He Gave the Green Light to Cut Interest Rates! He Also Gave a Date!","While the FED is expected to start cutting interest rates, which it has been pausing since January, in order to trigger the long-awaited rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, which have been overshadowed by the Israel-Iran tension, the good news of an interest rate cut came from FED Vice Chair Michelle Bowman. Speaking at a meeting in Prague, Czech Republic, Michelle Bowman Waller said the time to cut interest rates was approaching. This marks a major change for Bowman, who has emerged as one of the most hawkish members and has been skeptical of interest rate cuts in recent months. But Bowman now made an unexpected change by saying, “It's time to think about adjusting the policy rate.” Michelle Bowman pointed out that inflation has slowed in recent months and said she would support a rate cut in July if the slowing trend in inflation continues. “Recent economic data suggest that tariffs and other policies have no clear and significant impact on inflation. At this point, the impact of the trade war on inflation may be delayed or less significant than expected. “Therefore, if the downtrend continues, I would support a rate cut next month. In the meantime, I will continue to monitor economic conditions carefully as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.” Bowman's comments echo those of his colleague Christopher Waller, who told CNBC on Friday that he thought the Fed could cut interest rates in July. Related News: Interest Rate Good News from a FED Member! Will We See a Summer Rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins? US President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates as a way to save on financing the country’s rising national debt. However, the Fed left the interest rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% at its meeting last week. While Trump thinks the Fed should cut interest rates by at least 2 percent, Bowman did not say how much the interest rate should be lowered. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. According to the CME FedWatch indicator, investors are pricing in a 22.7 percent chance of a rate cut in July and expecting rates to remain steady. However, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in September is priced in at about 78.7 percent. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T12:39:22,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $105,000 After President Trump Announces Israel-Iran Ceasefire","Bitcoin (BTC) made a strong recovery on Monday after spending the weekend in the doldrums as market sentiment worsened. The flagship cryptocurrency plummeted to multi-month lows after the US conducted airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, as the conflict between Israel and Iran threatened to spiral out of control. However, market sentiment turned positive after President Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% on Monday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. President Trump Announces Israel-Iran Ceasefire US President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a full ceasefire, set to begin in a few hours. The ceasefire halts what Trump referred to as “The 12-Day War” in a post on Truth Social. Trump stated that the ceasefire would unfold in two phases, with Iran observing the first 12 hours, followed by Israel. Trump also added that Iran had notified the US about the attack on its military base in Qatar and that there were no casualties. “CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in-progress, final missions!), for 12 hours at which point the war will be considered, ENDED!” The ceasefire follows a significant escalation in hostilities over the weekend as both countries intensified air attacks. The US also joined the conflict and conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Saylor Hints At Next Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Strategy, has hinted at the company’s next purchase. Saylor posted a chart highlighting Strategy’s previous Bitcoin acquisitions on X, alongside a caption stating, “Nothing Stops This Orange.” Saylor typically posts cryptic posts before a major Bitcoin purchase. Under his leadership, Strategy has established itself as the largest corporate holder of the asset, amassing 592,100 BTC worth around $60 billion at current prices. Saylor’s latest post came after an investor sued him, Strategy, and top company executives, claiming they breached their fiduciary duties before reporting a multi-billion dollar Bitcoin loss in Q1 results. According to the shareholder derivative complaint filed by Abhey Parmar in a Virginia federal court, Saylor, Strategy CEO Phong Le, financial chief Andrew Kang, and four board directors made materially false and misleading statements about an accounting practice change. According to the complainant, Strategy enacted a Financial Accounting Standards board rule that allowed corporate holders of crypto to use the estimated market value of their crypto in their balance sheets.

The merger is expected to close before the end of the year, according to a statement released by both companies. Pompliano will lead the new firm once it goes public. The crypto entrepreneur stated that ProCap will focus on acquiring BTC for its balance sheet and develop products and services to generate revenue. “Today, I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial service. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC , LLC, and Columbus Circle Capital Corp I, a publicly traded SPAC. ProCap Financial will focus on acquiring bitcoin for its balance sheet while also developing products and services to produce revenue and profit from the bitcoin on our balance sheet over time.” ProCap will join several other companies that buy and hold Bitcoin, a business model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. ProCap’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of BTC will place its holdings as the eighth-largest among public firms. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week positively as bullish sentiment returned after President Trump announced that Israel and Iran announced a complete ceasefire. The flagship cryptocurrency spent the weekend in the red as market sentiment worsened, thanks to the unfolding crisis in the Middle East.

SUI ( SUI ), the native token of the Sui layer-1 blockchain, has been on the rise in recent hours, posting roughly 15% in fresh gains. The rally marks the end of a month-long losing streak that saw the token break key support levels and drop to new lows. At press time, SUI trades around $2.79, marking a strong recovery from the week’s low of $2.45. The rebound in the native token is not isolated and comes as investor sentiment improves across the broader crypto market amid easing geopolitical tensions.

Since then, the price has recovered slightly and is now resting at $2.79, a price right on the edge of the trend lines that can be seen on the chart.

2025-06-24T12:20:43,"Japan’s FSA eyes crypto reclassification under FIEA to lower capital gains tax to 20%","Japan’s Financial Services Agency considers reclassifying crypto assets as financial products under Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which would reduce capital gains tax on crypto to a flat 20%. On June 24, Japan’s Financial Services Agency released a new policy proposal signaling a major regulatory transformation for cryptocurrencies, as initially reported by Coinpost. In a document titled “Review of the Systems Surrounding Crypto Assets,” the FSA announced the formation of a working group to explore the possibility of shifting crypto regulation from the current Payment Services Act to the more stringent FIEA. The proposal is set to be discussed at the Financial System Council’s plenary session on June 25. If approved, the change would introduce a flat capital gains tax rate of around 20% for crypto, putting it on par with stocks and easing the tax burden compared to the current tax regime, where rates can reach up to 55%. Beyond tax relief, the proposal paves the way for potential domestic Bitcoin ETFs. You might also like: Japan’s FSA introduces new framework that divides crypto into two categories This move is integral to Japan’s broader strategy to bolster its status as an investment nation and promote growth in the Web3 and crypto sectors. As outlined in the government’s revised 2025 “New Capitalism Grand Design and Implementation Plan,” the responsible development of Web3 businesses can tackle societal challenges, boost productivity, and unlock global opportunities for Japanese cultural and regional assets. Additionally, this potential regulatory shift also aligns with Japan’s ongoing efforts to refine how digital assets are classified and governed. In a separate but related move, the FSA recently introduced a draft framework dividing crypto assets into two categories based on their purpose and decentralization. Type 1 tokens, which are issued for business or fundraising purposes, would face stricter disclosure rules to protect investors. In contrast, Type 2 assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), seen as decentralized and non-fundraising, would be monitored primarily through exchange oversight. Meanwhile, Japan is rapidly advancing its digital financial ecosystem, with the digital yen pilot program— initiated in 2023—fully underway.

2025-06-24T12:20:35,"Bitcoin Treasury’s Transformative Merger: Eyeing a Major TSXV Listing","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury’s Transformative Merger: Eyeing a Major TSXV Listing The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a recent announcement from Bitcoin Treasury Corporation is set to make significant waves. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a pivotal moment that signals maturity and strategic growth within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin Treasury has officially completed a major amalgamation, a move that not only reshapes its corporate structure but also paves the way for a highly anticipated TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) listing. For anyone tracking the pulse of digital asset investment, this development is nothing short of compelling. What’s Next for Bitcoin Treasury After its Landmark Merger? In a strategic move that underscores its commitment to expansion and market presence, Bitcoin Treasury Corporation has successfully finalized its previously announced amalgamation. This significant corporate action involved merging with 2680083 Alberta Ltd., creating a unified entity that will continue to operate under the well-recognized Bitcoin Treasury name and business. This ensures continuity while leveraging the strengths of both parties. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the integration was seamless, allowing the merged company to immediately focus on its ambitious future plans. This amalgamation is more than just a corporate restructuring; it’s a foundational step. By consolidating operations and assets, Bitcoin Treasury aims to enhance its operational efficiency, streamline its strategic initiatives, and solidify its position within the competitive digital asset landscape. This move is designed to create a more robust and agile organization, better equipped to navigate the dynamic market conditions inherent in blockchain finance. Why is a TSXV Listing a Game-Changer for Digital Asset Investment? Perhaps the most exciting development following the merger is Bitcoin Treasury’s submission of a listing application to the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) for its common shares. While final approval is pending, this step represents a monumental leap for a company deeply embedded in the digital asset space. A TSXV listing offers several compelling advantages: Increased Visibility and Legitimacy: Listing on a recognized public exchange like the TSXV provides a significant boost in credibility and visibility. It opens the doors to a broader base of traditional investors, including institutional funds, who might otherwise be hesitant to engage directly with private crypto ventures. Enhanced Liquidity: Public trading typically leads to greater liquidity for the company’s shares, making it easier for investors to buy and sell. This can attract more capital and improve market efficiency. Access to Capital Markets: A public listing provides a more structured and accessible pathway for future capital raises, enabling the company to fund further growth and innovation without relying solely on private placements. Regulatory Oversight: Operating under the purview of a regulated exchange brings a layer of transparency and governance that can instill greater confidence among investors, distinguishing the company from less regulated entities in the crypto sphere. The journey to a full TSXV listing involves rigorous due diligence and compliance with exchange requirements. The successful completion of this process would not only be a triumph for Bitcoin Treasury but also a significant milestone for the broader acceptance of digital asset investment within traditional financial markets. How Does This Crypto Merger Impact the Broader Blockchain Finance Landscape? The amalgamation of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation and 2680083 Alberta Ltd. is a prime example of a growing trend: consolidation within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. This particular crypto merger highlights a strategic response to market maturation, where companies seek to combine resources, expertise, and market share to achieve greater scale and resilience. Such mergers can lead to: Synergistic Operations: Combining two entities can result in shared technologies, reduced operational costs, and integrated teams that foster innovation. Stronger Market Position: A larger, more capitalized entity often holds a stronger competitive advantage, capable of undertaking larger projects and attracting top talent. Paving the Way for Others: Successful mergers and subsequent public listings set a precedent, potentially encouraging other private crypto companies to pursue similar paths towards traditional financial markets. This crypto merger isn’t just about the entities involved; it signals a broader shift towards more mature, institutionally-friendly structures in the digital asset space. It reflects a desire for stability and long-term growth, moving beyond the speculative early days of crypto. Fueling Growth: The $120 Million Digital Asset Investment Behind Bitcoin Treasury A crucial element of Bitcoin Treasury’s recent success and future ambitions is the substantial capital raised in conjunction with the transaction. The company secured approximately $120 million through a strategic combination of equity and convertible debenture offerings. This significant digital asset investment speaks volumes about investor confidence in Bitcoin Treasury’s vision and its position in the evolving blockchain finance ecosystem. Let’s briefly break down what these funding mechanisms mean: Equity Offerings: This involves selling ownership stakes (shares) in the company to investors. It provides direct capital without incurring debt, but it dilutes existing ownership. Convertible Debenture Offerings: These are a type of loan (debt) that can be converted into equity (shares) at a predetermined price or under specific conditions. They offer flexibility, providing initial debt financing with the potential for investors to participate in future equity upside. The successful raise of such a substantial sum in the current economic climate is a testament to the perceived value and potential of Bitcoin Treasury’s business model. This capital infusion will undoubtedly be instrumental in funding operational expansion, technological development, and strategic acquisitions, propelling the company forward as a key player in digital asset investment. Pioneering the Future: Bitcoin Treasury’s Role in Blockchain Finance With its merger complete, a TSXV listing on the horizon, and a significant capital injection, Bitcoin Treasury is positioning itself as a vanguard in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain finance . This company’s trajectory offers a compelling case study for how digital asset entities are maturing and integrating with traditional financial systems. Their strategy reflects a broader trend of institutionalization within crypto, where robust corporate governance, transparent financial reporting, and access to mainstream capital markets are becoming increasingly vital. Bitcoin Treasury’s journey exemplifies the bridge being built between innovative blockchain technologies and established financial frameworks. For those observing the future of finance, keeping an eye on how Bitcoin Treasury leverages its new structure and capital will offer valuable insights into the direction of blockchain finance . A New Chapter Unfolds The recent developments at Bitcoin Treasury Corporation mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter. The successful amalgamation, the pursuit of a TSXV listing, and the impressive $120 million capital raise collectively paint a picture of a company poised for significant growth and influence. As Bitcoin Treasury navigates its path towards public markets, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for other digital asset firms seeking to integrate into the global financial landscape. This is a story of ambition, strategic execution, and the undeniable convergence of traditional finance with the innovative power of blockchain.

2025-06-24T12:15:40,"US federal housing to look into crypto assets in mortgage qualifications - Bill Pulte","According to an announcement made on Monday by its new director, Bill Pulte, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) will begin a formal review of how crypto holdings could be factored into mortgage qualification processes. The 37-year-old businessman turned policymaker, sworn in as FHFA director on March 14 after being nominated by President Donald Trump, made the announcement via social media. “ We will study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages ,” he posted on X. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 The FHFA oversees most parameters of the US housing market, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. It could push traditional mortgage lenders who have largely excluded crypto holdings from eligibility calculations to start accepting digital assets from homebuyers. Pulte pushes for crypto-backed house mortgages Pulte is the founder of Pulte Capital Partners and the grandson of William Pulte, who founded Pulte Homes, currently the third-largest homebuilder in the United States. His financial disclosures earlier this year revealed that he holds between $500,001 and $1,000,000 each in Bitcoin and Solana. The crypto-related investments also include shares in Marathon Digital Holdings , now rebranded as MARA, the well-known US-based bitcoin mining company. The portfolio also carries meme stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond, and shares in Tesla, Palantir, and ventures linked to YouTube celebrity MrBeast. Pulte made his first crypto purchase of 11 BTC in 2019, in which he later pledged to give away crypto to followers on X, although the post is now de l eted . He is also a known supporter of Donald Trump’s political campaign, having donated $6,600 to the president’s 2024 re-election bid, along with contributions to Save America PAC and the Republican National Committee, according to filings by OpenSecrets. Crypto could be considered in mortgage lending Under current lending standards, most US mortgage providers do not accept direct crypto payments like Bitcoin or Ethereum to service home loans. Yet, proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies can be used for down payments or to cover closing costs, provided the funds can be verified and documented. Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at HomeAbroad, notes that lenders prioritize the stability and traceability of funds. “ The lender needs to see that your funds are stable and not borrowed ,” Glick said. He explained that borrowers must convert their crypto holdings to US dollars through recognized exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken, then transfer the proceeds to a conventional bank account. Andrew Lokenauth, a personal finance consultant, explained to the Mortgage Research Network about a client who successfully converted $100,000 in Ethereum into a mortgage down payment. “ We documented every step, including the sale on Coinbase, the transfer to his bank, and two months of statements showing the money remained there ,” Lokenauth said. “ The rule of thumb is that a clean paper trail equals a happy mortgage underwriter. ” Documentation must include transaction records from the crypto exchange, deposit confirmations from the bank, and at least 60 days of “seasoning” where funds remain untouched. Lenders may also require evidence that the crypto was not obtained through a loan or margin account to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. “ If you can’t prove it, in the lender’s eyes you don’t own it ,” insisted mortgage advisor Cooling, reiterating that undocumented funds could disqualify a borrower. Outside of traditional banking, a group of crypto lenders could soon begin offering mortgage services based on digital assets. Thomas Franklin, CEO and founder of Swapped.com, a crypto brokerage firm, reckons the “fear” over crypto mortgages is often exaggerated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-24T12:10:56,"Unlocking Your Home: How Cryptocurrency Holdings Could Transform Mortgage Qualification","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Your Home: How Cryptocurrency Holdings Could Transform Mortgage Qualification Are you a cryptocurrency enthusiast dreaming of owning a home? The recent announcement from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) might just be the news you’ve been waiting for, or at least, a significant step towards clarity. William Pulte, Director of the FHFA, recently shared on X that the agency is embarking on a crucial study to understand how cryptocurrency holdings impact an individual’s eligibility for mortgages. This isn’t just a fleeting headline; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine how digital assets are viewed in the traditional financial landscape, especially concerning mortgage qualification . What’s Driving the FHFA Crypto Policy Study? The FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – two giants in the U.S. housing finance market – plays a pivotal role in setting standards for mortgage lending. When Director Pulte announced the agency’s intention to delve into FHFA crypto policy , it signaled a recognition of the growing presence of digital assets in the financial portfolios of many Americans. For years, crypto holders have faced a unique hurdle when applying for home loans: how do lenders assess assets that are volatile, largely unregulated, and often held outside traditional banking systems? This study is a direct response to the evolving financial landscape. As more people accumulate significant wealth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the disconnect between their digital assets and their ability to qualify for a conventional mortgage has become increasingly apparent. The FHFA’s move suggests a proactive approach to bridge this gap, aiming to develop a more comprehensive and fair framework for evaluating these modern forms of wealth. The agency’s primary goal will likely be to understand the risks and opportunities associated with including crypto assets in mortgage underwriting. This includes addressing concerns around price volatility, regulatory compliance, and the liquidity of various digital assets. By initiating this study, the FHFA is taking a crucial step towards potentially integrating digital wealth into the mainstream housing finance system, a development that could have profound implications for millions. The FHFA’s groundbreaking study could reshape the future of homeownership for crypto holders. How Might Cryptocurrency Mortgages Evolve? Currently, using cryptocurrency mortgages as direct collateral or as proof of funds for a home loan is a complex and often prohibitive process. Traditional lenders prefer stable, easily verifiable assets like fiat currency in bank accounts, stocks, or bonds. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a risky proposition for lenders who need assurance that a borrower’s assets will maintain their value over the loan term. However, the FHFA study could pave the way for new approaches. Imagine a future where your Bitcoin holdings, perhaps converted into a stablecoin or held in a regulated trust, could contribute directly to your down payment or serve as a recognized asset for your loan application. This evolution wouldn’t happen overnight, but the study is the first critical step. Here’s a simplified comparison of how mortgage assessments might look today versus a potential future where crypto is integrated: Aspect Current Mortgage Assessment (Typical) Potential Future Mortgage Assessment (with Crypto Integration) Recognized Assets Bank deposits, stocks, bonds, retirement accounts. Traditional assets PLUS regulated crypto holdings (e.g., stablecoins, tokenized assets, verifiable exchange balances). Income Verification W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements showing consistent income. Traditional income verification PLUS potentially verifiable crypto-derived income (e.g., staking rewards, DeFi yields, with clear tax records). Risk Assessment Credit score, debt-to-income ratio, stable asset valuation. Traditional metrics PLUS new frameworks for assessing crypto volatility and liquidity risk, potentially requiring specific types of crypto or holding periods. Collateral Options Primarily the property itself. Property PLUS potentially certain crypto assets as supplementary collateral, perhaps with higher loan-to-value (LTV) requirements or specific risk mitigations. This potential shift could open up homeownership to a segment of the population that has been effectively locked out due to their wealth being primarily in digital form. It signifies a move towards financial inclusivity, acknowledging modern wealth creation methods. Understanding the Crypto Impact on Mortgages: Challenges and Opportunities The crypto impact on mortgages is multifaceted, presenting both significant hurdles and exciting possibilities. Addressing these will be central to the FHFA’s study. Challenges: Price Volatility: The most obvious challenge. How can a lender rely on an asset that can fluctuate 20% or more in a single day? The study will need to explore mechanisms to mitigate this risk, perhaps through requiring higher reserves, using stablecoins, or implementing dynamic collateral adjustments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, comprehensive federal regulation for cryptocurrencies poses a significant hurdle. Lenders need clear guidelines on anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and how to handle crypto assets in the event of default or bankruptcy. Valuation and Custody: Accurately valuing diverse crypto assets, especially less liquid ones, is complex. Furthermore, secure custody solutions that are recognized and trusted by traditional financial institutions are essential. Source of Funds Verification: Lenders are legally obligated to verify the legitimate source of funds for down payments. Crypto transactions, especially those involving peer-to-peer transfers or older wallets, can be difficult to trace and verify to the stringent standards required for mortgage lending. Opportunities: Expanded Borrower Pool: Acknowledging crypto wealth could significantly expand the pool of eligible homebuyers, especially among younger generations who have embraced digital assets. Innovation in Lending: This could spur innovation in lending products, potentially leading to hybrid mortgages that blend traditional and crypto-backed elements, or even decentralized finance (DeFi) lending models that integrate with traditional real estate. Alternative Collateral: For borrowers with substantial crypto holdings but limited traditional liquid assets, their digital wealth could serve as supplementary collateral, potentially lowering interest rates or improving loan terms. Efficiency Gains: In the long term, if crypto rails are used for parts of the mortgage process (e.g., smart contracts for escrow), it could lead to faster, more transparent, and more efficient transactions. Navigating Mortgage Qualification Crypto: Actionable Insights for Homebuyers While the FHFA study is underway, crypto holders shouldn’t wait passively. Understanding how to best position your assets for future mortgage qualification crypto opportunities is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Maintain Meticulous Records: Document every crypto transaction, including purchase dates, prices, and sources. This includes exchange statements, wallet histories, and any relevant tax forms. Transparency and verifiable records will be paramount. Understand Tax Implications: Ensure you are fully compliant with all tax regulations regarding your crypto holdings and any gains. Lenders will scrutinize your financial history, and clear tax records demonstrate financial responsibility. Consider “Seasoning” Your Crypto: If you anticipate using crypto for a down payment, consider converting a portion into fiat currency and holding it in a traditional bank account for several months (typically 60-90 days, known as “seasoning”). This makes the funds appear more stable and verifiable to lenders. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek advice from a financial professional who understands both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. They can help you structure your assets in a way that maximizes your chances of mortgage approval in the current and future landscapes. Stay Informed: Follow updates from the FHFA and other regulatory bodies. The outcome of this study will directly influence future mortgage guidelines. Build a Strong Credit Profile: Regardless of your crypto holdings, a robust credit score and a low debt-to-income ratio remain fundamental to mortgage qualification. By taking these proactive steps, you can better prepare yourself for a future where your digital assets might play a more direct role in your homeownership journey. The Future of Digital Asset Home Loans The FHFA’s study marks a significant turning point for digital asset home loans . While the immediate outcome is uncertain, the very act of undertaking this study signals a growing acceptance and seriousness with which traditional finance views cryptocurrencies. We could see several potential scenarios unfold: One possibility is the introduction of specific guidelines for how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should consider crypto assets. This might involve requiring crypto to be held with regulated custodians, specific seasoning periods, or limits on the percentage of crypto assets that can contribute to a down payment. Another outcome could be pilot programs that test new lending models, perhaps involving stablecoins as collateral or using blockchain technology for more efficient property title transfers. In the long term, this initiative could accelerate the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into the broader real estate and lending ecosystems. Imagine tokenized real estate, where fractional ownership is facilitated by blockchain, or mortgages executed via smart contracts, reducing intermediaries and costs. While these are more futuristic visions, the FHFA’s current study lays the groundwork for such innovations by legitimizing the discussion around crypto and housing. This isn’t just about making it easier to buy a house with crypto; it’s about building a more inclusive and technologically advanced financial system that reflects the diverse ways individuals hold and manage their wealth in the 21st century. The study will undoubtedly lead to a more nuanced understanding of crypto’s role in personal finance, ultimately shaping policies that could benefit millions of aspiring homeowners. In conclusion, the FHFA’s decision to study the relationship between cryptocurrency holdings and mortgage qualification is a landmark event. It signifies a crucial step towards acknowledging digital assets within the traditional housing finance system. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, the potential benefits—from expanding the pool of eligible homebuyers to fostering innovation in lending—are immense. For crypto holders, this is a call to action: stay informed, meticulously document your assets, and prepare for a future where your digital wealth could genuinely unlock the door to your dream home. This study isn’t just about policy; it’s about progress, paving the way for a more integrated and accessible financial future for all.

The rally came after a ceasefire was announced to ease escalating geopolitical tensions. The price surge followed a turbulent weekend driven by U.S. and Israeli military activity on Iran, making it a bearish June’s third week. With Monday’s advancement, a new week has begun for the XRP price . XRP Price Prediction For Next 24 Hours Metric Price (USD) Reason 24H High $2.33 Projected strong resistance level; target if bullish momentum continues. 24H Low $2.08 Key support zone; losing this may break short-term bullish structure. 24H Average Price $2.20 – $2.23 Estimated average based on recovery from $1.90 and current range movement. XRP Price Dips to Monthly Low Amid Geopolitical Tensions The 3-hour chart displays the impact of recent geopolitical events that briefly pushed the XRP price below the key multi-day psychological support zone. As a result, XRP price marked June month’s low at $1.90 from $2.33, eroding 18%. However, the XRP crypto showed immediate recovery on June 23rd. When writing, the recovery from the “weak low” has pushed XRP price 14% higher to $2.18, with $5.15 billion 24-hour trading volume and $129.08 Billion market capitalization. The short-term recovery has changed the short-term trend as it has broken the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, and as a result, the short-term structure has attained a “Change of Character (ChoCh).” The reason behind the rise was a short-term bullish conviction developed by the ceasefire news. This is also evident on-chain, as whale transaction count has increased, and exchange outflow has spiked. This shows that investors have not panicked as much as they did in the last few months, which is evident in evaluating metrics like age consumed and network realized profit/loss. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What’s Next for XRP, ADA, and BTC Prices? , This indicates that a lot of buying on the dip happened, then panic selling, and it appears that the short-term rally is not over yet. 7% Move on the Horizon? Key Levels to Watch There are higher odds that in the next 24 hours, the continued “break of structure (BoS)” could take XRP price towards the short-term trend’s “strong high” at $2.33, which is a critical resistance level for tomorrow. While $2.08 would support tomorrow’s price action, retesting this support would shatter short-term bullish conviction, but if it rises, then a 7% big move is likely in the next 24 hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T12:00:52,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $350M Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $350M Inflow Surge The world of digital finance is currently witnessing an exhilarating phenomenon: the relentless surge of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. For an unprecedented tenth consecutive trading day, these groundbreaking investment vehicles have recorded substantial net inflows, culminating in a remarkable $350.48 million on June 23 alone. This sustained accumulation is not merely a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s burgeoning role in mainstream finance and a clear indicator of burgeoning institutional confidence. The Unstoppable Momentum of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A New Era for Digital Assets? The consistent performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has captured the attention of investors worldwide. This impressive streak of net inflows, now spanning ten trading days, signifies a pivotal shift in the investment landscape. What began as a niche asset for early adopters has rapidly evolved into a legitimate component of diversified portfolios, largely facilitated by the accessibility and regulatory clarity offered by these ETFs. This sustained accumulation points to several fundamental drivers: Institutional Validation: Major financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products, viewing them as a safer and more compliant entry point than direct cryptocurrency purchases. Ease of Access: For a vast segment of the investment community, particularly those operating under strict mandates or preferring traditional brokerage platforms, spot Bitcoin ETFs remove significant barriers to entry, simplifying exposure to the digital asset. Market Maturation: The consistent demand from institutional players contributes significantly to the overall maturation and stability of the cryptocurrency market, gradually reducing its perceived volatility and enhancing its appeal as a long-term store of value. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an era of persistent inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin’s narrative as a potential hedge against traditional financial system vulnerabilities continues to resonate with sophisticated investors. The cumulative effect of these factors is creating a robust demand environment for Bitcoin, with ETFs acting as the primary conduit for this institutional capital. Diving Deep into Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Who’s Leading the Charge in This Financial Revolution? A closer examination of the specific contributions to these monumental Bitcoin ETF inflows reveals a dynamic competitive landscape among the various fund providers. On June 23, the distribution of inflows highlighted clear market leaders: ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $217.65 million FBTC Fidelity $105.66 million BITB Bitwise $14.57 million BTC Grayscale (mini BTC) $10.06 million BTCO Invesco $6.18 million ARKB Ark Invest $2.05 million As the table illustrates, BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC continue to dominate, leveraging their brand recognition, extensive distribution networks, and competitive fee structures to attract the lion’s share of new capital. This strong performance by traditional financial powerhouses underscores the significant shift of institutional funds into the digital asset space. Understanding the Dynamics of BTC ETFs: Winners, Outliers, and Market Evolution While the overall trend for BTC ETFs is undeniably positive, it’s essential to analyze the nuances within the market. On June 23, one significant outlier was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $5.69 million. This outflow, while modest compared to the massive inflows into other funds, is part of a broader, ongoing trend for GBTC since its conversion from a trust to a spot ETF in January. Early investors, who previously faced limited redemption options, are now able to exit their positions, often migrating to newer, more cost-effective Bitcoin ETF alternatives. This dynamic is a natural consequence of increased competition and market maturity. The remaining ETFs in the market reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stability in their existing investor base. The emergence of these diverse ETF options has created a more competitive environment, ultimately benefiting investors by offering a range of choices with varying fee structures and management styles. BlackRock IBIT’s Dominance: A Closer Look at the Institutional Behemoth The consistent and overwhelming success of BlackRock IBIT in attracting significant capital is a defining narrative in the current Bitcoin ETF landscape. On June 23, IBIT alone accounted for over 60% of the total net inflows, pulling in $217.65 million. This sustained leadership can be attributed to several strategic advantages: Brand Trust: BlackRock’s unparalleled reputation as the world’s largest asset manager instills immense confidence in institutional and retail investors alike. Vast Distribution Network: Their extensive reach across financial advisors, brokerages, and institutional clients provides a direct pipeline for capital. Competitive Fees: While not the absolute lowest, IBIT’s fee structure is highly competitive, making it an attractive long-term holding. Proactive Engagement: BlackRock has actively engaged with the crypto community and regulators, demonstrating a serious commitment to the asset class. IBIT’s performance is a strong indicator that institutional capital is not just testing the waters but making substantial, long-term commitments to Bitcoin. This fund’s continued growth sets a benchmark for the industry and signals a robust appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Grayscale GBTC: Navigating the Outflow Landscape and Future Prospects The story of Grayscale GBTC is one of transformation and adaptation. For years, it served as the primary, albeit imperfect, vehicle for U.S. investors to gain Bitcoin exposure through a regulated product. However, its conversion to a spot ETF unleashed significant selling pressure. The $5.69 million outflow on June 23 is a continuation of this trend, as investors move out of what was once a premium-traded trust into more liquid, lower-fee ETF options. Many long-term holders are realizing gains or reallocating their capital to optimize their investment strategies. Despite the outflows, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. Its future trajectory will depend on its ability to retain its remaining investor base and potentially attract new capital if its fee structure becomes more competitive. The outflows are not necessarily a negative reflection on Bitcoin itself, but rather a reflection of market efficiency and investor preference for more optimized products. Broader Implications: What Do These Sustained Inflows Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carry profound and far-reaching implications for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They suggest: Enhanced Price Stability: The steady absorption of Bitcoin by large institutional players can reduce market volatility and provide a more stable price floor, as significant buying pressure offsets potential sell-offs. Accelerated Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs serves as a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial portfolios, encouraging broader acceptance among conservative investors and financial advisors. Increased Liquidity and Market Depth: As more capital flows into the market through ETFs, the overall liquidity of Bitcoin increases, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Regulatory Confidence: The sustained interest and capital commitment from regulated entities signal growing confidence in the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets, potentially paving the way for further innovation and product development. Potential for Supply Shock: With a finite supply of Bitcoin, continuous large-scale accumulation by ETFs could eventually lead to a supply crunch, potentially driving up the asset’s value in the long term if demand continues to outpace available supply. While the cryptocurrency market will always retain a degree of volatility, the robust demand evidenced by these ETF inflows provides a compelling bullish narrative for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and its eventual role as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs offers valuable insights: For New Investors: These ETFs provide a straightforward, regulated, and secure way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s an ideal entry point for those looking for traditional investment vehicles. For Existing Bitcoin Holders: While direct ownership remains a popular choice, ETFs can be used for diversification within a portfolio, or for tax-advantaged accounts where direct crypto ownership might be complicated. Consider Fees: Always compare the expense ratios of different ETFs. While BlackRock and Fidelity lead in inflows, other funds might offer competitive or even lower fees that could impact long-term returns. Understand Volatility: Even with institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Investors should only allocate capital they are prepared to lose and ensure it aligns with their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stay Informed: The market is dynamic. Keep an eye on ongoing inflows/outflows, regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic trends that could influence Bitcoin’s price and ETF performance. These ETFs are not just a product; they are a bridge, connecting the burgeoning world of digital assets with the established architecture of traditional finance. In conclusion, the astounding run of ten consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, capped by the impressive $350.48 million on June 23, unequivocally underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and formidable presence in mainstream investment portfolios. This relentless capital infusion, spearheaded by giants like BlackRock’s IBIT and supported by other major players, signals a profound shift from speculative interest to strategic institutional allocation. While Grayscale’s GBTC navigates its unique transition, the overall narrative is one of robust demand, increasing liquidity, and an accelerating pathway towards Bitcoin’s full integration into global finance. This trend not only validates Bitcoin’s resilience and potential but also sets a powerful precedent for its continued ascent as a legitimate and indispensable asset in the evolving economic landscape.

2025-06-24T12:00:17,"Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) has been facing significant volatility and downward pressure lately. However, analysts warn that the downtrend may not be over yet, as projections point to a deeper price crash toward $94,000 soon. According to Bitcoin’s Elliott Wave count, the cryptocurrency is currently in a vulnerable phase that may trigger more losses, despite the market’s efforts to rebound. Still, the analyst notes that the next move after this projected crash could see Bitcoin potentially reversing upward to new levels. Bitcoin Faces Epic Crash As Wave 2 Unfolds Luca, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a foreboding forecast for the Bitcoin price, warning that the flagship cryptocurrency could still be headed for more pain in the short term. The analyst has outlined an Elliott Wave count for Bitcoin that suggests that the cryptocurrency has not bottomed yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again According to the 8-hour chart breakdown, Bitcoin is in the midst of completing a Wave 2 correction within a broader bullish trend. The chart shows a five-wave corrective structure unfolding, with the final leg potentially leading to a price crash toward the $94,000 support region. This level aligns with both the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement and a key support zone. While Luca reveals that some signs indicate that the correction might have bottomed already, the analyst maintains that one final push lower remains possible before Bitcoin’s next bullish move. The projected dip toward $94,000 is framed as the concluding move of the internal Wave (v) of Wave 2, creating what could be a textbook completion of a corrective cycle. With the Bitcoin price currently sitting above the $100,000 psychological level at $105,574, a decline to $94,000 would represent a massive blow to its slowly recovering value. Despite the possibility of an upcoming bullish move, this 11.3% decline from current prices could significantly slow down BTC’s momentum, putting more strain on the already volatile market. Nevertheless, Luca suggests that this decline could present a prime accumulation opportunity, indicating that now may be a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. Game-Changing Reversal With Wave 3 Push Despite the potential for a further pullback, Luca’s broader outlook for Bitcoin remains highly bullish. The Elliott Wave count on the chart signals that BTC is preparing to exit Wave 2 and initiate Wave 3—one of the most powerful phases in the five-wave structure. Once the projected correction to the $94,000 level concludes, Luca expects a strong reversal that could catapult the cryptocurrency to new ATHs. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ A large purple upward arrow on the chart visualizes the anticipated Wave 3 surge, pointing toward a possible target zone above $122,000. This projection is rooted in the technical and historical tendency for Wave 3 to be the steepest and most aggressive wave in the Elliott Wave cycle. With Bitcoin still hovering near a high-confluence support zone, the stage appears set for a decisive rebound in the coming weeks, provided macro conditions don’t shift dramatically.

2025-06-24T11:56:56,"Bitcoin (BTC) $Price Rebounds Amid Fragile Israel-Iran Ceasefire","From some degree of panic among Bitcoin traders at $98,300, the $BTC price rebounded strongly on Monday to touch $106,000. With a somewhat patchy ceasefire now in force, there could be a calming of tensions in the Israel/Iran conflict. Will Bitcoin continue its latest rally? U.S. stock market: It’s like nothing happened Source: TradingView For the U.S. stock market it might have been that there was no escalating conflict in the Middle East. A strong trading day took the S&P 500 past the 6,000 point resistance with a near 1% move higher. As can be seen in the daily chart above, if the bulls can consolidate the price above 6,000, an all-time high will not be far away. That this recovery over the last few weeks has taken place amid huge geopolitical tensions and all the Trump tariffs repercussions says much for the inexorable march of increasing global liquidity. $BTC price shoots up to tag $106,000 resistance Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC reveals how the price shot up though resistance levels, flipping them into support, and how it just managed to touch the major resistance at $106,000 before falling back. Really, all this means is that the sideways price action has been regained, and any thoughts that the bears might have had to drag the price down much further have been stymied, at least for now. Now that the price has been rejected from $106,000, it may be that it turns back down as the short-term Stochastic RSIs seek to reset once again. This could take another few days. If the pullback is not too deep, this will give the bulls the chance to take out the $106,000 resistance on the next upward impulse. Bullish descending channel on daily time frame Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it does look like a large descending channel may have formed. This is generally a bullish candle pattern and the price has a greater expectation of exiting from the top rather than the bottom of the channel. Looking at the Stochastic RSI for the daily, it can be seen that the indicator lines are rising nicely from the bottom, indicating positive price momentum. At the very bottom of the chart is the RSI. This is showing that the indicator line has crossed above the yellow moving average line and could be about to cross up through the downtrend. Success or rejection could depend on today’s price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Brian Adesman, 32, is suing Chase Bank to recover $185,000 that was allegedly in his accounts when the bank closed them “without any notice,” reports The U.S. Sun. Adesman, a founding lawyer of the Miller Adesman law firm, says he had been a Chase Bank customer for more than a decade and had both personal and business accounts. “They refused to tell me why they were holding my money. No warning. No explanation. Just silence – while my credit score collapsed and debt collectors flooded my phone… This wasn’t just my business account. Chase shut down my personal and client trust accounts, too, without cause. It wasn’t policy enforcement. It was financial destruction.” Adesman claims the bank “destroyed” his life because after the financial institution seized his funds, he was forced to cancel his wedding and move into a caravan due to missing mortgage payments on his Los Angeles apartment. He allegedly filed complaints against the bank with government regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Attorney General and the Department of Financial Services. But more than a year later, he’s still fighting for restitution. A Chase Bank spokesman says, “We identified concerning transactions and took appropriate action as permitted by our account terms.” Chase Bank also points to a separate lawsuit filed by a company in New Jersey that claims it was duped into making fraudulent payments, including $3.7 million deposited into Adesman’s law firm’s account. Chase Bank, however, did not confirm whether the allegations led to the freezing of Adesman’s accounts. Adesman says he conducted no questionable transactions and suspects the bank flagged him solely after he received lawful settlement payments for legal services provided to a Mexican client. He also says he was unaware of the New Jersey legal case. “I was never told about, involving parties I’ve never heard of and facts I know nothing about and yet Chase is now pointing to it as some sort of retroactive justification for what they did to me.” In his initial suit, the lawyer says that Chase vowed to return some of his funds to the tune of $175,649 via a cashier’s check within 10 business days. But Adesman says he never received the promised check.

2025-06-24T11:45:53,"Security questions arise with Ledger's new offline key recovery options rollout","Ledger will roll out a new key recovery feature for new wallets, allowing offline access to the private key. The move caused a mix of security concerns, as Ledger’s devices were offered as a way to make private keys inaccessible. Ledger will introduce a key recovery feature to new wallets going forward, with a secondary PIN available for some devices. The new service, known as Recovery Key, is optional and can be used entirely offline. Recently, the company published a whitepaper about the features available with its new offline recovery. The new Ledger Recovery key is a smart card that stores a copy of the master secret, which is used to generate the Secret Recovery Phrase. The card can share the master secret from the Ledger Hardware Wallet , connecting via Near Field Communication. The Secure Element contains a tamper-resistant chip, which stores the master secret with no chance of leaking or being taken out via hardware. The element adds several layers of security, including a dedicated operating system for exclusive communication with Ledger devices, as well as a secure factory environment to avoid tampering or placing compromised devices. This is the second attempt to offer recovery to Ledger users, an answer to several high-profile cases of locked devices. However, the recovery feature also raises additional security issues for abusing the secondary PIN. Ledger Recovery debuts on Flex and Stax models Ledger Recovery is specifically tailored to the touchscreen products Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax. The new spare key is held in another secure device and can unlock the original Ledger device. A user can opt to create multiple spare keys, which are also generated online and protected. “ With Ledger Recovery Key we are making secure self-custody easy-to-use for everyone. Too many people are compromising by keeping their assets on exchanges and insecure software wallets. With Ledger Recover and now Ledger Recovery Key, as well as the traditional 24-words, we are proud to offer a recovery solution for every category of user.” ~ Ian Rogers, Chief experience officer at Ledger The new service will exist along with Ledger Recover, a paid feature that allows access to the device. However, Ledger Recover is a de-anonymizing service, requiring KYC. Some crypto owners remain skeptical of having their identity linked to crypto ownership, after multiple kidnapping cases . Ledger wallet owners have also been targeted , mostly to be pressured to unlock the device. The device itself can also be lost or abused in some cases. Ledger has already announced over 7.5 million total sales, becoming one of the leading tools for crypto hardware storage. Ledger introduces transaction check As Web3 usage increases, Ledger also boosted its software to intercept potentially harmful transactions. Ledger Transaction Check is the newest feature in Ledger Live, aiming at vetting transactions. The extra security is mostly targeted at Ethereum users. Transaction Check just hit Ledger Live: meet real-time threat detection for your Ethereum. Every time you want to sign a transaction, it scans to flag potential threats.

Tracked… pic.twitter.com/wur5EF7rPF — Ledger (@Ledger) June 23, 2025 While Ledger offers heightened security, signing with the devices may still be compromised. Bybit was reportedly using a Ledger Nano , but the exchange was still compromised via a multisig wallet that led to the loss of $1.4 billion. The feature adds more clarity to signing in an environment where malicious smart contracts can hijack the permission of Ethereum wallets, despite the secure hardware protection.

2025-06-24T11:42:07,"Ministry of Treasury and Finance Pressed the Button on Cryptocurrencies! Mehmet Şimşek Announced What Will Happen!","While many steps have been taken to regulate the cryptocurrency sector in Türkiye, a final move has come. At this point, Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that new steps were taken to prevent the laundering of criminal proceeds obtained from illegal betting and fraud through cryptocurrency asset transactions. According to AA, the Ministry of Treasury and Finance will introduce a regulatory package that will increase transparency and control in transactions made through Crypto Asset Service Providers (CSAs). In this context, the traceability of criminal proceeds is increased through time limits, transfer limits and strict identity checks. The report stated that crypto asset platforms must disclose information regarding the source and purpose of the money and other funds that are the subject of the transactions they mediate. In this context, it was stated that in all cryptocurrency transfer transactions, it will be mandatory to obtain a transaction description of at least 20 characters from the customer performing the transaction. With the new regulations, the cryptocurrencies in question will be prevented from being quickly removed from the system. At this point, it is planned to impose a time limit for crypto withdrawal transactions that do not apply to the travel rule. In this context, crypto withdrawals can only be made 48 hours after purchase, exchange or deposit transactions. This period will be at least 72 hours for the first withdrawal transactions to be made from the account. It was also stated that a daily limit would be imposed on stablecoin transfers, and that this would be a limitation of 3 thousand dollars and 50 thousand dollars per month. Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that these restrictions will ensure that additional oversight and control is applied to exchanges to prevent money laundering through cryptocurrencies. Şimşek added that no restrictions were imposed on the legitimate area. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ministry of Treasury and Finance Pressed the Button on Cryptocurrencies!

2025-06-24T11:41:02,"Massive Altcoin Breakout: 20%+ Daily Gains—Is This the Beginning of an AltSeason?","The post Massive Altcoin Breakout: 20%+ Daily Gains—Is This the Beginning of an AltSeason? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the first few days of May 2025, when the Bitcoin price broke above the consolidated zone around $96,000, the altcoins also triggered a massive upswing. Altseason is when 75% of the top 100 cryptos outperform Bitcoin for a period of time. This is complemented by rising Altcoin dominance and a drop in BTC dominance. The current Altcoin season Index chart suggests the Altseason could not be near, as the index remains stuck below 20, hinting towards the dominance of Bitcoin. As seen in the above chart, the altcoin market cap seems to be gaining ground, but the Altcoin season index continues to plunge. This suggests Bitcoin holds a significant dominance, and hence the liquidity inflow is largely into the star token rather than the other altcoins. However, over the past 90 days, only a few altcoins like SYRUP, HYPE and VIRTUAL have recorded three-digit gains, and many popular altcoins remain under bearish influence. Bitcoin & Stablecoin Dominance Reach Crucial Juncture It is a known fact that after Bitcoin & Ethereum, stablecoins like USDT or USDC are the largest traded tokens. Therefore, their dominance in the markets sheds light on the mindset of the investors regarding whether they are going with Bitcoin or altcoin. In an interesting update, the collective dominance of Bitcoin, USDT, USDC & DAI displays a similar pattern to the one it displayed during the previous Altseasons. A popular analyst, Moustache , refers to the combined dominance of the tokens and has discovered a very interesting pattern. The levels have triggered a bearish divergence after reaching a particular resistance. This has occurred before the start of the previous Altseasons. Now that the levels have again triggered a bearish divergence after testing the resistance, the analyst believes the Altseason 2025 is loading. Which Altcoins to Follow Ahead of the Altseason? Ever since Bitcoin has been making massive moves, the tokens within the top 10 do not seem to have followed the trend. However, the other altcoins, specifically the memecoins, AI, RWA, and DeFi tokens, have been making huge noise. Over the past few days, the SEI price has been rising with over 40% gains, while the current intraday trade suggests JasmyCoin, SPX6900, dogwifhat, Virtuals Protocol, Jupiter & Sonic have been attracting gains over 20%. Apart from these, many other tokens continue to possess double-digit gains, hinting towards the rising dominance of the altcoins. On the other hand, the BTC dominance faces rejection from the highs at 65.95% and could be heading towards the local support at around 64.69%. These could be crucial levels to access the next course of action, as a rebound could delay the AltSeason, while a bearish continuation could revive the hopes.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-altcoin-breakout-20-daily-gains-is-this-the-beginning-of-an-altseason/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:36:22,"WazirX News: Singapore Court Approves New Hearing on User Repayment","The post WazirX News: Singapore Court Approves New Hearing on User Repayment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Singapore High Court has granted Indian cryptocurrency platform WazirX the opportunity to present further arguments in its ongoing restructuring case. After months of anticipation and silence, WazirX confirmed the extension of its court-granted moratorium via a post on X (formerly Twitter). Singapore Court Allows WazirX to Present Its Case Previously, the court had declined to approve WazirX’s restructuring plan, prompting the company to file for relocation to Panama and rebrand itself as Zensui Corporation . However, the tide may be turning. In a statement, WazirX announced: “The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court’s sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium… from 6 June 2025 until the disposal of the aforesaid further arguments.” This extension could give WazirX a final chance to solidify its restructuring plan and potentially begin resolving user repayments. Will WazirX Users Finally Get Their Funds Back? Since the $234 million hack in July 2024 , thousands of users have waited in vain for clear communication or compensation. WazirX had earlier promised to return 85% of user balances, but that pledge has been mired in legal delays and unclear updates. Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court's sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium granted in HC/OA 1284/2024… pic.twitter.com/QdozZHnWVX — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 24, 2025 Despite mounting pressure on social media, the company has largely remained silent, offering only generic reassurances like “we are doing our best.” In their latest tweet, WazirX stated: “We are currently awaiting directions from the Court on the next steps and will keep you informed as soon as we have more clarity.” This statement, while more official, still lacks concrete timelines—leaving users frustrated and in limbo. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Users May Won’t Get Full Lost Funds Back – Here’s Why! , One Year Later: Still Waiting As July 2025 approaches, it marks one year since the WazirX security breach—one of the largest crypto hacks of 2024. The extended silence and lack of action have left users questioning the company’s commitment to recovery. The latest ruling by the Singapore High Court offers a ray of hope—but only if WazirX takes swift and transparent steps forward. Final Thoughts WazirX’s restructuring and moratorium extension could be a turning point—but whether it leads to actual repayment for users or more delays remains to be seen. With mounting pressure and legal timelines closing in, WazirX must act fast to regain trust and credibility in the crypto community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Singapore High Court has granted WazirX permission to present further arguments regarding its restructuring plan and has extended the moratorium on legal action. This allows WazirX more time to propose how they will handle debts, including user repayments. Will WazirX users get their funds back? WazirX previously promised to return up to 85% of user balances based on holdings at the time of the hack. However, actual repayments have not yet started , and users are awaiting a final court-approved resolution. When can WazirX users expect the repayment to begin? As of now, there is no fixed timeline . WazirX recently tweeted that they are “awaiting directions from the Court,” which means users must wait for the next hearing outcome to know repayment schedules. Can I still access or withdraw my funds from WazirX? Currently, most withdrawals remain restricted for affected users. Only a few assets may be accessible depending on user accounts, and this could change after court rulings.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/wazirx-news-singapore-court-approves-new-hearing-on-user-repayment/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Exchange News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:36:01,"Japan Reveals New Crypto Rules That Could Legalize Bitcoin ETFs","The post Japan Reveals New Crypto Rules That Could Legalize Bitcoin ETFs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Japan is getting serious about crypto and the changes coming could shake up everything from taxes to Bitcoin ETFs. On June 24, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) released a document that could mark a turning point for the country’s approach to digital assets. Titled “Considerations regarding the structure of the system surrounding crypto assets,” the report confirms a new working group has been set up to explore major regulatory reforms. These proposals will be discussed further at a Financial Services Council meeting on June 25. Here’s why you should care. Crypto Could Soon Be Treated Like Stocks Right now, crypto in Japan is regulated under the Payment Services Act – a framework that doesn’t really match how people are using these assets today. The FSA is now considering moving crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which would officially treat digital assets as financial products. That one change could open up a lot of doors. A Big Tax Break Is on the Table One of the biggest outcomes of this shift? Lower taxes. Under current rules, crypto investors face up to 55% in comprehensive taxation. But under FIEA, the system would switch to a flat self-assessment tax of around 20%, just like stocks. It’s a move that could make Japan far more appealing to both everyday investors and institutions, especially those holding back due to the heavy tax burden. Bitcoin ETFs Might Finally Get the Green Light Another major change in sight: Japan could lift its ban on Bitcoin ETFs. If crypto is treated as a financial product, it paves the way for regulated crypto investment vehicles – something Japan has held back on for years. With ETFs gaining traction globally, this would bring the country in line with bigger markets and potentially attract new capital. Not Just Hype! Web3 Is Policy Now These changes aren’t coming out of nowhere. They’re part of Japan’s wider push to grow its economy through innovation and digital assets. The government’s Grand Design and Action Plan for New Capitalism (2025) makes it clear: crypto, NFTs, and other Web3 tools are now part of the plan to boost productivity and unlock value across Japan’s regions. The goal is to support businesses, create investment opportunities, and tap into digital assets in ways that help Japan compete globally. Following the Global Shift Interestingly, Japan’s sudden crypto momentum might be linked to growing support for crypto in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration and in pro-crypto states like Texas. For Japan, a country known for its cautious stance, this looks like a clear pivot from regulation to integration. And if these proposals go through, it could be the moment Japan officially steps back into the global crypto race.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/japan-reveals-new-crypto-rules-that-could-legalize-bitcoin-etfs/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

According to a Bloomberg report, the firm plans to allocate up to $10 million to crypto investment strategies operated by Re7 Capital, although the exact amount is still under consideration. The move signals VMS Group’s efforts to diversify its portfolio toward more liquid asset classes, as stated by managing partner Elton Cheung. “The decision is part of recent moves by VMS to diversify into more liquid investments,” Cheung said. Shifting from Illiquid Investments Cheung noted that while VMS has enjoyed success in private equity and other long-term holdings, these investments have become increasingly difficult to exit due to a growing trend of companies delaying public listings. This shift in market dynamics has influenced VMS Group’s strategy toward more agile asset classes such as crypto. Indirect Exposure Through Re7 Capital Rather than investing directly in digital tokens, VMS is opting for an indirect approach by allocating funds to Re7 Capital. The firm specializes in digital asset strategies, focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) and other yield-generating crypto opportunities. This strategy allows VMS to gain exposure to the digital asset ecosystem while maintaining a degree of risk control. Favorable Regulatory Environment Cheung emphasized that the firm’s move is also supported by improving global regulations and rising institutional interest in the sector. “We thought this was the right time because of growing demand and because we see clearer legislative and government support from various jurisdictions, as well as large institutional support and endorsement,” he said. Hong Kong’s Regulatory Push for Crypto Hong Kong has taken active steps in recent months to encourage innovation in the digital asset space. In early June, regulators approved a framework allowing professional investors to trade crypto derivatives. Around the same time, the government reportedly began using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol in its central bank digital currency (CBDC) research. Additionally, legislation passed in May allows the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins by the end of the year. Growing Corporate Interest in Crypto Several Hong Kong-based firms are already adding digital assets to their treasuries. Last week, MemeStrategy—an investment firm managed by 9GAG—became the first publicly listed company in the region to purchase Solana (SOL), acquiring over 2,400 tokens for approximately $368,000. Earlier in May, DDC Enterprise, a ready-meal seller, purchased 21 Bitcoin as part of a larger plan to accumulate 5,000 BTC over the next three years. These developments reflect a broader shift among businesses in Hong Kong towards embracing crypto assets. Awaiting Comment VMS Group has yet to respond to media inquiries regarding the investment and was unreachable for comment at the time of publication.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/hong-kong-wealth-manager-makes-strategic-entry-into-crypto-through-re7-capital/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

All Eyes on Capitol Hill as Crypto Markets Bleed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress and the Senate, and markets are holding their breath. With Bitcoin plunging to $98.5K and altcoins struggling, crypto investors are looking for clues on interest rate cuts, inflation risks, and what’s next for the economy. This comes at a critical moment, with Powell under intense political pressure and global tensions flaring. The financial world wants answers and fast. Under Pressure: Trump, Warren, and Fed Officials Push for Cuts Powell is facing heat from both sides of the aisle after the Fed chose to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.5% in June. President Donald Trump slammed the Fed’s cautious stance, calling it a mistake and demanding deep rate cuts of 2–3%. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller are also calling for earlier cuts, possibly as soon as July. According to CME FedWatch data , the odds of a July cut stand at 23%, while chances for a September cut are much higher at 82%. Powell’s testimony is expected to address why the Fed is still holding back despite growing demands. Crypto Takes a Hit as Tariff Talk Spooks Investors The crypto market is in rough shape. Bitcoin has dropped to a multi-month low, and altcoins are deep in the red. Much of this stems from fears around Trump’s proposed trade tariffs, which have added more uncertainty to an already fragile economy. Powell is expected to talk about how these tariffs might impact the Fed’s decisions. If he leans toward easing rates, crypto prices could bounce. But if he sticks to a cautious tone, the U.S. dollar could strengthen and that usually means more pain for digital assets. Tensions in the Middle East Stir Inflation Fears Recent U.S. airstrikes in Iran have pushed oil and gold prices higher, raising fresh concerns about inflation. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran is also raising the risk of a potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping route. If that happens, fuel prices could skyrocket, making it harder for the Fed to meet its inflation goals. Powell’s comments on these risks will be watched closely, as they could shape expectations for interest rate policy through the rest of 2025. Powell’s Testimony Could Shift the Market Powell’s upcoming remarks could be a turning point. Investors want to know – will he signal relief with rate cuts, or continue to play it safe? Whatever he says, the outcome is likely to shape the market’s direction for months to come, especially in crypto.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-powell-cut-rates-all-eyes-on-capitol-hill-as-crypto-markets-bleed/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

But prices pulled back slightly after Iran broke the ceasefire deal. Still, the market remains in the green, with XRP and Cardano holding onto impressive 7–9% gains. Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that Bitcoin has officially flipped the trend. After a major crash below $100K, BTC is now back on an uptrend, breaking past $103K and hitting resistance. #Bitcoin has a trendswitch. It's uptrending now, after we've had a massive liquidation crash taking place to sub $100K. It broke through $103K and hit the next resistance.

If the conflict de-escalates again, Bitcoin could be setting up for another strong rally. Yesterday's Iranian attack on U.S. bases was a near copy of their 2020 response. Back then, after the U.S. killed General Soleimani, Iran launched missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq. A symbolic strike with advance warning to Iraq to prevent casualties. Now look what happened to… pic.twitter.com/hrNJqG1F70 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 24, 2025 Bitcoin Shows Strength Analysts are doubling down on their $120,000 target for Bitcoin this year, and recent developments make that case even stronger. Bitcoin has shown resilience above $100K despite geopolitical tensions. Falling oil prices and Fed rate cut expectations in July are also boosting investor confidence. XRP: Breakout Ahead with ETF Hopes and DeFi Expansion XRP is at a major turning point. Institutional interest is picking up, and XRP ETF odds are higher than ever. Meanwhile, the long-standing Ripple vs. SEC case is finally coming to a resolution. These two catalysts alone could fuel a major rally. To top it all, Ripple is teaming up with Cardano to bring XRP into DeFi. Through cross-chain bridges and Lace wallet support, XRP holders could soon earn rewards, including NIGHT tokens from Cardano’s upcoming airdrop. With all this lining up, XRP could be on the verge of its biggest breakout in years. In previous cycles, XRP hovered around $0.50 before exploding 6x to $3 in just six weeks. We could see a similar move ahead. Cardano’s Midnight Could Be the Breakout Catalyst Cardano could finally have the catalyst it needs to break out: Midnight . This new protocol is built directly on Cardano and fully relies on it for security, governance, and token movement. The upcoming NIGHT token airdrop is huge, with 50% of the supply going to ADA holders. If Midnight succeeds, analysts believe that the token could quickly become a top 25 project, and that momentum would directly boost Cardano’s value. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that the Lace wallet, which already supports ADA and BTC, will soon support XRP too. He is also working on a cross-chain bridge between XRP and Midnight’s sidechain. Also, the odds for a Cardano ETF approval in 2025 have jumped to 71%. All these signs show that Cardano is gaining momentum, and a breakout could be next. Looking ahead to Q4, the Fed rate cuts and more liquidity could spark the next big crypto rally. If global tensions cool and central banks ease up, Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano could be ready to rise again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/whats-next-for-xrp-ada-and-btc-prices/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|XRP|AIRDROP","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T11:20:17,"Dogecoin Leads Market Recovery with 8.15% Pump: What are the Best Meme Coins to Buy Right Now?","Just like that, the war between Israel and Iran is over, at least according to US President Donald Trump. The crypto market, including meme coins, has reacted positively to the statement after being on edge when the US joined the fray and bombed three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Trump posted on Truth Social that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, effectively ending what he called ‘The 12-Day War’. While Iran reportedly confirmed this , an official from the country said that it won’t stop the hostilities unless Israel ceases attacking the Islamic country. Despite that, the market has already reacted positively to Trump’s statement. $DOGE Leads Meme Coin Rally The meme coin market saw a significant jump over the past 24 hours as the US president’s post made its rounds on social media and news outlets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the meme coin market had a 10% spike in its market cap and 16% in its trading volume over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin ($DOGE) led the rally as it rose by 8.15% during the same period. The meme coin’s price is currently at $0.1663 and is inching closer to the $0.17 level it held before the American bombing of Iran over the weekend. 3 Meme Coins to Watch for as the Market Recovers The recovery of the crypto market has put everyone in buy mode. With so many options out there, here are three of the top meme coins you shouldn’t miss: 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find the Latest Meme Coins with the Telegram-Native Crypto Trading Bot With the flurry of activity in the meme coin market today, it can be a challenge to find the hottest one to invest in. The information is spread across different platforms, and unscrupulous entities could try to lure you in with fake coins and other scams. That’s where Snorter Bot comes in. This project, powered by its native Snorter Token ($SNORT) , simplifies how you trade with its Telegram-native trading bot by letting you snipe new crypto , manage your portfolio, detect scams, and more. To support the project, you can get $SNORT tokens via its official presale page. Each token only costs $0.0961, but a price increase will happen a day from now, so it’s always better to act as soon as you can. Our Snorter Token buying guide has all the information you need to do this, from connecting your crypto wallet to staking your tokens. If you decide to stake your $SNORT tokens, you can enjoy passive rewards. It’s currently set at 266% p.a., but expect this to change as more investors lock in their tokens in the staking pool. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Go All In on Bitcoin, Earn Free $BTC Airdrops Even in the world of meme coins, Bitcoin ($BTC) still reigns supreme. That’s why the team behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is rallying true $BTC believers to help push the crypto to $250K and beyond. Its main selling point is its free $BTC airdrops when the crypto’s price reaches $150K and $200K. Then, a free $BTCBULL airdrop will happen when $BTC hits the $250K mark. Buying $BTCBULL tokens gives you the chance to participate in these events. Aside from that, the team will have regular token burns at the $125K, $175K, and $225K $BTC price milestones. These will reduce the supply of $BTCBULL, which should further drive their prices. Getting on the team’s native token is easy. First, visit the official BTC Bull Token presale page , connect your crypto wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ) to the presale widget, input how many tokens you’ll buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. You’ll then receive your tokens when the presale concludes. You can get $BTCBULL for only $0.00258 at the moment, which is a small price to pay to get the chance to join in the free airdrop events. Staking is an option, too, if you want to receive passive rewards while supporting the project. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , HODLing is another alternative, especially if you’re banking on it being worth as much as $0.06467. 3. Pepe ($PEPE) – The OG Meme Coin with No Signs of Slowing Down Pepe ($PEPE) may have spawned countless copycats, but it remains one of the top meme coins, along with $DOGE and Shiba Inu ($SHIB). Proof of this is its trading activity over the past 24 hours, which saw a 10% increase in its market cap and a 32% jump in its trading volume. But behind its degen façade, is some method to the madness. For one, there’s its burning mechanism that permanently removes $PEPE coins from circulation and pushes up the price of the remaining coins. Then there’s its generous staking rewards. This encourages HODLers to continue supporting the project. $PEPE tokens are widely available in major exchanges, including MEXC , Binance , and KuCoin . Time to Buy as Meme Coins Make a Comeback Investors have been buying after Trump’s ceasefire post, with $DOGE leading the rally. If you’re looking to pump your funds into up-and-coming meme coins, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are also attractive options. But before you buy, do your research first.

2025-06-24T11:20:13,"Bitcoin Shorting: Abraxas Capital Faces Staggering $14.5M Loss","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Shorting: Abraxas Capital Faces Staggering $14.5M Loss In the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, high-stakes bets are a daily occurrence. However, even seasoned players can find themselves on the wrong side of a market move. Recently, news broke that Abraxas Capital, a prominent London-based investment manager, incurred a significant unrealized loss of $14.5 million on its Bitcoin shorting position within a mere 24 hours. This development, reported by Arkham on X, serves as a stark reminder of the immense volatility and inherent risks involved in institutional crypto trading , particularly when dealing with substantial crypto shorts . What Exactly Happened? Abraxas Capital’s Bold Bet The report from Arkham, a well-known on-chain analytics platform, highlighted the rapid turn of events for Abraxas Capital. While the exact timing of their short position entry isn’t publicly detailed, the $14.5 million figure represents an unrealized loss, meaning the position is still open and the loss hasn’t been crystallized by closing the trade. This substantial figure, accrued over just one day, underscores the swift and often brutal movements characteristic of the Bitcoin market. Despite this recent setback, Abraxas Capital continues to hold a formidable presence in the crypto derivatives market. Their portfolio still includes over $450 million in total crypto shorts, with more than $200 million specifically allocated to Bitcoin. This indicates a continued, albeit challenged, bearish outlook on certain crypto assets or perhaps a complex hedging strategy designed to offset other long positions within their broader investment framework. For an investment manager of Abraxas Capital’s caliber, managing such large positions requires sophisticated risk assessment and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Understanding Bitcoin Shorting: A Risky Endeavor For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin shorting , or short selling, is a trading strategy where an investor profits from a decline in an asset’s price. It’s the inverse of traditional investing, where you buy low and sell high. Here’s how it generally works: Borrowing: The short seller borrows Bitcoin from a broker or exchange. Selling: They immediately sell the borrowed Bitcoin on the open market at the current price. Waiting: The short seller then waits for the price of Bitcoin to drop. Buying Back: If the price falls, they buy back the same amount of Bitcoin at the lower price. Returning: The bought-back Bitcoin is returned to the lender, and the short seller pockets the difference, minus any fees or interest on the borrowed assets. While seemingly straightforward, short selling carries significant risks, especially with highly volatile assets like Bitcoin. Unlike a traditional ‘long’ position where your maximum loss is your initial investment (if the asset goes to zero), a short position has theoretically unlimited loss potential. If the price of the asset rises instead of falls, the short seller has to buy it back at a higher price to return it, and there’s no ceiling to how high an asset’s price can go. This is precisely what likely contributed to Abraxas Capital’s recent unrealized loss . Short Selling vs. Long Investing: Key Differences To further clarify the contrast, consider the fundamental differences: Feature Short Selling Long Investing Market Outlook Bearish (expect price to fall) Bullish (expect price to rise) Profit Source Price decline Price increase Risk Profile Potentially unlimited loss Limited loss (initial investment) Mechanism Borrow, Sell, Buy Back, Return Buy, Hold, Sell Time Horizon Often shorter-term Can be short or long-term The Peril of Institutional Crypto Trading: High Stakes, Higher Volatility The case of Abraxas Capital underscores the unique challenges faced by firms engaged in institutional crypto trading . While institutions bring significant capital and sophisticated strategies to the market, they are not immune to its inherent volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are known for their dramatic price swings, often influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and even social media sentiment. For an investment manager like Abraxas Capital, navigating these waters means constantly re-evaluating positions, managing significant exposure, and having robust risk management protocols in place. A $14.5 million loss, even if unrealized, is a substantial sum that requires careful consideration. It highlights the fine line between calculated risk and significant financial setback that even large, experienced players must walk. Moreover, the transparency offered by on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham means that institutional movements, both profitable and loss-making, are increasingly visible. This level of public scrutiny adds another layer of pressure for firms managing substantial crypto shorts and other positions. Navigating Significant Crypto Shorts: Strategies and Risks When an entity holds significant crypto shorts , especially in a market as volatile as Bitcoin’s, risk management becomes paramount. While the exact strategies employed by Abraxas Capital are proprietary, institutional traders typically employ several techniques to mitigate potential losses: Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically closing a position if the price moves against them by a certain percentage, limiting potential losses. Position Sizing: Carefully determining the amount of capital allocated to a single trade to ensure no single loss can critically damage the overall portfolio. Hedging: Holding offsetting positions (e.g., being long in one asset while shorting another correlated asset) to balance risk. Diversification: Spreading investments across various assets to avoid over-reliance on any single one. Constant Monitoring: Utilizing advanced analytics and real-time data to track market movements and adjust positions rapidly. One of the biggest threats to short sellers, particularly in crypto, is a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when a cryptocurrency’s price rises sharply, forcing short sellers to buy back their borrowed assets to cover their positions and limit further losses. This forced buying, in turn, pushes the price even higher, creating a vicious cycle that can lead to massive losses for those holding short positions. Bitcoin has a history of dramatic short squeezes, fueled by its passionate community and rapid liquidity shifts. The fact that Abraxas Capital still holds over $200 million in Bitcoin shorts after this unrealized loss suggests either a strong conviction in their bearish outlook for the medium to long term, or that these shorts are part of a more complex, multi-layered hedging strategy designed to protect a larger portfolio from potential downturns. What Does This Unrealized Loss Mean for the Market? The news of Abraxas Capital’s significant unrealized loss on its Bitcoin short position carries several implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: Reminder of Volatility: It serves as a powerful reminder that even with institutional-level resources and expertise, the crypto market remains incredibly volatile and unpredictable. Institutional Caution: While institutions are increasingly entering the crypto space, such events might lead some to approach highly leveraged or directional bets with greater caution. Transparency in On-Chain Data: The fact that Arkham could identify and report this loss highlights the growing transparency of on-chain data, allowing for a clearer view of institutional flows and positions. This is a double-edged sword: it offers insights but also exposes large players to public scrutiny. Lessons for All Traders: Both institutional and retail traders can learn from this. The importance of strict risk management, understanding the full scope of potential losses, and not over-leveraging positions cannot be overstated. Even the pros get it wrong sometimes. This event doesn’t necessarily signal a widespread bearish sentiment among institutions, as many continue to explore and invest in crypto through various avenues, including spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, it does highlight the inherent risks of aggressive directional bets in a market prone to rapid reversals. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Picture for Bitcoin Bitcoin has seen remarkable price action recently, fueled by factors such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., increasing institutional adoption, and the upcoming halving event. In this context, taking a significant Bitcoin shorting position might seem counterintuitive to some. However, institutions might short Bitcoin for several reasons: Hedging: If Abraxas Capital holds substantial long positions in other crypto assets or even in Bitcoin itself, shorting could be a way to hedge against a potential market downturn, protecting their overall portfolio value. Contrarian View: Some firms might genuinely believe that Bitcoin is overvalued at certain points and due for a correction, positioning themselves to profit from such a decline. Arbitrage Opportunities: In complex trading strategies, short positions might be part of an arbitrage play across different exchanges or derivatives markets. Regardless of their specific motivation, this incident reaffirms that the crypto market is a battleground where even the most sophisticated strategies can face unexpected headwinds. The ongoing evolution of institutional crypto trading will undoubtedly continue to generate both incredible profits and significant losses, shaping the future landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Market Realities The $14.5 million unrealized loss incurred by Abraxas Capital on its Bitcoin shorting position serves as a powerful, real-world example of the inherent volatility and risk associated with cryptocurrency markets, even for experienced players engaged in large-scale institutional crypto trading . It underscores that while the potential rewards in crypto are high, so too are the risks, particularly when employing strategies like holding substantial crypto shorts . This event should prompt both institutional and retail investors to double down on robust risk management practices, conduct thorough due diligence, and always be prepared for unexpected market movements. In a landscape where transparency is increasing thanks to platforms like Arkham, the actions and outcomes of major players become lessons for all. The saga of Abraxas Capital’s Bitcoin short is a vivid illustration that in the world of digital assets, fortune favors the prepared, but even the prepared can face staggering challenges.

2025-06-24T11:19:26,"Kaspersky reports compromised mobile malware stealing users' crypto seed phrases","Kaspersky security researchers have uncovered a mobile malware campaign targeting cryptocurrency users through infected applications. SparkKitty spyware reportedly steals device screenshots containing seed phrases using optical character recognition technology across iOS and Android platforms through official app stores. SparkKitty malware infiltrates official app stores targeting crypto Kaspersky researchers discovered the SparkKitty spyware campaign in January 2025, following their previous identification of SparkCat malware targeting cryptocurrency wallets. The new threat distributes malicious applications through unofficial sources as well as official Google Play and App Store platforms, with infected apps already removed from Google Play following researcher notifications. SparkKitty attacks iOS and Android platforms with multiple delivery mechanisms for each. On iOS, malware payloads are delivered through frameworks that masquerade as legitimate libraries like AFNetworking.framework or Alamofire.framework, or obfuscated libraries masquerading as libswiftDarwin.dylib. The malware also inserts itself directly into applications. Android operating systems employ both Java and Kotlin languages, with Kotlin versions employed as malicious Xposed modules. The majority of malware versions indiscriminately hijack all the images on devices, although researchers detected similar malicious clusters employing optical character recognition to attack specific pictures with sensitive information. The campaign has been active since at least February 2024, and it has also shared targeting tactics and infrastructure with the previous SparkCat operation. SparkKitty has a wider reach than SparkCat’s targeted attack on cryptocurrency seed phrases because it scrapes all images that are available from infected devices. This has the potential to harvest other kinds of sensitive financial and personal information stored in device galleries. TikTok mods from obscure stores serve as primary infection vector Kaspersky analysts initially came across the campaign when tracking regularly suspicious links that were propagating modifications of TikTok Android apps. The modified apps executed additional malware code when users launched main app activities. The config file URLs were presented as buttons within the compromised apps, launching WebView sessions to display TikToki Mall, an internet shopping portal that takes cryptocurrency for consumer items. Registration and purchasing were restricted to require invitation codes, so researchers were unable to determine the store’s legitimacy or if it was operational. iOS infection vectors exploit Apple Developer Program enterprise profiles to circumvent normal app install restrictions. Screenshot of an infected app on the App Store Attackers hijack enterprise certificates for enterprise-level organizational app distribution, enabling malicious apps to install on any device without App Store approval. Enterprise profile misuse is one widespread tactic employed by developers of inappropriate apps such as online casinos, software cracks, and illegal modifications. Infected versions of TikTok iOS applications request photo gallery permissions during startup, which is absent in genuine releases of TikTok. The malware is integrated into frameworks that pretend to be AFNetworking.framework and tampered AFImageDownloader classes and other AFImageDownloaderTool components. Android malware variants steal images through cryptocurrency-themed applications Android versions of SparkKitty operate through cryptocurrency-themed applications with malicious code embedded in entry points. The malware requests configuration files containing command and control server addresses, decrypting them using AES-256 encryption in ECB mode before establishing communication with remote servers. Image theft occurs through two-stage processes involving device fingerprinting and selective upload mechanisms. The malware creates MD5 hashes combining device IMEI, MAC addresses, and random UUIDs, storing these identifiers in files on external storage. Profile installation flow. Source: Kaspersky Casino applications utilize LSPosed framework integration, functioning as malicious Xposed modules that hook application entry points. One infected messaging application with cryptocurrency exchange features reached over 10,000 installations on Google Play before removal following Kaspersky notifications.

2025-06-24T11:15:57,"Israeli Arrested for Selling Secrets to Iran for Crypto","The post Israeli Arrested for Selling Secrets to Iran for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As global tensions increase and digital assets gain ground, a new front in warfare technique is emerging, one that’s funded by crypto. In an eye-opening instance, Israeli authorities have arrested a 27-year-old man from Tel Aviv, accusing him of spying for Iran in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. Though Trump announced an Iran-Israel ceasefire, this spy case has added a new twist in the global arena. Spying for Crypto Raises Red Flags As per the local media report , authorities claim that the man had been in contact with an Iranian agent for several months. During this time, he reportedly carried out several intelligence-related tasks at the agent’s request. These included photographing the homes of Israeli public officials, documenting military bases, and even spray-painting graffiti, possibly as a form of coded messaging or psychological warfare. According to investigators, the suspect received thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency as payment for his work. This digital trail has raised red flags, showing how cryptocurrencies can be used to fund covert and potentially dangerous activities. During a search of the man’s home, officials confiscated computers and digital storage devices believed to have been used to communicate with his Iranian handlers. While the full extent of his activities is still being investigated, the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court has extended his detention until June 26 to allow authorities more time to gather evidence. Iranian Recruitment Campaigns Targeting Israelis The Shin Bet and Israeli police issued a joint warning following the arrest, urging the public to remain cautious of foreign contact, particularly on social media. They revealed that Iranian intelligence and affiliated terror groups are actively trying to recruit Israelis through online platforms. Security officials emphasized that any citizen caught cooperating with enemy states would face severe legal consequences. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Iran Breaks Ceasefire With Israel, $500M Wiped From Crypto Market , Warning Call for the Public? This case surfaces amid growing crypto-related concerns on both sides. Just last week, Iran’s central bank imposed stricter controls on domestic crypto exchanges after a cyberattack drained $90 million from Nobitex, the country’s largest platform. As Iran tightens its oversight, the use of crypto in covert operations and illicit financing continues to blur the lines between financial freedom and national security threats. In a digital world where enemies may be only a message away, the role of crypto in global conflict is becoming harder to ignore. However, this is not the first time crypto has been used for illegal activities. There are many scams, terrorist fundings in the past have shaken the ground for crypto investors, and this new warfare psychology is something that needs to be taken seriously with grounded crypto rules. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Reclaims $105K as Iran Tensions Ease, Bulls Regroup","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) ""Always fade geopolitics,"" the founders of the LondonCryptoClub newsletter said Monday as bitcoin BTC fell below $100,000 after Iran fired missiles at U.S. airbases in the Middle East. It looks like they were right. BTC quickly reversed its drop and has since topped $105,000, restoring spirits in the broader market, where VIRTUAL, JUP and SEI are flashing gains of over 20%, according to CoinDesk data. The path of least resistance appears to be to the higher side, with President Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although unconfirmed reports of fresh aggression by Tehran and a response from Jerusalem introduce a note of caution. Also supporting a gain: At least two Fed members appointed by Trump are now leaning in favor of a rate cut next month and the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency is studying the use of crypto holdings in the mortgage qualification process. Anthony Pompliano's ProCap Financial plans to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, with a focus on bitcoin asset management and revenue generation. ""While the ceasefire optimism is driving short-term gains, the risk of renewed tensions remains elevated,"" Valentin Fournier, the lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""That said, ETF inflows and ProCap’s IPO signal growing institutional demand, even near cycle highs — a strong vote of confidence for long-term upside."" The U.S. Federal Reserve removed the concept of “reputational risk” from its formal bank supervision program, supposedly easing crypto banking restrictions. Bloomberg reported that VMS Group, a multifamily office with just under $4 billion in assets under management, is considering a $10 million allocation to strategies managed by decentralized finance hedge fund Re7 Capital. In traditional markets, the dollar index fell to 98, extending Monday's sell-off, while the price of gold dropped to its 50-day simple moving average at $3,318. Nasdaq futures chalked out a golden crossover, offering bullish cues to the crypto market. Stay alert! What to Watch Crypto June 25: ZIGChain (ZIG) mainnet will go live .

Faster blocks mean faster confirmations, with more frequent data updates for wallets, DeFi apps, and L2s — creating a smoother, more responsive blockchain. DeFi efficiency could improve as a result of tighter arbitrage windows, faster price discovery and lower trading fees due to higher liquidity in AMMs. Key timing changes include reducing block proposal time to 3 seconds, attestations to 1.5 seconds and aggregation to 1.5 seconds. Monnot argues Ethereum’s “service price” will rise, making it more competitive as a global settlement and confirmation layer. Potential drawbacks include bandwidth pressure, validator performance issues, and network instability if poorly implemented. The proposal targets the 2026 Glamsterdam upgrade, which focuses on gas optimizations and protocol-level speedups across the Ethereum blockchain.
