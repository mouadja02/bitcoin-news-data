2025-06-24T17:44:44,"Bitcoin Miner CleanSpark Hits 50 EH/s Hashrate Milestone","CleanSpark (CLSK), a U.S.-based bitcoin BTC mining firm, said Tuesday that it reached 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) of operational hashrate — a milestone that makes it one of the largest mining operations in the world. The company built and operates more than 30 sites across Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wyoming. A vertically integrated setup gives CleanSpark control over energy procurement and operations, helping reduce costs and boost uptime. “It reflects years of focused strategy, disciplined execution, and a relentless commitment to doing things the right way,” said CEO Zach Bradford. Hashrate is a metric used to measure the computing power behind the Bitcoin network. The higher a given company’s hashrate, the higher its chances of earning bitcoin rewards. The firm is now preparing to scale up to 60 EH/s, with Bradford stating the company was in “escape velocity” mode. Meanwhile, CleanSpark’s Digital Asset Management arm has begun actively managing over 12,500 self-mined bitcoin to generate returns and support expansion without issuing new shares. “We’re mining bitcoin efficiently, holding it responsibly, and putting it to work in ways that drive shareholder value,” Bradford said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-hits-50-eh-s-hashrate-milestone,"BTC|MARKET|MINING","Markets|CleanSpark|Bitcoin Miner|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T17:43:02,"Banks Authorized For Crypto Activities, Confirms Federal Reserve Chair Powell","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced on Tuesday that banks will have the autonomy to determine their customer base, signaling an open door for digital asset investors and the introduction of new investment products centered around crypto assets. Freedom To Engage In Crypto Activities During his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell emphasized that banks are now positioned to offer banking services specifically tailored to the cryptocurrency industry and its associated companies. On Tuesday, Powell further stressed that these digital asset activities must be conducted with a focus on maintaining safety and soundness for everyday investors. This announcement follows the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to remove reputational risk from its bank examination criteria on Monday, a change that aligns with similar actions taken by other US banking regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Banks had expressed concerns that the previous emphasis on reputational risk could lead to subjective judgments from regulators, potentially penalizing institutions for engaging in legally permissible activities, including cryptocurrency, that do not pose significant financial risks. With the removal of this standard, the Federal Reserve has signaled a more lenient regulatory environment, allowing financial institutions to engage more freely in crypto-related projects and offerings. Inflation Forecast Addressing broader economic issues that can influence cryptocurrency prices, Powell highlighted ongoing concerns about inflation, which remains above the Fed’s target of 2%. The Fed chair noted that the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the economy is still uncertain, stating, “Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain.” Powell explained that the effects of tariffs will depend on their ultimate levels and that historically, tariffs have led to one-time price increases rather than sustained inflationary pressures. As for inflation metrics, Powell indicated that the Fed’s preferred measure is likely to rise to 2.3% in May, with the core measure—excluding food and energy—expected to edge up to 2.6%. In April, these figures were recorded at 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are carefully considering these dynamics and do not feel rushed to adjust policy until more data on the impact of tariffs becomes available.

2025-06-24T17:40:32,"Solana price gains 10% as SOL CME futures volume hits all-time high","Solana gained nearly 10% in the past 24 hours as upbeat sentiment drove cryptocurrencies higher—and as the altcoin’s futures volume on derivatives marketplace the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose to a new all-time high. Per data shared by on-chain and financial metrics platform Glassnode, Solana ( SOL ) CME Futures volume has hit 1.75 million contracts. The milestone, reached in the past 24 hours, coincided with a notable reversal for the SOL token. Its price bounced off lows of $125 in the wake of the Middle East conflict to hit highs of $146. At its current value, the altcoin is about 50% off its all-time high of $294 reached in January 2025.

Investors may be positioning ahead of a potential SOL price rebound. $SOL CME Futures volume just hit an all-time high of 1.75M contracts – the highest on record. This surge suggests institutional investors are positioning aggressively as price rebounds to ~$145. Track SOL derivatives data: https://t.co/yClXheGVZB pic.twitter.com/wmmA3kdwkB — glassnode (@glassnode) June 24, 2025 The SOL token last traded above $150 on June 20,2025, with the subsequent dump to lows of $125 coming amid the sell-off that also drove Bitcoin ( BTC ) to near $98k. But the benchmark digital asset has since bounced to above $105k, fueling gains across the crypto market . Solana’s gains have cut weekly losses for SOL price to under 1% as at the time of writing. CME Group announced the launch of SOL futures in March 2025, offering access to micro-sized contracts and larger-sized contracts. Market participants can choose between the 25 SOL micro-sized contract or the larger 500 SOL contract. “With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s global head of cryptocurrency products, said. After a slow start, with less than 400k in volume in April and May, the metric picked up and surpassed 1 million contracts this week. Analysts have opined that notable CME futures volume could be a signal for demand for Solana exchange-traded funds. Recently, experts gave SOL spot ETFs a 95% chance of approval in 2025. Coinglass data shows open interest in Solana has increased to over $6 billion. Meanwhile, derivatives volume has increased by more than 28% to $19.2 billion.

Just one day after announcing a $1 billion SPAC deal, ProCap scooped up 3,724 Bitcoin, locking in exposure for investors before markets could blink. According to a June 24 press release , Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC, LLC purchased 3,724 Bitcoins (BTC) at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per BTC on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after announcing its $1 billion SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The aggressive initial purchase, worth roughly $387 million, was funded directly from a $750 million capital raise disclosed as part of the SPAC deal. The newly created company plans to hold the full amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and is expected to continue accumulating after it transitions into ProCap Financial, Inc., a publicly traded entity focused on institutional-grade Bitcoin services. You might also like: Chainlink and Mastercard partner to enable onchain crypto purchases Anthony Pompliano’s billion-dollar bet on the new institutional standard For Pompliano and his team, the decision to buy and hold $387 million worth of Bitcoin as part of a long-term accumulation strategy is less about optics and more about conviction. In public remarks and SEC filings, ProCap has made it clear that it views BTC not just as an asset, but as a benchmark. “Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate,” the company stated—underscoring its belief that the cryptocurrency is no longer speculative, but rather the minimum acceptable performance standard for capital deployment. By frontloading its BTC treasury with millions worth of the original cryptocurrency instead of holding idle dollars post-raise, ProCap is signaling a departure from traditional finance’s risk-averse playbook and leaning into Bitcoin as a base-layer financial asset. This isn’t just theory. Since 2020, public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets have outperformed their cash-heavy peers by staggering margins. Strategy, the most aggressive corporate adopter, saw its stock surge more than 3,000% at one point, not because of its core software business, but because of its Bitcoin treasury. Now, ProCap is doubling down on the same playbook, but with a twist: It’s not just hoarding BTC: it’s building financial infrastructure around it.

This news has caused the company’s value, once a small UK-based web design business, to jump from £3.7 million to over £1 billion. This dramatic rise followed its decision to buy large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a new business strategy. Smarter Web Makes A Big Move into Bitcoin Treasury On Tuesday, Smarter Web announced it bought 196.9 more BTC for £15.2 million, equivalent to $20.3 million. The company now owns 543.52 Bitcoins. They paid an average price of £77,988 for each coin, about $104,450. So far, Smarter Web has invested £42.4 million, or $56.8 million, in Bitcoin. At the same time, the company continues to provide web design, development, and online marketing services. It also earns money through setup fees, yearly hosting charges, and optional monthly plans. However, since April, the company, like many others, has also focused on building a Bitcoin treasury . In 2023, Smarter Web started accepting Bitcoin payments, believing it would be necessary for the future financial system. Confidence Fueled By Long-Term Gains with BTC The Smarter Web Company shared a 10-year growth plan to expand its customer base through web services and buy more Bitcoin when the time is right. The goal is to increase the company’s value and deliver long-term returns to shareholders. Since starting this plan, the company has become the UK’s largest Bitcoin holder. After a reverse takeover, it began trading on the Aquis Stock Exchange on April 25 with a value of about £3.7 million ($5 million). After announcing its Bitcoin strategy, its stock price soared nearly 20,000%, pushing its company value above £1 billion, equivalent to $1.4 billion. Even after a recent drop, Smarter Web remains the top company listed on Aquis. Smarter Web Backed By Bitcoin Heavyweights The Smarter Web Company is not making these moves alone. It is working with UTXO Management, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm led by David Bailey. David Bailey also runs Bitcoin Magazine and founded Nakamoto, a company that recently secured $51.5 million through a private deal. Bailey and UTXO’s Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, are on the company’s board. UTXO also invested in Smarter Web before it went public and is involved in other Bitcoin firms like Metaplanet and The Blockchain Group. While Smarter Web believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is unconvinced. The agency has warned that this kind of investment is high risk due to Bitcoin’s price swings. Coinbase’s David Duong also warned that companies using borrowed money to buy crypto could pose financial risks. However, he noted that the danger is still relatively limited.

2025-06-24T17:15:02,"Something Funky Has Been Happening to the Bitcoin Markets Since 2021: Details","The number of Bitcoin (BTC) deposit addresses on exchanges has dropped sharply. Such a pattern points to a deepening long-term conviction among investors. Data reveals a dramatic reversal in behavior that began after the 2021 cycle peak. Between 2015 and 2021, the number of unique addresses depositing BTC to exchanges steadily increased, averaging 180,000 annually. However, since 2022, that trend has not only stalled, but it has declined consistently. BTC Exchange Deposit Trend Reverses According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the 10-year average now stands at approximately 90,000, while the current 30-day moving average is just 48,000. On a daily basis, the number of depositing addresses has dropped to around 37,000, recording a multi-year low. Analysts say that this indicates a growing preference for holding Bitcoin rather than trading it. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has played a key role, which gave institutional and retail investors access to BTC’s price performance without needing to move or manage the asset directly. Additionally, lower retail trading activity in the current cycle has reduced active deposit behavior. At the same time, an increasing number of investors, and even corporations , are adopting a savings-oriented approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative instrument. The report said, “These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value.” This sentiment in investor behavior is echoed on a macro scale. Bitcoin As Modern Reserve Asset Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic asset for nations seeking to strengthen economic resilience in the current global landscape, according to a recent report by CoinShares. The cryptocurrency’s potential to hedge inflation, diversify sovereign portfolios, and offer protection against geopolitical instability positions it as a modern complement to gold and foreign exchange reserves. While the US decision in 2025 to add Bitcoin to its reserves is a crucial moment, CoinShares noted that the ongoing skepticism among economists who highlight its volatility and speculative nature. Despite this, with rising global debt, inflation, and mounting geopolitical tensions, more governments are exploring alternatives. Brazil’s RESBit proposal and Russia’s reported interest in Bitcoin reserves suggest a competitive push to secure a share of the asset’s fixed supply. With a $2 trillion market cap and growing institutional presence, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible reserve option alongside traditional holdings.

The move seems to have largely erased recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment. Markets Gain As Tensions Ease Relief from the Middle East conflict in the form of a surprise ceasefire spurred a crypto and risk-asset rally. President Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump wrote. Crypto markets have turned nicely higher, with Bitcoin (BTC) now up by 5.1% over the past 24 hours to $106,017 after the brutal Sunday-Monday crash. The premier crypto had plummeted below the psychologically important $100,000 level on Sunday before staging its recovery. Bitcoin has historically trended positively during times of global unrest. During major events like the US–Iran conflict in 2020, Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022, and now the Iran–Israel war of 2025, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price stability. While it does not act like a traditional safe haven, it usually behaves like an uncorrelated hedge in systemic uncertainty. Ether (ETH), the industry’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is ahead 10.6% to trade back above $2,455. Ripple-promoted cryptocurrency XRP surged 11.2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto’s double-digit spike comes after Arthur Britto, co-founder of Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), posted on X for the first time in nearly 14 years.

2025-06-24T17:06:37,"Why is crypto up today? Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins see big gains","The overall crypto market cap rose 2.3% as traders hoped for de-escalation in the Middle East. Crypto markets saw notable gains on Tuesday, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the rally. On Tuesday, June 24, Bitcoin climbed 5.3%, rising back above $105,000. Altcoins performed even better, posting double-digit gains, with the total crypto market cap up 5.19%. Ethereum (ETH) was among the strongest performers, up 11.33%. Altcoins also saw big gains, with XRP (XRP) up 10.15%, Solana (SOL) rising 9.61%, and Cardano (ADA) up 9.4%. Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also saw strong growth, nearing double digits. The most likely catalyst for this rally was growing optimism that tensions in the Middle East are easing. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel be stricly respected on both sides. You might also like: Stablecoins and oil are Trump’s macro weapons, says DeVere CEO The ceasefire came after U.S. bombers targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, prompting a symbolic response from Iran via strikes on U.S. bases in Qatar. Iran reportedly gave ample warning, allowing U.S. personnel to evacuate and avoid escalation. This development brought relief to traders, as a prolonged war, especially one involving the U.S., threatened to destabilize the global economy. In particular, heightened tensions had driven up oil prices, stoking fears of rising global inflation. In particular, at one point, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of global oil production flows every day. In this environment, central banks are forced to raise interest rates, which hurts risk assets like crypto. You might also like: Oil, inflation, and Bitcoin are now locked in the same trade Where will Bitcoin and Ethereum go next? The ceasefire between Iran and Israel is fragile, as seen by Israeli strikes on Iran soon after Trump announced the deal. Still, an irate response from Trump seems to have caused Israel to back down. In any case, the risk of further escalation is lower now than it was two weeks ago. Traders, both retail and institutional, will now likely take a more risk-on approach. Future catalysts for growth include the GENIUS Act , which will bring the first regulatory framework for stablecoins to the U.S. Institutions will also likely continue to buy up Bitcoin for their treasuries.

Crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may enter a downward phase after hitting a historic peak level, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. “BTC dominance: if history repeats, the real altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin dominance rejects from 71% (red).” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC.D is a metric that calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are printing gains faster than BTC. The analyst also says BTC.D may not hit exactly 71% before reversing, but somewhere within that area. “There really is no point in arguing about whether BTC.D will ultimately top out at 71% or at 69% or at 67%. The majority of the Bitcoin dominance macro uptrend has already taken place. And just like in every BTC.D cycle, it got close to 71%.” Lastly, the analyst says that as BTC.D rises to its peak, altcoins won’t completely collapse in value, but may have significant corrections before the altseason begins. “This past February, Bitcoin dominance rallied from 58% to 64%. That’s a 6% increase. Now, Bitcoin dominance is only [5.7%] away from 71%. Altcoins won’t go to $0.00. Instead, [alts] may react similarly to February 2025.” Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 65.30%.

2025-06-24T16:55:29,"Dogwifhat Rockets 20% as Bitcoin Breaches $106K – Is a $1.00 Breakout Next?","Dogwifhat ($WIF) has rocketed 20% in 24 hours, punching past $0.86 as Bitcoin smashes $106K—putting the Solana meme coin within striking distance of the $1.00 milestone. The gains follow a sharp reversal from $WIF’s recent lows below $0.72, fueled by a 22% spike in active wallets and over $70M in daily volume. Analysts now watch the $0.83 support level, with a breakout potentially igniting a broader Solana meme coin rally. Market Position and Ecosystem Developments The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a strong resurgence, with $WIF maintaining a strong position. Currently ranked as the 45th-largest digital asset by market capitalization (~$1.76B), it trails giants like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) but continues to outpace competitors such as $FLOKI, $PEPE, and $BONK in terms of trading volume and visibility. wif just woke up from hibernation +up 24.1% today mcap: $865M 24h volume: $719M still the dog with the hat still barkin’ louder than the rest pic.twitter.com/RGJzSIJRBO — madmix (@madmixnum) June 24, 2025 The past 48 hours have seen particularly strong network activity, with daily trading volume surpassing $700 million and a 22% increase in active wallets interacting with $WIF liquidity pools. The project’s ecosystem continues to expand through strategic partnerships and integrations. Since its November 2024 listing on Robinhood, $WIF has gained improved accessibility for retail traders. Community Strength and Future Outlook The community engagement around $WIF sets it apart in the crowded meme coin space. While many meme coins rise and fall with the whims of internet hype, $WIF has shown an impressive ability to stay put, owing to a community that’s as creative as it is committed. Instead of being driven by a central team, $WIF’s momentum comes from the grassroots: token holders have come together to fund everything from eye-catching billboards to exclusive merch drops, all in the name of spreading the word and having fun. Looking ahead, $WIF’s journey will depend on a few key factors. Its price action is closely linked to Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $106,000 and the ongoing strength of the Solana ecosystem. Any new exchange listings or partnership news could give $WIF an extra boost, while shifts in social chatter and trading volume will offer important hints about whether this rally is built to last. Even with a promising technical setup, savvy traders know that meme coins are never a sure thing—volatility is part of the game. That’s why smart risk management is as important as optimism, especially when the market feels bullish. All eyes will be on $WIF in the coming week. If it can hold its current ground, a push toward the $1.00 mark could be in the cards—a move that would almost certainly turn heads and spark even more excitement around this community-driven coin. Technical Breakout Points to Further Potential The current price action reveals a compelling technical story for $WIF. The coin has successfully broken out from a descending wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic bullish reversal formation that has developed over the past week. Source: TradingView This breakout was confirmed when $WIF decisively cleared the $0.83 resistance level, accompanied by increased trading volume that lends credibility to the move. The Relative Strength Index, while rising, remains comfortably below overbought territory at 62, suggesting there is still room for upward movement before the asset becomes technically extended. $WIF | @dogwifcoin Holding the 0.702 Fib…For Now One Last Shakeout Likely Moon-Shot Loading pic.twitter.com/WSOn51xcYM — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) June 23, 2025 Looking at key price levels, traders are now watching the $0.91 mark, representing a Fibonacci retracement level from June’s price action, followed by the psychologically key $1.00 threshold. The measured move from the wedge pattern’s breakout point suggests potential for $WIF to test these levels in the near term . However, should the price fail to maintain its footing above $0.83, we could see a retest of support levels at $0.78 or even a return to the $0.72 base that marked recent lows.

Useless Coin ( USELESS ), a meme coin on Solana ( SOL ), jumped to a high of $0.1462, up by 2,470% from its lowest point this month. This surge has pushed its market cap to over $133 million. The token surge accelerated as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins rose following Israel’s truce with Iran. It also jumped after two Fed officials, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, said that they would support an interest rate cut of 0.25% in the July meeting. Nansen data shows that whales have continued accumulating the token this week. Their holdings rose by 15% in the last 30 days to 381 million. Whale holdings are among the most popular bullish signals, as these investors are seen as more experienced than retail traders.

Additional data shows that exchange balances of the Useless token have dropped by 13% in the last 30 days to 51.4 million. Useless Coin’s price is also rising likely due to Fear of Missing Out among retail investors. It’s common for newly launched tokens to rally as investors speculate it might be the next big thing. In most cases, however, these surges are short-lived, with tokens often pulling back as early investors take profits. A notable example is Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which surged in its early days in January before plunging.

It has climbed from a low of $0.00546 in June to a high of $0.1462. The token has rallied above both the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages. It has also broken above the upper side of an ascending channel. Useless Coin’s Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator have both moved into overbought territory.

2025-06-24T16:40:08,"Expert Decodes Ripple Co-founder’s Message to the XRP Community","Arthur Britto, one of the elusive co-founders of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), stunned the crypto world by breaking a 14-year silence with a single post on X—an emoji: . Though minimal, this gesture has sparked widespread interpretation, particularly by prominent influencer Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem. Her analysis suggests Britto’s post may be a deliberate signal of support for Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin investor now facing legal battles. The implications are profound, tying together Ripple’s history, founding vision, and the current state of crypto justice. Arthur Britto: The Silent Visionary Arthur Britto is famously private. He has never granted interviews, has no known public images, and follows only two accounts on X: Ripple Custody CEO Jack McDonald and Roger Ver. His most notable public commentary dates back to 2013, when he described XRP as “the plumbing you don’t see,” suggesting it was designed to work silently in the background. Though I may be mistaken, I believe @ahbritto ’s use of the no mouth emoji signals a very noteworthy point. Arthur, who follows only @_JackMcDonald_ and @rogerkver , seems to underscore Roger’s current struggle. Jack led his groundbreaking technology alongside @JoelKatz , while… pic.twitter.com/bSZTtR6Sz9 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 24, 2025 Given this long-standing silence, Britto’s recent emoji post carries significant weight. Crypto Eri’s interpretation of the “no mouth” emoji is that it reflects silence, censorship, or suppressed truth, a potential nod to Roger Ver’s current struggle. Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Roger Ver, once dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus,” played a key role in Ripple’s early development. He was one of its first investors, providing critical funding that helped launch the XRPL in 2012. Today, he faces serious legal trouble. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged him with tax evasion and mail fraud, alleging he failed to pay nearly $48 million in exit taxes after renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014. Ver was arrested in Spain in April 2024 and now faces possible extradition. His supporters argue that the charges are politically motivated and that the government is targeting him for his libertarian beliefs and outspoken stance against U.S. financial oversight. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Symbol Ripple CTO David Schwartz has also spoken out in defense of Ver, stating the case is “way more evil than most people realize.” He emphasized Ver’s integrity and his vital role in both Bitcoin and Ripple’s early days. Now, Britto’s silent post appears to reinforce that sentiment. Crypto Eri’s commentary highlights the deeper meaning behind the emoji. She compares the situation to the campaign for Ross Ulbricht’s release, suggesting the crypto community should rally similarly behind Roger Ver. Britto, through his rare appearance, may be encouraging that same sense of solidarity. The Bigger Message Britto’s post is more than just a cryptic emoji; it is a powerful, silent protest. As one of Ripple’s founding minds, his subtle gesture echoes a call for justice and fair treatment, not just for Roger Ver, but for any individual caught at the intersection of innovation and regulation. Crypto Eri’s interpretation resonates deeply across the XRP community. In a space where symbols often speak louder than words, Britto’s emoji may stand as one of the clearest statements yet: fairness matters, and the community must remain vigilant. In the end, the message is clear—even the quietest voices can carry the loudest truths. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-24T16:30:17,"Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000?","Ethereum’s price action in the past 24 hours has been characterized by a fall toward $2,100 before rebounding to the upside very quickly. Ethereum’s price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum’s next major target around $6,000. Wave A Complete, But Downside Likely Before Rally The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum’s price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets Now that the Wave A pattern is complete, the prediction is a short-term bounce to as high as $2,792 as part of a wave B retracement. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. This level is what the analyst refers to as his “ideal buy zone” for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete. Wyckoff Structure Points $6,000 ETH Price Merlijn, a popular analyst on X, shared a contrasting yet converging perspective. In this case, the analyst’s outlook is based on Wyckoff’s accumulation framework. Merlijn stated, “Ethereum: Wyckoff says go.” Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to the daily price chart that followed his analysis, the analyst showed that the crypto had already completed the spring and test phases, which are both components of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. What comes next, according to the Wyckoff method, is the markup phase. The chart Merlijn posted aligns with this outlook. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in. Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,420, up by 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-24T16:23:09,"Analyst sets new date when Bitcoin will hit $130,000","With Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaiming the $105,000 level, a trading expert is projecting the cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 within weeks. The forecast follows Bitcoin’s rebound from its one-day Exponential Moving Average 100 (EMA), a key trend line that has historically marked the beginning of major bull runs, according to a June 24 TradingView analysis by TradingShot . The rebound also coincided with a de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two nations. Technically, the EMA100 has served as a critical support level since Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022. Since then, each major rally has either originated from or touched this moving average, triggering strong upward moves. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin dipped slightly below the EMA100 in the first bullish wave before rallying to the 1.382 Fibonacci extension . The second wave bounced directly off the EMA100 and reached the 1.618 level. In the third leg, the price came close to the trend line before surging toward the 2.0 Fibonacci extension. Bitcoin is forming a fourth bullish channel, mirroring the previous patterns. TradingShot noted that each rally has produced progressively higher Fibonacci peaks, suggesting the current move could surpass the 2.0 level of around $168,000. However, the analysis offers a more conservative near-term target of $130,000, aligned with the 1.382 Fibonacci extension, which could be reached by early August 2025. Bitcoin FUD moment Meanwhile, a similar analysis by Ted Pillows, shared in an X post on June 24, suggests that Bitcoin’s current price behavior indicates every major Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) event has historically marked the asset’s bottom, often preceding strong recoveries. Key events such as the 2023 Silvergate liquidity scare, the 2022 FTX collapse, the 2024 Japan Carry Trade unwind, Trump’s tariff announcement, and the recent U.S.-Iran conflict have all aligned with significant price lows. Pillows noted that with signs of de-escalation in global tensions, especially the recent ceasefire, Bitcoin may have already reached its bottom or is nearing it. https://twitter.com/TedPillows/status/1937480575079841965 Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,490, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours, while in the past week, the asset 1.1%.

2025-06-24T16:15:48,"Bitcoin Mining Profitability Records Almost 20% Spike: Report","According to a Jefferies report, Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability reportedly recorded almost a 20% uptick. This surge coincided with a nearly equal spike in the price of flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin and a modest gain in the network hashrate. BTC Price Increases as Gold Price Spikes On Monday, investment firm Jefferies published a research report detailing Bitcoin mining progress. BTC mining profitability rose by 18.2% in May while the network hashrate gained 3.5%. This hashrate is the collective computational power used to mine and process transactions on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain like Bitcoin. Apart from the increase in hashrate, which serves as a proxy for competition amongst miners, Bitcoin price registered some profits, spurred by the recent rally in gold price . For context, investors turned to inflation-protected assets with the spike in gold prices. According to Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul, analysts from Jeffries, this move was in anticipation of a ballooning fiscal deficit in the United States, amongst other countries. MARA Holdings and CleanSpark Leads US-listed Mining Companies Jeffries’ report also listed the volume of Bitcoin mined by US mining companies last month. All the US-listed mining facilities mined a total of 3,754 BTC. According to the report, this is a notable increase compared to April, when they only mined 3,278 BTC. On the other hand, miners in North America made up 26.3% of the total network in May, compared to 24.1% the previous month. Out of this group, MARA Holdings (MARA) mined 950 Bitcoin, marking a 35% increase from April. It has successfully raised its total reserves to 49,179 BTC. It was followed by CleanSpark (CLSK) at 694 mined Bitcoin. It is worth noting that MARA’s hashrate is still the largest at 58.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Records Slight Decline Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty has recorded a slight decline following a record high. This outlook offers some relief to miners, especially those who are dealing with rising costs and reduced block rewards. In mid-June, CryptoQuant shared data showing that the mining difficulty stood at around 126.4 trillion. This was just below the All-Time High (ATH) of 126.9 trillion recorded on May 31. Mining difficulty adjusts every two weeks to ensure that new blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. This is regardless of how much computing power is in the network. Therefore, the new mining difficulty record is expected in a few days.

2025-06-24T16:13:54,"Japan’s FSA proposes classifying cryptocurrencies as financial products","Regulators in Japan want to reclassify the legal status of cryptocurrencies as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The proposal , introduced by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on June 24, is part of a broader push to align the country’s financial system with its “New Capitalism” strategy, which aims to transform Japan into a more investment-driven economy. Under the proposed changes, cryptocurrencies would move from the existing regulatory scope of the Payment Services Act to the more comprehensive Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), the same framework that governs securities and traditional financial products. If adopted, this would allow for the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan and reduce the capital gains tax on crypto from a rate of up to 55% to a flat 20%, putting it in line with taxation on stock investments. Among other provisions are plans to establish a dedicated working group to examine the proposed reclassification and oversee regulatory developments. In the policy document, the FSA has highlighted how crypto adoption in the country has seen a noticeable uptick over the past years. As of January 2025, over 12.1 million domestic crypto accounts were active, and crypto holdings on platforms exceeded 5 trillion yen (approximately $34 billion). The FSA said that crypto ownership has outpaced participation in traditional instruments such as FX trading and corporate bonds, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. With this proposal, Japan hopes to catch up with the progress made across leading economies like the United States, where Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products have seen great success. Citing data from March 2025, the FSA pointed to more than 1,200 financial institutions, including U.S. pension funds and Goldman Sachs, now holding U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. Japan advances crypto regulations Before unveiling its June proposal, FSA had already moved to redefine crypto through a draft framework categorising tokens by function and structure. At the time, the FSA proposed classifying tokens based on their economic role and governance model, separating fundraising assets, labeled Type 1, from decentralized, non-fundraising tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, now referred to as Type 2. Japanese regulators have warmed up to the crypto sector over the past years, and there have been growing calls within policymaking circles to recognise digital assets as a legitimate component of the financial system. The Bank of Japan, for instance, has warned that in a highly digitized society, trust in fiat currency could erode if central banks fail to ensure price stability. According to Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida, in such scenarios, cryptocurrencies or stablecoins could eventually fill the gap, posing a credible alternative to sovereign money in the eyes of future generations. Separately, Japan became one of the first countries to approve a stablecoin license under its updated rules. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, was licensed to handle stablecoins and said it was preparing to support Circle’s USDC.

2025-06-24T16:11:59,"Metaplanet Hits 11,111 BTC Milestone — Follow the Smart Money Into These Crypto Assets","Metaplanet’s milestone of acquiring 11,111 BTC is more than just a number—it’s a signal that institutional conviction in crypto remains strong. As major players quietly accumulate, savvy investors are scanning the horizon for undervalued assets with breakout potential. In this article, we spotlight three crypto projects that mirror the “smart money” logic: fundamentally solid, technically oversold, and primed for explosive upside once momentum shifts. Worldcoin (WLD): Oversold and Ready for a Reversal? Source: tradingview Worldcoin is currently trading between $0.73 and $0.98, reflecting sustained downward pressure—but also creating a potential entry zone for bold investors. While the coin is down over 34% this past month and nearly 60% across six months, the RSI is starting to hint at early buyer interest. A breakout above the $1.13 resistance could trigger a rally toward $1.38, offering a gain of nearly 40% from current levels. As Worldcoin continues pushing its identity-based crypto vision and gains media visibility, a momentum shift could quickly flip the narrative. Oversold assets often make the loudest comebacks—and WLD might just be setting the stage. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): AI Sector Favorite Eyes Next Leg Up Source: tradingview FET is currently trading between $0.51 and $0.70, showing consolidation after a prolonged pullback. Although down over 20% this month and nearly 50% over six months, the RSI at 58 suggests mild bullish momentum building. A push past $0.82 resistance could unlock a move toward $1.01, offering potential upside of up to 60%. As AI continues to dominate both tech and crypto narratives, FET stands out as a leader in decentralized superintelligence. For investors tracking ""smart money"" sectors, AI tokens like FET remain at the top of the watchlist. Ethena (ENA): Deep Discount with High-Reward Potential Source: tradingview Ethena is hovering in a tight band between $0.20 and $0.30 after dropping more than 70% over six months—but this might present a strong accumulation zone. The RSI remains low, hinting at oversold conditions and growing buyer interest. A breakout past $0.35 could spark a rally to $0.45, representing a 50% upside from current prices. As a synthetic dollar project with strong fundamentals and a growing DeFi presence, ENA could be poised for a sharp recovery when market sentiment turns. For those who follow big-picture fundamentals, this may be a low-risk, high-reward setup. Conclusion While Metaplanet sets the tone with bold Bitcoin accumulation, the real alpha may lie in assets still flying under the radar. Worldcoin, FET, and Ethena each offer compelling setups—steep discounts, improving indicators, and alignment with major crypto narratives like AI, identity, and DeFi. As the market shifts from fear to opportunity, these tokens could be next in line for aggressive moves. Smart money isn’t just watching Bitcoin—it’s hunting for the next breakout story.

2025-06-24T16:05:07,"What Tariffs Will — and Won’t — Change for U.S. Bitcoin Miners","Will tariffs end the golden age of bitcoin mining in America? After China banned crypto in the summer of 2021, a huge chunk of the mining industry was forced to relocate — to Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada and other countries with cheap electricity. The biggest beneficiary of this exodus, however, was the United States, which over the last four years has overtaken every other country in the world in terms of hashrate (meaning that more bitcoin is produced in the U.S. than anywhere else). Yet President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, unveiled on April 2 but paused for the time being, threaten to increase the costs of ASICs , the extremely powerful computers used to produce bitcoin. Only a handful of companies know how to build these ASICs, and the majority of their manufacturing facilities are located in Southeast Asia, in nations that face roughly 10% to 50% tariffs. While the new taxes probably won’t make it prohibitively expensive for U.S.-based miners to import new machines, they will likely slow down the industry’s expansion in the country, multiple experts told CoinDesk. “The U.S. is still going to be the major source of hashrate globally for the foreseeable future, but its overarching dominance will likely erode as bitcoin mining becomes a much more global business,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Synteq Digital. “We're certainly going to see U.S. hashrate plateau in terms of relative growth,” he added. “Other countries are coming into the space in a big way. Pakistan just announced it will dedicate two gigawatts of power to bitcoin mining. There are all sorts of projects happening in Ethiopia and abroad. They will certainly take up quite a bit of hashrate capacity growth.” Tariffs are only a piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, such as the enormous demand for new data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and the diminishing number of ideal U.S. locations for firms to set up mining facilities, are likely to have a larger impact on a miner’s calculations when it comes to choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate. U.S.-based operations are still, in the short-term, able to tap into a robust secondary market in order to acquire mining rigs without paying tariffs. In the long-term, ASIC manufacturers are taking steps to produce their machines on U.S. soil. The consensus seems to be that, far from destroying bitcoin mining in the U.S., tariffs are simply shaping up to be a new variable that the quick-moving, hyper-competitive industry has to contend with. Biting the bullet Tariffs mostly presented a challenge to miners in April because of how sudden and steep they were. Miners and logistics companies rushed to push ASIC shipments into the U.S. before the policy’s implementation in order to avoid paying substantial taxes — only for the White House to push the deadline back a few months. Now, however, mining firms have adapted to the idea that imported ASICs will cost at least 10% more than they used to. But there is uncertainty as to whether this is the new normal. The Trump administration is still in the midst of trade negotiations, and the court system has yet to provide a definite ruling on the lawfulness of its new policies. “It’s likely going to take a long time for us to have a definitive answer on what tariffs will look like — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in,” Lauren Lin, head of hardware at bitcoin hardware firm Luxor Technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We expect it to take a few months, even over a year.” In the meantime, Luxor (which also runs a freight-forwarding business) isn’t seeing any signs of panic among its clients, though there has been an uptick in questions on how to prepare for Washington’s policy changes, according to Lin. Nor is the ASIC secondary market (where U.S.-based firms can acquire pre-owned, cheaper machines) slowing down, she said. In other words, miners are plodding along. But there are new difficulties, like the fact that tariffs also impact imported electrical hardware. Transformers, for example, are mostly manufactured overseas and were already difficult to obtain before April. Tariffs have only worsened the situation. This has been a bigger source of frustration for miners than tariffs on ASICs, according to an individual who works for a crypto trade organization. Overall, the White House’s initial tariffs on Southeast Asian nations should only be seen as a starting point for a policy that will likely evolve over time, Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at bitcoin miner Bitdeer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We're pretty optimistic that there'll be a reasonable outcome at the end of this,” he said. Made in America The $30 billion ASIC market is dominated by Bitmain, a Chinese firm whose machines power roughly 80% of Bitcoin’s hashrate , according to TheMinerMag. Its competitors include MicroBT, Canaan and Bitdeer. These companies manufacture the vast majority of their ASICs in Malaysia, Thailand and China, though MicroBT already has at least one facility in Pennsylvania, and Bitmain announced in December that it was launching a new production line in the United States. Canaan has also completed a U.S. trial run, meaning that it now has the capacity to build ASICs in the country if it chooses to. The Trump administration’s tariffs are accomplishing one of their stated objectives (to boost U.S. industry) in that they’re incentivizing these ASIC manufacturers to scale up their operations in the country. Canaan told CoinDesk that, while production in the U.S. is costly, it brings the advantages of being geographically closer to their customers and of reducing supply chain risks. The firm said that it is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with existing U.S.-based manufacturers for its own purposes. MicroBT is also looking into ways to avoid tariffs by ramping up U.S. production. Bitdeer, a new but technologically advanced player in the ASIC scene , is looking at the situation as an opportunity to seize market share from the incumbents. “We'd like to migrate as much as we can to the U.S.,” LaBerge said. “It will take some time to ramp that up.” “Being a manufacturer and a miner gives us tremendous optionality, because we'll always have a home for the rigs that we produce, whether it's in our own data centers or with a third party,” he added. Bitdeer has mining operations in Texas and Ohio, among other locations. The heavyweight, Bitmain, has not communicated new plans to ramp up U.S. production since tariffs were announced in April. But the company will likely want to demonstrate that it’s building in the U.S. in accordance with the Trump administration’s goals, Synteq’s Kulyk said. Bitmain did not respond to a request for comment. In any case, the consensus seems to be that expanding production capacity in the U.S. will be a slow and costly process. “Whether we scale our machine manufacturing in the U.S. depends on our ability to cut costs as well as demand from our U.S. customers. If demand from U.S. customers is low, manufacturing here doesn't make sense,” Canaan told CoinDesk. “In addition, if tariffs on products from Southeast Asia [end up being] low, then we don't necessarily need to build up our manufacturing capabilities in the United States.” The end of a golden age? So miners are quickly adapting to the new reality of tariffs, and ASIC manufacturers look ready to ramp up local production. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s U.S.-based hashrate ( currently worth over 40% of global hashrate ) is unlikely to keep growing as fast as it has in the last four years. For one thing, tariffs do have an impact. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and companies are always looking for ways to cut costs. If the choice is between opening a new mining facility in Texas or in Ontario, tariffs may swing the decision in favour of the latter. More important, however, is the fact that it’s getting harder to find new U.S. locations that meet the necessary requirements for spinning up new bitcoin mining operations. “Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked in the U.S.,” LaBerge said. Not to mention that competition has become more intense. Data centers dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) are popping up all over the country in order to scale AI capabilities, and the industry’s major players — Microsoft, Meta, Google — are deep-pocketed. If a site is suitable for both mining and HPC, the miners are unlikely to win a bidding war. Nor would they necessarily want to. HPC data centers are more complex and capital intensive to build , but they also bring in much higher profits; this has led a number of bitcoin mining firms to diversify into AI. “HPC chasing electrons is the main theme for the next two to 10 years,” Kulyk told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin miners most certainly have targets on their backs for acquisition and consolidation in the space… As a sector, they will likely get eaten or absorbed into overall digital compute.” This phenomenon is likely to stay contained to the U.S. because of the technical sophistication required to build and run HPC centers. Political considerations also play a big part, considering the ongoing AI arms race between the U.S. and China. In other words, bitcoin miners outside of the U.S. won’t be impacted by the rapid growth of the HPC industry the same way. For U.S.-based miners, the path forward may no longer be expanding in terms of megawatts, but in terms of efficiency, according to LaBerge. “If you look at the global hashrate right now… the majority of rigs have an efficiency of 30 joules per terahash (J/TH) or higher,” he said. For comparison, Bitmain and Bitdeer’s latest generation machines are closer to 10 J/TH in efficiency. “In today’s economics, that’s marginally profitable at best.” “All of those rigs need to be refreshed,” he continued. “We see this as a $4-6 billion a year addressable market for the next three to five years.” CORRECTION (June 24, 2025, 16:30 UTC): Canaan isn't looking into building its own U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, as previously stated by the article, but is mulling the idea of partnering with existing U.S. manufacturers.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/06/24/what-tariffs-will-and-wont-change-for-us-bitcoin-miners,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News Analysis|Bitcoin Mining|ASIC|Exclusive|Feature",cryptocompare

After these approvals, ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL) are also expected to be approved. While the ETF movement in the USA has become an example for other countries, Japan has also opened the doors to ETFs. Japan's Financial Services Agency has published a proposal today to include cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, local news agency Coinpost reported. At this point, the proposal proposes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin be recognized as “financial products” under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which regulates securities and traditional financial products. The proposal, which will be reviewed by the Financial System Council tomorrow, June 25, could pave the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs in Japan and allow crypto gains to be taxed at a flat 20% rate instead of the current graduated tax rate of up to 55%. It was stated that this change could make BTC and crypto investments more attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Finally, experts predict that if the proposal submitted in Japan is accepted and cryptocurrencies are treated as a financial product, it will pave the way for regulated crypto investment vehicles. It was stated that this could mean that spot Bitcoin ETFs, something that Japan has been holding back for years, could finally get approval. *This is not investment advice.

Less than 24 hours after revealing a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. (CCCM) and a separate $775 million capital raise, the firm snapped up 3,724 bitcoin BTC at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per coin. The purchase kicks off a treasury program that could swell to $1 billion in bitcoin once the SPAC transaction closes and the combined company, to be called ProCap Financial, lists on Nasdaq. It comes after the company revealed it raised $550 million through a preferred equity offering and an additional $225 million in convertible notes. If the company was already publicly traded, it would rank as the 14th biggest BTC holder among listed companies, just below Semler Scientific, according to Bitcointreasuries.com.

2025-06-24T15:36:37,"Pompliano’s ProCap SPAC Aims for $1B Bitcoin Treasury Splash","Crypto investor and podcast host Anthony Pompliano is taking the MicroStrategy playbook to Wall Street's next level, raising $750 million to go public with his Bitcoin-native financial platform ProCap via a SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The deal, which was announced Monday, will see ProCap Financial go public on Nasdaq with a plan to rapidly buy and hold up to $1 billion of Bitcoin—about an eighth of Michael Saylor's legendary hoard—making it among the biggest BTC treasuries to list on public markets in history. Deal Structure: How ProCap Is Going Public ProCap's route to the public markets is a conventional SPAC play with a cryptocurrency twist. The $750 million financing consists of $516.5 million in equity and $235 million of convertible notes, with U.S. Bank as collateral agent and trustee. Unusually, ProCap is investing $516.5 million to buy Bitcoin within 15 days of signing, giving investors immediate BTC exposure even before the closing of the merger. The convertible notes are 130% convertible and 2x collateralized in cash or Bitcoin, giving institutional backers downside protection. Upon merging, ProCap Financial will be led by Pompliano, offering not just a humongous Bitcoin reserve but also a series of BTC-denominated financial products—lending, trading, and capital markets—to generate yield and profits off its balance sheet. Why SPACs Are Back—And Why Crypto Loves Them SPACs, or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, are making a comeback in 2025 after a two-year absence, with the help of a better regulatory climate and a slowdown in traditional IPOs. SPACs offer crypto firms a short-cut to the public markets, sidestepping the lengthy and costly IPO route. ProCap's transaction is the largest initial raise for a publicly listed Bitcoin treasury business thus far, demonstrating Wall Street's appetites for risk and digital assets once more. The property is also a testament to the growing ”Bitcoin treasury” trend, spearheaded by MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and holding over 592,000 BTC. ProCap's $1 billion target would represent about 12.5% of Saylor's stack and be among the largest corporate BTC holders globally. Regulatory Hurdles and Listing-Day Pricing Even with the hype, the deal is under quite high regulatory scrutiny. The transaction is expected to be finalized in 2025, pending shareholder approval and SEC approval. According to experts, although the SPAC framework allows for speed, it also brings scrutiny—especially for crypto firms that are grappling with evolving custody, accounting, and reporting requirements. ProCap's hiring of U.S. Bank as collateral agent and its spot BTC buying initiative are meant to appease regulators and investors both. Valuation will be done on the final closing price of BTC bought, but with Bitcoin above $100,000, the market capitalization of ProCap can equal or even surpass some traditional financial institutions. Listing will come with the ticker $CCCM and provides shareholders with near-immediate exposure to BTC. SPACs, Bitcoin Treasuries, and Wall Street's Crypto Pivot ProCap's flashy entrance is symptomatic of a broader phenomenon: public companies vying to be ”Bitcoin proxies” for investors who would like exposure to digital currencies without the hassle of wallets or exchanges. More than 70 public companies collectively now hold over $67 billion in BTC, and 30+ new crypto treasury transactions have been announced since April. The SPAC route is specially attractive with Wall Street banks and institutional investors becoming friendly to the space and the Trump administration's light regulatory touch inviting new listings. While the SPAC renaissance and ProCap's aggressive listing have sparked the market, some experts warn against forces of a bubble and savvy risk management. ”There's an old George Soros quote: When I see a bubble, I buy,” Pompliano joked, ”because the trend works.” However, ProCap's successful listing will be contingent upon regulatory openness, timing in the markets, and learning how to generate yield from its BTC stack—something even Saylor's Strategy now attempts to accomplish. Bottom Line Pompliano's ProCap SPAC is a landmark for Bitcoin public market adoption and the return of SPACs to Wall Street's main stage. With $750 million in capital and a $1 billion BTC target, ProCap stands poised to raise the bar for corporate crypto treasuries—if it can clear the regulatory hurdle and fulfill its bold vision.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9690/pompliano-s-pro-cap-spac-aims-for-1-b-bitcoin-treasury-splash,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T15:26:34,"CZ hypes ‘BNB MicroStrategy’ as corporate reserve interest grows","Former Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao is cheering the growing institutional spotlight on BNB as more firms move to tap the token as a reserve asset. In a July 24 X post, Zhao praised China-based Labs cryptocurrency-mining chip designer Nano Labs for its vision to launch a BNB ( BNB ) focused strategic reserve. The Binance founder’s applause follows Nano Labs’ announcement earlier that day of a $500 million convertible note raise, with plans to acquire up to $1 billion worth of BNB over time. According to the company, it aims to hold 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply and position the token as a long-term treasury asset. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1937468397891256476 While CZ clarified that neither he nor any affiliated entities took part in the raise, he described the move as a major vote of confidence for BNB’s future and expressed support for the vision. You might also like: BNB flashes a golden cross as DEX volume soars ahead of Maxwell upgrade The comments build on his previous nod to a similar initiative. Former Coral Capital Holdings executives were recently reported to be raising $100 million through a Nasdaq-listed entity to accumulate BNB as part of a similar institutional reserve strategy. “BNB ‘MicroStrategy’ coming to a company near you!” cheered the Binance founder. He further emphasized that more institutions around the world are mulling the same idea, adding that the rising interest may soon mark a turning point for the token. A new narrative for BNB? Institutional adoption played a defining role in Bitcoin’s rise, and a similar wave of interest may now be forming around BNB. Still, doubts remain. Although BNB is described as a public, blockchain-native token not affiliated with Binance, its ties to the exchange have long weighed on its image. This is largely due to the exchange’s regulatory troubles and lingering concerns about the token’s distribution and decentralization, fueling investor skepticism. That cautious sentiment is reflected in BNB’s stunted growth over the past year, lagging behind many of its peers in both performance and market enthusiasm. However, some believe that the recent wave of institutional interest could promote adoption, helping it carve out an identity beyond Binance’s shadow.

2025-06-24T15:20:28,"Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Shift: Ending ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision","BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Shift: Ending ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant development that could reshape how digital asset firms interact with traditional banking. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, has just made a pivotal announcement: it will no longer consider “reputational risk” as a standalone factor in its bank supervision guidelines. This move, initially brought to light by Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a profound shift, particularly for crypto firms that have long struggled with banking access. Understanding the Shift in Federal Reserve Guidelines For years, the term “reputational risk” has been a contentious point in the banking sector, especially concerning businesses deemed “high-risk” or “novel” – a category into which many cryptocurrency companies often fell. This vague classification allowed banks to deny services to crypto firms, citing potential damage to their public image, even if the firms themselves were operating legally and compliantly. This often led to the frustrating phenomenon known as “debanking.” The Federal Reserve’s decision means this subjective criterion is being removed from their official bank examination manuals. Instead, examiners will now be retrained to focus solely on concrete financial risks, such as money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing – risks that are quantifiable and can be mitigated through established compliance protocols. This change represents a crucial step towards creating a more objective and fair banking environment for all legitimate businesses, including those in the digital asset space. The Impact of Ending Reputational Risk for Crypto Firms The removal of “reputational risk” from the Fed’s lexicon is a monumental victory for the crypto industry. Historically, many legitimate crypto businesses, from exchanges to blockchain developers, found themselves shut out of traditional banking services. This wasn’t necessarily due to actual financial misconduct but rather a perception of risk or a lack of understanding from financial institutions. Increased Banking Access: This change could open doors for crypto firms that previously struggled to secure bank accounts, loans, and other essential financial services. Banks might now be more willing to engage with crypto businesses without the looming threat of regulatory scrutiny based on subjective reputational concerns. Reduced Debanking: The practice of “debanking,” where banks unilaterally terminate relationships with crypto companies, is expected to decrease. This provides much-needed stability and predictability for an industry that thrives on innovation but has been hampered by banking instability. Level Playing Field: By focusing on tangible financial risks, the Fed is helping to create a more level playing field. Crypto firms, like any other business, will now be evaluated based on their adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, rather than on their perceived “newness” or “riskiness” by association. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about legitimizing an entire sector. When crypto firms can access banking services, they can operate more efficiently, grow, and contribute more effectively to the broader economy. It’s a clear signal that regulators are moving towards integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system, albeit cautiously. How Bank Supervision is Evolving The Federal Reserve is not acting in isolation. It is the last major U.S. financial regulator to make this specific change, following in the footsteps of others like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This concerted effort across multiple regulatory bodies suggests a unified approach to modernizing bank supervision and fostering innovation responsibly. The evolution of bank supervision can be seen in several key shifts: From Subjective to Objective: Moving away from vague “reputational” concerns towards measurable financial risks. Focus on Risk Management: Emphasizing robust internal controls, compliance programs, and due diligence processes within banks. Technological Adaptation: Regulators are increasingly understanding the nuances of blockchain technology and digital assets, leading to more informed policy decisions. This evolving landscape requires banks to adapt their internal frameworks. Instead of simply avoiding crypto, they must now develop sophisticated risk assessment models that can accurately evaluate the financial crime risks associated with digital asset transactions. This encourages banks to become more knowledgeable about the crypto space, which can only benefit the ecosystem in the long run. Addressing Crypto Debanking : A Historical Perspective The issue of crypto debanking has been a persistent thorn in the side of the digital asset industry for years. Many crypto businesses, even those with strong compliance frameworks, found themselves without banking partners. This was often driven by a combination of factors: Regulatory Uncertainty: A lack of clear guidelines from regulators made banks hesitant to engage with crypto. Perceived High Risk: The nascent nature of the industry and its association with illicit activities (even if a small percentage) led to a blanket classification of “high risk.” Operational Burden: Banks found it complex and costly to implement the necessary AML/KYC procedures for crypto businesses, often opting to avoid them entirely. “Reputational Risk” Concerns: The fear that associating with crypto could damage their standing with customers or regulators was a significant deterrent. The Federal Reserve’s latest move directly addresses the fourth point, removing a major hurdle. This historical context underscores the significance of the Fed’s decision. It’s not just a minor policy tweak; it’s a direct response to years of advocacy from the crypto industry and a recognition of the need for a more balanced regulatory approach. What Does This Mean for US Financial Regulators and the Future? With the Federal Reserve now aligning with other major US financial regulators on this specific issue, there’s a clearer, more consistent message being sent to the banking industry: don’t debank legitimate businesses simply because of their industry. Instead, focus on effective risk management. This convergence among regulators bodes well for the future of crypto in the United States. It suggests a growing maturity in regulatory thinking, moving from outright avoidance or extreme caution to a more nuanced approach that seeks to integrate digital assets responsibly into the financial system. Key Takeaways for the Future: Increased Clarity: Banks can expect more consistent guidance from regulators regarding how to engage with crypto firms. Innovation Encouraged: A more stable banking environment could foster greater innovation within the crypto space, as businesses can operate with more confidence. Continued Scrutiny on Financial Risks: While “reputational risk” is out, the focus on robust AML, KYC, and anti-fraud measures will remain paramount. Crypto firms must continue to prioritize compliance. Potential for New Banking Models: This shift might encourage more traditional banks to develop specialized departments or services tailored for crypto businesses. The path forward won’t be without its challenges. Banks will need to invest in training, technology, and expertise to properly assess and manage the financial risks associated with crypto. However, the regulatory landscape is undeniably shifting towards greater acceptance and integration. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the Fed’s decision is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain. Banks will still need to overcome their own internal biases and invest in the necessary infrastructure to serve crypto clients compliantly. For crypto firms, the onus remains on demonstrating impeccable compliance and transparency. Opportunities: Growth of Crypto-Friendly Banks: We may see an increase in the number of banks willing to serve crypto businesses, potentially leading to more competitive services. Mainstream Adoption: Easier banking access could accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Regulatory Certainty: This move contributes to a broader trend of increasing regulatory clarity, which is crucial for industry growth. Challenges: Bank Reluctance: Some banks may still be hesitant due to a lack of understanding or existing risk aversion, even without the “reputational risk” clause. Compliance Costs: Implementing robust AML/KYC for crypto remains complex and potentially costly for banks. Evolving Threats: The crypto landscape is dynamic, and new financial crime risks can emerge, requiring continuous adaptation from both banks and regulators. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses and Banks For crypto firms, this is a call to double down on compliance. While a major hurdle has been removed, the expectation for robust AML/KYC frameworks remains. Banks, on the other hand, should view this as an opportunity to expand their client base and adapt to the evolving financial landscape. For Crypto Firms: Strengthen Compliance: Ensure your AML, KYC, and anti-fraud programs are top-notch and demonstrable. Educate Banks: Be prepared to educate potential banking partners about your operations and compliance measures. Seek Proactive Engagement: Reach out to banks that are showing signs of openness to the crypto sector. For Banks: Invest in Expertise: Train staff on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and associated financial crime risks. Develop Tailored Solutions: Consider creating specific banking products and services for the digital asset industry. Review Risk Frameworks: Update internal risk assessment models to align with the Fed’s new guidance, focusing on tangible financial risks. The Federal Reserve’s decision to remove “reputational risk” from its bank supervision guidelines marks a truly transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that legitimate crypto firms deserve fair access to banking services, judged on concrete financial risks rather than subjective perceptions. This move, aligning the Fed with other major U.S. regulators, paves the way for a more integrated, stable, and innovative financial ecosystem. While challenges remain, the path forward for crypto-traditional finance collaboration looks significantly brighter. This isn’t just about policy; it’s about fostering an environment where innovation can truly thrive without unnecessary barriers.

Investors who ignored Cramer’s 2023 BTC warning saw significant gains as the price rebounded. Cramer maintains crypto positions as a hedge against government financial instability. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer has been optimistic about the market in recent entries. He has been optimistic about the current oil market weakness and has drawn analogies with Ronald Reagan’s “Peace Through Strength” policy, which contributed to the end of the Soviet Union. Cramer’s remarks suggest that current market conditions are following similar patterns where economic pressure through strength positioning translates into victories. The veteran TV host’s positive mood follows his checkered history with cryptocurrency forecasts, including his very public warning on Bitcoin in 2023. Cramer told viewers to sell Bitcoin during a rally in which the cryptocurrency was trading at about $22,500. He attributed the manipulation to Sam Bankman-Fried and questioned the viability of the asset at that price.

2025-06-24T15:10:54,"Dogecoin Bounces 12% After Weekend Crash but Faces Resistance","The apex meme coin witnessed this decline over the weekend due to global macro uncertainty, fueled by escalating geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. What’s in Store for Dogecoin? Market analyst Crypto Master believes that Dogecoin is staring at a strong reversal signal, having witnessed a 25.3% drop in the past month. The analyst pointed out , “DOGE has printed a powerful bullish candle on the 4H chart after reclaiming $0.165 support. A breakout above the $0.167 resistance could ignite a new upward leg. Momentum is building up fast.” Based on this analysis, Dogecoin will have to breach major resistance at $0.167 to enhance its chances of soaring to the $0.171, $0.176, and $0.183 targets. Similar sentiments were shared by crypto analyst Tektonic that Dogecoin was gearing towards recovery if it defended a crucial support zone. Tektonic stated , “DOGE is holding firm above the $0.142–$0.16 demand zone, with bulls stepping in to defend the structure. On-chain metrics, particularly the 30-day MVRV, are signaling that a potential bottom may be in. If support holds, a price rebound could be on the horizon.” At the time of this writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1636, representing a 7.2% increase in the past 24 hours. Therefore, this shows that DOGE is inching closer to the $0.167 resistance zone, which will be pivotal in determining its next move. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase recently launched decentralized finance (DeFi) access for wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 (L2) Base network. Why a Dogecoin ETF is Deemed a Game-Changer The potential launch of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is making waves across both traditional and crypto markets. Often dubbed the “people’s crypto,” Dogecoin began as a meme but evolved into a cultural and financial phenomenon. Now, a Dogecoin ETF could mark a pivotal shift, unlocking institutional access, mainstream credibility, and massive liquidity. Mainstream Legitimacy A Dogecoin ETF would represent a crucial milestone in the coin’s journey from internet joke to legitimate financial asset. By gaining regulatory approval and listing on major stock exchanges, Dogecoin would earn recognition akin to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum—both of which saw institutional inflows soar after their respective ETF approvals. A regulated vehicle would signal to traditional investors that Dogecoin is no longer just speculative fun—it’s a viable digital asset. Increased Institutional Exposure Currently, Dogecoin’s accessibility is limited to crypto exchanges, retail wallets, and a few payment integrations. An ETF would open the floodgates to institutional capital—pension funds, asset managers, and hedge funds—many of which are restricted from directly holding crypto. This new gateway could significantly increase demand and market stability, shifting Dogecoin’s price dynamics and volatility profile. Liquidity and Volume Surge With an ETF, Dogecoin’s daily trading volume could spike, improving liquidity and reducing slippage for large trades. Greater liquidity often leads to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery, which is crucial for sophisticated investors. As we've seen with Bitcoin ETFs, increased trading volumes tend to coincide with stronger price momentum and deeper market participation. Retail Simplicity Dogecoin’s brand is heavily retail-driven, and an ETF would allow everyday investors to gain exposure through familiar brokerage platforms without handling wallets, keys, or direct crypto transactions. This simplicity could supercharge retail participation while expanding Dogecoin’s appeal to cautious newcomers. Cultural and Strategic Timing The rise of meme-driven finance and social investing trends makes the Dogecoin ETF proposal especially timely. As platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) continue to amplify community sentiment, Dogecoin’s popularity gives it an edge other altcoins lack. A Dogecoin ETF doesn’t just represent an investment product—it symbolizes the intersection of internet culture and Wall Street. Conclusion A Dogecoin ETF wouldn’t just validate the token, it could reshape the meme coin investment landscape. By bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, such a product has the potential to elevate Dogecoin from meme status to mainstream asset class. As Dogecoin stares at the major resistance zone of $0.167, it remains to be seen whether 9th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization will breach this level for sustained bullish momentum.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9689/dogecoin-bounces-12-after-weekend-crash-but-faces-resistance,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
