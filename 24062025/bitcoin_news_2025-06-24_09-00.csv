2025-06-24T06:48:14,"$4B Hong Kong Family Office Enters Crypto — How Big is the Bet?","VMS Group, a Hong Kong multifamily offices with deep roots in private equity, is making its first push into digital assets as clearer regulations and institutional momentum pull traditional investors into the crypto space. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the firm, which manages nearly $4b for some of the city’s wealthiest families, plans to allocate up to $10m to Re7 Capital, a London-based hedge fund focused on decentralized finance strategies. VMS managing partner Elton Cheung said the move reflects a shift in how the firm approaches liquidity and diversification. Founded two decades ago, the Hong Kong firm has historically focused on private equity and long-term bets across sectors such as property, pharmaceuticals and technology. But with companies staying private longer and exits becoming harder to time, the firm is now leaning into more liquid strategies, including digital assets. VMS Chooses Hedged Approach to Crypto Over Direct Token Holdings “We thought this was the right time because of growing demand and because we see clearer legislative and government support from various jurisdictions, as well as large institutional support and endorsement,” Cheung told Bloomberg. He did not disclose specific clients. Instead of buying volatile tokens like Bitcoin , VMS chose to work with Re7, which offers a market-neutral strategy. The fund earns yield by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges and lending stablecoins, while hedging to reduce price swings. That approach aligns more closely with the risk frameworks of legacy family offices that are seeking exposure without speculative downside. “The reason investors keep coming back to crypto is the asymmetry of risk and return,” said Re7 founder Evgeny Gokhberg. “Typically, people think about asymmetry in crypto as ‘lose it all or make a 100x.’ That’s rarely a fit for a serious allocator with a reputation to lose.” Re7, founded in 2021, claims to have consistently delivered double-digit returns, though it did not disclose exact figures. Next-Gen Wealth Influences Hong Kong Family Office’s Shift Toward Broader Digital Asset Adoption VMS’ crypto strategy goes beyond hedge fund exposure. Zhi Li, who joined the firm in December to lead digital asset investments from London, said the team is studying broader applications, including blockchain payments and infrastructure. One current area of interest is integrating crypto-based transactions at a real estate development the firm operates in Vietnam. “There is very strong institutional and family interest in getting regulated digital asset exposure,” said Li. “We have seen the younger generation of families wanting to do something different.” As family offices evolve to serve new wealth dynamics and generational preferences, VMS’s entry into crypto reflects a broader shift. Once reluctant, legacy capital is now stepping into digital assets, not for hype, but for structure, yield and strategic positioning.

2025-06-24T06:46:49,"Israeli man arrested for acting as an Iranian spy in exchange for cryptocurrency","A 27-year old Tel Aviv resident was recently arrested by police for allegedly spying on Israeli public officials for Iran. He was reportedly paid thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for his efforts. According to a recent news reports by i24 and Arutz Sheva, Israeli authorities claimed that the suspect, a man named Or Beilin, was paid thousands of dollars in crypto to conduct espionage on Israeli public officials and political activities. Following his handler’s instructions, the Israeli man was assigned to spy on public officials by taking photographs of their homes in secret, documenting government military installations and report on political spray-painted graffiti. The 27-year-old was arrested on June 24 by the Israeli police and the Shin Bet security service. The police raided his home and seized the culprit’s computer and other digital equipment used to receive crypto payments and communicate with Iranian contacts. He has been temporarily detained under suspicion as authorities continue to carry out more investigations into the matter. According to the report , the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court has extended his detention until June 26 as the investigation continues.

The police urged residents to report any suspicious recruitment from foreign actors. Most recently, the police have arrested two other Israeli citizens were also arrested for similar espionage activities. One of them is 28-year-old Dmitri Cohen, who is accused of gathering intelligence on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son’s fiancée.

2025-06-24T06:44:54,"Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Right Now For 2x Profits Soon","The post Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Right Now For 2x Profits Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As tensions escalate between the U.S. and Iran, triggered by missile strikes and rising geopolitical repurcussions, the global market’s reaction might surprise you. Despite alarming headlines, equities like the S&P and NASDAQ are climbing, oil prices are falling, and crypto sentiment is far from collapsing. Moreover, President Trump’s peace-leaning X post has added calm to the chaos. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst VirtualBacon offers a refreshing perspective: “This is not a time to sell in fear, but a time to buy with conviction”. Intriguing enough? let’s dive into the analysis for more details. Bitcoin Holds Steady in Bullish Territory? The analyst highlights that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish above $85k, supported by its 50-week SMA. With the ideal entry between $94k and $95k, aligned with the 20-week SMA, he believes that the market weakness here is viewed as a gift, not a threat. A potential double-top pattern is forming, and if the neckline breaks, it could deliver the long-awaited entry point. It is worth noting that the on-chain metrics show neutral sentiment, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 47, indicating indecision rather than panic. With BTC dominance at 64.5%, the flagship crypto continues to command the broader market. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Must Buy Altcoins During the Dip Ethereum recently touched $2,100, precisely where the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement lands. With ETH/BTC holding firm above 0.018, Ethereum remains in a macro uptrend. Analyst suggest this is a favorable range to begin scaling in, especially if the BTC price remains above $90k. Successively, Solana is slightly weaker, but its $110–$120 zone is widely regarded as a value area. He mentions that, the failed inverse head & shoulders pattern doesn’t invalidate the setup unless SOL/BTC collapses. Meanwhile, XRP is nearing its prime entry zone between $1.74–$1.80. However, caution remains as traders await confirmation of a potential 3x move. Also read our Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! VirtualBacon highlights that TAO, a leader in the AI sector, is resilient. If BTC dips to $95k, TAO may offer a $200 entry opportunity with a $175 stop-loss. Meme coin PEPE is retesting its neckline at $0.009 after holding 15-month support at $0.005. With clean structure and growing volume, it remains a top pick among high-risk traders. FAQs Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Yes, $94k–$95k is seen as a strong re-entry zone if the short-term pattern confirms. Which altcoins look most attractive now? Ethereum and Solana show favorable technicals, with ETH holding macro strength. What’s the market mood right now? Neutral. The Fear & Greed Index is 47, and despite war headlines, crypto cap is up 4.26%.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-5-altcoins-to-buy-right-now-for-2x-profits-soon/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T06:30:36,"Historic Ripple Image Suggests XRP is the “Final Product” of Bitcoin Beta Test","Crypto influencer Amelie posted a tweet drawing attention to an old promotional image of Ripple from its early development phase. The tweet, captioned “WOW! ‘RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.’ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT. HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH,” was accompanied by a photo of an early Ripple conference booth. In the image, a banner describes Ripple as “the world’s first open payment network” and highlights features such as distributed exchanges, cross-currency payments, and liquidity improvements. One of the key takeaways from the banner is the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners,” which Amelie used as a central element in her statement. The image likely dates back to Ripple’s earliest promotional stages, when the team was presenting its vision to the broader blockchain and developer community. It prominently features Arthur Britto and David Schwartz’s early positioning of Ripple as a technologically advanced alternative to Bitcoin’s initial shortcomings in payment scalability and interoperability. WOW! „RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.“ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH. pic.twitter.com/JH44HBzUhI — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 22, 2025 Context Behind “Built by Bitcoiners” Amelie’s use of the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners” points to the historical reality that some of Ripple’s early contributors had been involved in Bitcoin or had studied its limitations closely. Ripple’s creators sought to improve on what they considered inefficiencies in Bitcoin’s architecture, especially around transaction throughput, energy consumption, and lack of native support for multiple currencies. Ripple’s consensus protocol, which differs significantly from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work model , was introduced to address these issues directly. The tweet suggests that Bitcoin functioned as a “beta test,” while XRP represents a more refined, scalable iteration. This perspective is controversial, but Amelie presents it as a factual progression rather than a speculative opinion. The tone of her message is definitive, asserting XRP’s role as the superior technological evolution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions to the Tweet Amelie’s tweet received responses from other users on the X platform. One user, posting under the handle Crypto, reacted with a rhetorical question: “Is the failure worth 100,000 dollars? Ha ha ha,” seemingly mocking Bitcoin’s high valuation in the context of its limitations. Another user named James echoed Amelie’s position, stating , “I agree XRP is the better vision of Bitcoin.” These replies reflect contrasting interpretations of Bitcoin’s value proposition relative to XRP’s utility and network design. Significance of the Image in the Broader XRP Narrative The promotional image shared in Amelie’s tweet serves as a reminder of Ripple’s original messaging strategy and technological goals. Descriptions on the banner, such as “More Merchants,” “Increased Liquidity & Utility,” and “Shared Principles, Shared Dream” reflect the ambition to build a more adaptable and enterprise-friendly system than Bitcoin. The visual reinforcement of Ripple’s origins and ethos, alongside Amelie’s labeling of Bitcoin as a prototype, adds context to the longstanding debate about which blockchain projects are best suited for institutional and cross-border applications . The image and accompanying statement also illustrate how the early Ripple team sought legitimacy by building on Bitcoin’s foundation while simultaneously identifying areas for improvement.

2025-06-24T06:30:18,"Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins?","The post Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising after the conflict between Iran & Israel approached a ceasefire situation. Bitcoin price surged from the lows below $100K and marked a daily high above $106K, which elevated the market capitalization above $3.24 trillion. With this, the market sentiments also surged from fear to neutral, signaling the growing confidence among the market participants. Top Cryptos Recover After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement As the war situation escalated, Bitcoin and the other cryptos faced a huge sell-off with the uncertainty hovering over the markets. The global financial markets also faced the heat, but soon after US President Trump announced a ceasefire between the nations, the markets recovered. In a blog post on Truth Social, Trump announced that Iran and Israel have agreed to a full ceasefire, potentially ending the ‘12-day war. With this, top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and a few more rebounded, while several other categories also reacted positively. Meanwhile, the top gainers included SEI, which surged by more than 30% with a huge rise in volume of over 180%. On the other hand, the memecoins attracted double-digit gains; SPX6900 surged by over 30%, followed by Mog Coin by over 26%, Brett by over 20%, and dogwifhat by over 22%. Meanwhile, the top memecoins, Dogecoin & Shiba Inu, are also preparing for a strong rebound that may elevate the levels within the bullish pattern. AI, RWA & DePIN Space Also Thrive The AI space has gained immense attention in recent times, with the tokens outperforming the top cadre tokens. However, the trader’s interest focused back on the top tokens, which kept the AI tokens under tight consolidation. Bittensor price surged by over 16%, followed by Render by over 15% and Livepeer & Theta Network by over 12% each. On the other hand, the crypto ETFs also saw a positive netflow, as the institutions accumulated over $327 million worth of BTC and over $100.7 million worth of Ethereum. Meanwhile, the Open interest continues to descend, suggesting the traders are opting out of their positions, which does not support the bullish narrative. Will the Crypto Market Continue to Rise? The crypto market has experienced notable relief driven by external factors; however, the significant sell-off was also caused by a similar factor. This suggests the markets have risen above the pure demand and supply tactics and have a huge influence on the goings-on in the outside world. Hence, any further escalation or any announcement may increase the uncertainty, which may further result in a fresh breakdown. Hence, the market participants are expected to remain highly vigilant about the upcoming price action.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-why-the-crypto-market-is-up-today-is-this-a-bullish-signal-for-bitcoin-other-altcoins/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MOG","Price Analysis|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T06:26:44,"Democrats unveil COIN Act to block Trump and public officials from profiting off crypto","Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation that seeks to block U.S. public officials, including the President, from profiting off digital assets during and after their time in office. Dubbed the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure, or COIN, Act, the legislation came in response to concerns over President Donald Trump’s financial ties to cryptocurrency ventures. The bill was introduced by Senator Adam Schiff and co-sponsored by nine other Democratic lawmakers, following reports that Trump earned $57.4 million in 2024 through World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform linked to his family. Schiff said the president’s digital asset activities have raised serious ethical and constitutional concerns, pointing to what he described as Trump’s use of public office for personal financial gain. The COIN Act has been tailored to prevent what its sponsors call the “financial exploitation of digital assets” by elected officials and their immediate families. According to the text of the COIN Act, the legislation would prohibit current and former public officials, including the president, vice president, members of Congress, and high-ranking executive officials, from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets such as meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. This restriction would apply for 180 days prior to taking office and continue for two years after leaving office. Immediate family members would also be subject to the same rules. Further, the bill would amend the Ethics in Government Act to require digital assets to be included in financial disclosures and transaction reports. It also proposes codifying that holding or trading crypto qualifies as a financial interest under conflict of interest laws, requiring officials to recuse themselves from related decisions. Additionally, the legislation would require stablecoin issuers to certify quarterly that no public official is profiting from the issuance of their tokens in order to receive regulatory approval. You might also like: Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire A separate provision calls for the Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress within 360 days, offering recommendations on how to update federal ethics laws as crypto oversight frameworks develop. Pressure to introduce such guardrails has been building for months, driven largely by Democratic lawmakers alarmed by Trump’s expanding crypto portfolio. Earlier this year, Rep. Maxine Waters accused Trump of using his memecoin, $TRUMP, to enrich himself while defrauding investors. In April, Waters raised alarms over World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, warning that the token could become a tool for foreign actors to channel funds to the president. She has also condemned Trump’s private gala for top $TRUMP memecoin holders, calling it a “pay-to-play scheme” that blurred the line between campaign fundraising and political favour-trading. These concerns have already translated into multiple Democratic-led legislative efforts. Waters and other lawmakers have backed bills such as the MEME Act , led by Rep. Sam Liccardo, and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, both aimed at barring public officials and their families from owning or promoting digital assets while in office. Despite repeated objections, Trump has continued to expand his footprint in the digital asset sector. His family has backed multiple crypto ventures, including stablecoins and a reported stake in a Bitcoin mining project. Blockchain data has linked prominent crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , to large holdings of Trump-affiliated tokens.

According to a June 24 disclosure , the Tokyo-based firm said the new funding will accelerate the next phase of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) acquisition campaign, including the implementation of its “555 Million Plan” revealed earlier this month. The funds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, supporting Metaplanet’s goal of acquiring 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, or 1% of the capped supply. Metaplanet Treasury Corp, established in Florida in May 2025, serves as the company’s operational hub for U.S.-based treasury activity. The firm claims that the U.S. market’s institutional infrastructure, deep liquidity, and transparent regulations make it an excellent place to execute. Miami in particular was picked due to its pro-Bitcoin stance and growing reputation as a digital asset hub. This $5 billion capital contribution is expected to be funded through the exercise of newly issued stock acquisition rights. While Metaplanet emphasized there would be no change to the previously disclosed use of proceeds, it noted that any material financial impact would be disclosed in due course.

It is now the eighth-largest holder globally, surpassing firms such as Coinbase and Hut 8. So far this year, Metaplanet’s stock has increased by more than 300%. Analysts have, however, noted that there is an increasing premium built into the price of its shares. Some estimates place the price of Bitcoin at between $596,000 and $759,000 per coin, which is significantly higher than current market rates. This premium raises questions regarding sustainability and dilution risk, but it also reflects investors’ desire for indirect Bitcoin exposure through equity markets.

2025-06-24T06:11:24,"Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits","The post Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a bold move to separate politics from digital profits, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill, the COIN Act, that would stop the President, Vice President, and their immediate families from making money through crypto while holding office. And yes, this seems to take aim straight at Donald Trump’s growing crypto ventures . What Is the COIN Act? Officially called the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, the bill proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or promoting any kind of digital asset. This includes meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins, which have become popular ways for public figures to build wealth. Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 If passed, it would prevent not only the president and vice president, but also members of Congress and senior executive officials from endorsing or sponsoring any kind of digital asset project. Why Now? Schiff Points to Trump’s Crypto Profits This legislation is a direct response to Donald Trump’s growing presence in the crypto market. In 2024 alone, Trump reportedly earned over $57 million from token sales and crypto-related ventures. He’s also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs — all of which raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schiff argues that allowing presidents to profit from these markets while in office could blur ethical lines and compromise decision-making. What the Bill Would Do The COIN Act would cover not just the president but also senior executive officials and members of Congress, including their immediate families. Key features include: A ban on creating or promoting crypto assets Mandatory disclosure for digital asset sales over $1,000 Penalties for violations: profits forfeited and up to 5 years in prison .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement , Schiff’s Change of Heart? Interestingly, Schiff supported the GENIUS Act just last week—a bill aimed at setting rules for stablecoins but which left out restrictions for presidents and vice presidents. Now, Schiff seems to be correcting that omission with the COIN Act. So far, nine Senate Democrats have backed the bill. Trump’s Crypto Rise Continues Despite the political pushback, Trump’s crypto activity shows no signs of slowing. He’s involved in everything from Bitcoin mining to launching memecoins and ETFs. His company, TMTG, recently gained SEC approval tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. With 2025 shaping up to be even bigger for crypto and politics, Schiff’s COIN Act could become a major turning point—if it can pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Answers","The Norwegian government is preparing to take a new step towards cryptocurrency mining facilities, which are notable for their high energy consumption. Norway’s Labor government plans to temporarily ban the construction of new crypto mining data centers that use energy-intensive “proof-of-work” systems, according to Reuters. Proof-of-work systems are a key part of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, and are used to secure the network. If approved, the ban is expected to come into effect in the fall of 2025. The government's main goal is to preserve the country's electricity capacity for more efficient and productive sectors. “Cryptocurrency mining consumes a lot of energy and contributes little in terms of employment or income to local communities,” Norwegian Minister of Digitalization Karianne Tung said in a statement. Tung also noted that this move is a clear indication of the government’s intention to limit cryptocurrency mining in Norway as much as possible. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Announces Both an Airdrop and Listing Norway has long been a favorite of bitcoin miners looking for low-cost, clean energy thanks to its abundant renewable hydropower. Companies like Kryptovault, near Oslo, operate data centers that consume up to 40 MW of power and recycle the heat to dry wood or heat buildings. But despite the renewable energy infrastructure, the need for continuous and high-capacity energy from these mining facilities is increasingly considered by regulators as a waste of resources that should be directed to more efficient areas such as industry, heating or artificial intelligence data processing. However, Norway only has a proportional impact of 0.74% in terms of hashrate, the measure of Bitcoin mining, and is ranked as the 11th most mined country. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T06:00:03,"This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market’s Next True ‘Pivot,’ Says Glassnode","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted the $97,000 to $98,000 zone as an important one for Bitcoin. Here’s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss When the mood in the market is bullish, holders can react to retests of their cost basis from above by buying more. They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a ‘dip.’ The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency’s supply is concentrated, it doesn’t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode’s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices. Finally, there are the Loss Sellers (red) and Profit Takers (yellow), who correspond to investors exiting at a loss and profit, respectively. During the past couple of weeks, the former cohort has seen an increase of 29%, a sign that weak hands have been capitulating. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy That said, the analytics firm has noted, “Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses – others are actively lowering their cost basis.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,900, down more than 4% in the last seven days.

2025-06-24T06:00:02,"Ethereum Sees Slight Drop But Whales Show No Signs Of Selling – Details","Ethereum (ETH) has dropped 13.6% over the past week, largely due to rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran. Despite this recent price slump, Ethereum whales appear undeterred, signalling confidence in the digital asset’s long-term recovery. Ethereum Whales Are Not Budged Despite Recent Loss According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by technical trader Mignolet, ETH whales are unfazed by the recent price pullback in the cryptocurrency. Notably, the digital asset has tumbled from $2,869 on June 11 to the mid $2,200 range at the time of writing. Unlike the double-top pattern observed in 2021 – when Ethereum saw a notable increase in transaction outflows as whales exited near the top – current data suggests that whales are not making similar moves. The analyst shared the following comparative chart showing that in previous market cycles, spikes in ETH withdrawals from wallets were typically followed by major price pullbacks. However, such spikes are currently absent, suggesting low exit activity. In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Ted Pillows added further support to this view, stating that Ethereum whales are actually buying the dip. According to the analyst, wallets holding 10,000 ETH or more collectively added over $265 million worth of ETH during the market pullback on June 21. Nevertheless, Pillows warned that if ETH fails to break above the $2,350 resistance level soon, it may revisit the $2,100 support. A failure to hold this level could expose the asset to a further decline toward $1,800. On the other hand, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader offered a more optimistic take. The analyst compared Ethereum’s current price behavior to the accumulation phase seen between 2019 and 2021, stating that “ETH to five-figures isn’t a dream,” implying a long-term bullish outlook remains intact. Headwinds Brewing For ETH? Although technical indicators point toward further upside for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, some market experts opine that ETH may be on the verge of entering a period of downtrend before it resumes its bullish trajectory. For example, seasoned crypto market expert Aksel Kibar recently remarked that ETH may be preparing for a period of significant downtrend movement. The analyst gave a stark warning of ETH possibly falling all the way down to $900. Similarly, rising sell-volume for ETH threatens to further disrupt the digital asset’s positive price momentum. At press time, ETH trades at $2,233, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sees-slight-drop-but-whales-show-no-signs-of-selling-details/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Whales|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T06:00:02,"Bitcoin Could Spike to $120K, Here Are 4 Factors Boosting the Case for a BTC Bull Run","Multiple analysts have repeatedly pointed to $120,000 as bitcoin's BTC price target this year. Recent developments have strengthened that bullish case, driven by four key factors: the spot price, central bank policy, energy market trend, and technical setup. Let's take a look at those in detail. BTC's love affair with $100K Recently, a crypto trader said that the best marketing for any asset is its price, highlighting an idea which is similar to legendary trader George Soros' theory of reflexivity. Soros explained that market perceptions and prices create a feedback loop – higher prices attract more buyers, which in turn drive prices higher, often far beyond what fundamentals suggest. In this context, bitcoin's resilience, marked by prices holding largely above $100,000 through the Iran-Israel conflict and the U.S. airstrike on Iran, is its strongest appeal. The steadfastness indicates underlying strength, which could reassure holders while attracting new buyers, potentially fueling the next leg higher in prices. Moreover, brief dips below $100,000 seen in the past 48 hours saw investors step in with bids, revealing the ""buy the dip mentality."" ""We are seeing exchange outflows, so it is likely that people, regardless of being retail or institutions, are buying the dip. Generally, when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tend to be heavy short-term dips, which later rebound depending on the severity and how the situation is communicated. So far, I'd say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here,"" Nicolai Soendergaard, research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an email Monday. Meanwhile, data tracked by Glassnode shows weak hands began selling on June 10, while conviction buyers resorted to bargain hunting. ""Since June 10, BTC investors classified as Loss Sellers rose 29% (from $74K to $95.6K), showing growing pressure on weak hands. But Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses - others are actively lowering their cost basis,"" Glassnode said on X. Trump seems to have found his doves Liquidity easing, represented by Fed rate cuts and other measures, typically bodes well for stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some Fed officials are warming up to the idea of a potential rate cut in July, which contradicts Chairman Jerome Powell's data-dependent stance. ""Trump seems to have found his doves,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst and Managing Editor, Adam Button wrote on Monda y after Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, a hawk, said the central bank should cut rates in July. Hawks are those who prefer tighter monetary policy and higher rates to temper inflation. Doves are policymakers preferring lower rates to support growth. Bowman said that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer and could be smaller than initially expected, adding that she would support lowering the interest rate next month, assuming inflation pressures remain contained. Fed Governor Christopher Waller voiced a similar opinion Friday, favoring a rate cut in July. ""Now, maybe it's just a coincidence that two former hawks who are also Republicans are suddenly doves, but it's starting to look like a MAGA takeover of the Fed. And if there's one thing [President Donald] Trump has been consistent about through his entire career (and it might only be one single thing), it's that he likes low interest rates,"" Button wrote. Chairman Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony to the U.S. Congress is due on Tuesday. Powell is likely to reiterate the Fed's independence and data-dependent stance while potentially being grilled by Republicans for keeping rates elevated. Oil slide Never before has the crowd been so wrong on crude oil. On Sunday, the consensus was that the U.S. military strikes on Iran and Tehran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz would send oil prices skywards. But on Monday, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic crashed. The slide is good news for central banks fearing the second-order effects of the oil price spike seen late last week, and those expecting rate cuts. The second-order effects typically include increased transportation expenses, higher prices for goods reliant on oil-derived products, and potential wages, all leading to an overall increase in inflation. ""So much for the fear of second order effects of Oil that Central Bankers proclaim. Crude oil down 6.5% on the day and 15.41% YoY..that’s deflation,"" James E. Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington Atlus, said on X . Bullish technical setup Momentum indicators – key moving averages – are once again aligned bullishly. The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) has just crossed above the 200-day SMA, weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs produced a bullish golden crossover. The result is that the three widely-tracked averages are stacked one above the other in a classic upward-sloping bullish momentum formation.

The company has raised $750 million “from some of the leading institutional investors on Wall Street,” Pompliano posted on X. “The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq,” said Pompliano through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. “As part of the business combination, I have raised over $750 million, which is the largest initial fundraise in history for a publicly-traded bitcoin treasury company.” Today I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial services. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC, LLC and Columbus Circle… — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) June 23, 2025 ProCap to Acquire Bitcoin – BTC Treasury Firms Are on The Rise Pompliano stated that ProCap will strategically acquire Bitcoin and generate revenue and profits from its BTC holdings. Per the official announcement , ProCap Financial will hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It will offer services including trading, lending and capital markets, all denominated in Bitcoin. Further, the $750 million funding includes $235 million in convertible debt, with the remaining amount comprising equity. “It is time to get to work,” said podcast host Pompliano. In a reply to Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, he said, “Your idea is spreading globally as people realize the value of Bitcoin.” Indeed, inspired by Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which currently holds 592,345, after adding 245 Bitcoins on Monday , several public companies are turning into Bitcoin proxies. Intersection of Bitcoin and Traditional Finance However, according to Pompliano, ProCap is pushing beyond that model. He said that the company would build a financial services platform on top of it, besides accumulating Bitcoin. “Our objective is to develop a platform that will not only acquire bitcoin for our balance sheet, but will also implement risk-mitigated solutions to generate revenue and profits from our bitcoin holdings,” he said. Additionally, equity investors will have immediate exposure from day one, the announcement added. “ProCap Financial aims to become the leading financial services firm at the intersection of bitcoin and traditional finance.” Pompliano told CNBC that the goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution, which resonates very differently with capital allocators.

The asset cooled a little, falling back to just over $105,000 at the time of writing. It has now recovered all losses over the past few days and returned to its range-bound channel. BTC fell below six figures for the first time since early May on Monday following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. However, it did not stay below $100,000 for very long. S&P 500 futures also rose marginally late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said that now the sounds of World War III are fading, “macroeconomic tables should be shifting.” The dollar will continue falling, the Renminbi will break out, gold consolidates, and rates are going to fall.

Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, BTC surged past $106,000, reversing Sunday’s dip below $98,500, the lowest in over a month. Crypto Market Rebound on Ceasefire and Fed Bets The sudden recovery wasn’t just about peace talks. Traders are now betting on U.S. interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool showing a 53% chance that rates could fall to 3.75% or lower by November. That’s good news for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on looser monetary policy. Despite the recent $193 million in long liquidations, Bitcoin’s open interest remains robust at $68 billion. This signals continued institutional interest, even in the face of macro turbulence. Bitcoin Hashrate Dips 8%, But Analysts Stay Calm No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy. Firstly, drops like this are common (see chart below) and are more likely due to ERCOT curtailment (being paid to shed load, or getting a price signal it's uneconomical to mine).… https://t.co/AxX3poncZ6 pic.twitter.com/XnL4YGaMCl — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 23, 2025 Bitcoin’s hashrate fell by 8% last week, prompting concerns over mining disruptions, particularly in regions like Iran, where unofficial mining is rumored to consume up to 2GW of electricity. However, analysts like Daniel Batten see no reason to panic. Similar drops occurred during U.S. weather events, like the April storms that slashed hashrate by 27%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street , Crypto investment funds posted $1.24 billion in inflows last week, the tenth straight week of gains.

Short-Bitcoin products saw $1.4 million in outflows, underlining a bullish tilt. Trump Media Fuels Bullish Sentiment Adding more fuel to the fire, Trump Media just greenlit a $400 million stock buyback while filing to launch a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF under the Truth Social brand. The proposed ETF would allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, pending SEC approval. Combined with its $2.3 billion in fresh capital and crypto ambitions, the company’s moves are adding to the overall bullish tone in the market. Bitcoin Price : $110K in Sight? With institutional flows strong, geopolitical fears easing, and Trump’s ETF push catching eyes, the road to $110,000 might not be far off. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next move.

Moreover, this rebound has sparked fresh momentum across the altcoin market too, lifting coins like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Polkadot, and even Pi Network.

The Crypto market reacted sharply to the news of military operations against Iran’s nuclear sites. Bitcoin dropped below $103,000, and major altcoins fell over 9% in 24 hours. The sell-off was mainly due to increased risk aversion, fears of rising oil prices, and concerns that inflation might prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates. Liquidations surged by 38%, exceeding $682 million. Is this a good buying opportunity, or should I wait for more stability? Some users see this as a buying opportunity, especially for those who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. One commenter noted that Bitcoin often drops during geopolitical tensions but tends to bounce back harder than traditional markets. However, others warn that volatility could continue if tensions escalate, so caution is advise What are people doing with their crypto during the crisis? Some are moving funds into cold storage or shifting from high-risk altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are seen as more resilient. Others are taking profits or waiting for further dips before re-entering the market. Will the market recover quickly now that there’s a ceasefire? Sentiment is turning positive after the ceasefire announcement. Bitcoin rebounded above $106,000, and Ethereum surged 9%. Many expect further recovery, especially with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and continued institutional inflows.

2025-06-24T05:35:10,"Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire","The cryptocurrency market rallied on Tuesday, June 24, following news of a potential truce between Israel and Iran, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. According to a June 24 report by Reuters, Trump said both countries had agreed to end hostilities after a 12-day conflict, though Israel has yet to confirm the agreement, and missiles were reportedly launched from Iran early Tuesday. Markets reacted swiftly. After suffering losses over the weekend due to concerns about a wider conflict in the Middle East, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased 2.4% to $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed 3.7% to $105,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) surged 7% to $2,396. Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) also posted strong gains of 7% and 6%, respectively. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 18 points to 65, marking a return to “Greed” territory. Other market indicators suggest improving sentiment. Data from Coinglass shows the average relative strength index across the market rose to 58, a neutral level. Open interest rose by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped to $481 million, down 24% from the previous day. You might also like: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness Markets had turned lower just two days earlier when U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites sparked fears of prolonged conflict and economic disruption. Bitcoin fell nearly 4% to $98,615 at the time, with Ethereum and Solana dropping up to 10%. The attack also led to nearly $1 billion in crypto long- liquidations and a $40 billion loss in total market capitalization. Traders now appear cautiously optimistic. Trump claimed the ceasefire was brokered in coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and mediated through Qatari and U.S. diplomatic channels. While Iranian officials suggested a willingness to pause attacks if Israel halted further aggression, they stopped short of a full commitment. In traditional markets, the ceasefire news also boosted sentiment. After-hours trading saw a 0.4% increase in S&P 500 futures, while oil prices fell from recent highs as concerns about disruptions to Gulf shipping routes subsided. Crypto markets seem to be pricing in a de-escalation for the time being, but traders are still on the lookout for any new developments. The rally might depend on whether the ceasefire holds in the days ahead, as geopolitical risk is still high and neither party has officially confirmed a ceasefire.

2025-06-24T05:33:37,"Sequans Joins Corporate Bitcoin Rush With $384M Funding Plan","After partnering with Swan Bitcoin for treasury management, Sequans now aligns itself with firms like Metaplanet and Nakamoto Holdings, which have aggressively increased their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet bought another 1,111 BTC this week, boosting its total to 11,111 and bringing it within reach of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The corporate Bitcoin adoption trend is gaining global momentum, with firms in Norway, France, and South Korea also jumping in. Meanwhile, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, has dubbed this trend “the new alt season,” and encouraged speculators to shift funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of Bitcoin-holding companies. He believes this wave is a precursor to hyperbitcoinization and a potential $200 trillion Bitcoin market. Despite criticisms from traditional firms like Meta and Microsoft, the enthusiasm surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasuries suggests that there is a transformative shift in how companies view asset diversification and long-term value preservation. Sequans Pushes Into Bitcoin Sequans Communications announced a bold move to raise $384 million to establish a strategic Bitcoin treasury, joining a growing wave of companies betting on Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The IoT semiconductor and module developer plans to raise approximately $195 million through an equity issuance and $189 million via convertible debentures, which could later be converted into company shares. To support this initiative, Sequans is partnering with Swan Bitcoin, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin treasury management. Announcement from Sequans The company's CEO, Georges Karam, explained the long-term investment thesis behind the decision, and called Bitcoin a ”premier asset.” This aligns Sequans with the rising trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasuries with Bitcoin holdings. Just in the past few days, firms like Nakamoto Holdings and Metaplanet expanded their Bitcoin reserves. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that over 240 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, which is almost double from several weeks ago. Collectively, these firms control roughly 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) However, the strategy is not without its critics. Major corporations like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft steered clear of Bitcoin treasury allocations, due to its notorious volatility and the still changing regulatory landscape. For these firms, preserving capital is a priority, and the risk profile of Bitcoin doesn't align with more traditional treasury management objectives. Despite these concerns, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is still a benchmark in the corporate Bitcoin landscape. With a stash of 592,345 BTC valued at over $60 billion, the company continues to lead in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, often leveraging convertible debt to fund its acquisitions. Now that Sequans joined the ranks of Bitcoin-holding companies, the trend of corporate adoption could reshape how institutions approach treasury diversification. Metaplanet Buys 1,111 More BTC Metaplanet, which is Japan’s leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, also announced on Monday that it bought an additional 1,111 BTC , pushing its total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. The acquisition was shared in a regulatory filing , and puts the company within close range of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The latest purchase cost the company approximately 17.26 billion Japanese yen, or about $117 million, with an average purchase price just below $105,500 per coin. Although Bitcoin was trading slightly lower at just under $102,000 at the time of the announcement, Metaplanet’s overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin, keeping the firm well-positioned even in the face of short-term market fluctuations. This move happened after Metaplanet’s previous acquisition of 1,112 BTC just one week earlier, which brought its holdings to 10,000 BTC and cemented its place as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. After briefly slipping to ninth due to an increase in holdings by mining company Hut 8, Metaplanet now regained its eighth-place standing . Top 10 largest Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Tesla is the next target in the rankings, with only 398 more BTC than Metaplanet. This gap could be closed in the coming weeks given the company’s recent momentum. Above Tesla, the next holder is CleanSpark, with 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation is also part of the broader trend among public companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Parataxis Holdings also entered the space with the launch of a Bitcoin-native treasury platform aimed at the South Korean public market. In Norway, K33 recently announced plans to raise approximately $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Block Exchange saw its stock price soar by more than 138% after declaring its intent to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. France-based The Blockchain Group also joined the movement by acquiring 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. As more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the trend appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum. Bitcoin Treasuries Are the New Alt Season Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and inventor of Hashcash, believes the growing trend of public companies adopting Bitcoin treasuries has become the new altcoin season for speculators. On Monday, he stated that “Bitcoin treasury season is the new ALT SZN,” and encouraged investors to move funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of companies accumulating Bitcoin. According to Back, firms are acquiring BTC aggressively, often through methods like convertible note offerings, to increase their Bitcoin per share. This is a strategy that is drawing the attention of market participants looking for stronger exposure to Bitcoin. His comments come during a huge wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with the number of public companies holding BTC doubling since June 5. Back sees this trend as a precursor to “hyperbitcoinization,” a scenario where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global financial system. He previously suggested this shift could turn Bitcoin into a $200 trillion market opportunity, led by treasury-heavy institutions and early government adopters. While the trend is accelerating, it also introduces some risks. For example, Metaplanet saw its Bitcoin premium soar to over $596,000 in late May, indicating that shareholders were paying more than five times the market value of Bitcoin through its stock. This raised questions about the speculative overvaluation of such companies. Nonetheless, Back firmly believes that Bitcoin-focused firms may provide a way out for investors who have suffered losses in altcoins. In a response on X , he suggested that switching to Bitcoin via treasury companies could help these investors recoup some of their altcoin-related losses. Even though altcoins have struggled to gain momentum, some are also seeing institutional traction. Interactive Strength , a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment company, disclosed its intent to raise $500 million to start a token treasury centered on Fetch.ai. This means that the concept of crypto treasuries is expanding beyond just Bitcoin.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9674/sequans-joins-corporate-bitcoin-rush-with-384-m-funding-plan,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T05:26:01,"Dogecoin Surges 7% as Bulls Break Key Resistance","Dogecoin surged 6.56% over the past 24 hours, bouncing from a two-month low of $0.1508 to a session high of $0.1632, as traders stepped in aggressively following a technical breakout. The move came amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which triggered broad volatility across crypto markets but failed to derail DOGE’s momentum. The meme coin broke through a long-standing descending trendline, confirming a shift in short-term market structure. Hourly RSI readings recovered from oversold territory, while netflows turned neutral, suggesting that sell-side exhaustion may have run its course. News Background Global markets have been rattled by renewed military activity in the Middle East, with U.S. airstrikes in Iran over the weekend raising risk-off sentiment. Despite the wider crypto selloff, Dogecoin showed relative strength, recovering faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum and pushing past key resistance levels. Technical analysts note that the rally was driven by a sharp increase in trading activity, particularly during the 22:00 UTC hour, when volume surged past 800 million units and price spiked 3.77% in under 60 minutes. The breakout has sparked renewed discussion about a potential retest of the $0.17–$0.18 range if volume remains elevated and global risk sentiment stabilizes. Dogecoin’s network fundamentals also remain intact, with transaction volume and active wallet counts trending higher over the past week. While macro conditions remain fragile, the memecoin’s resilience is capturing renewed attention from traders betting on short-term altcoin rotation. Price Action Dogecoin traded in a broad range from $0.1508 to $0.1632 over the session, ultimately settling around $0.1615. The $0.150 zone acted as a springboard after the asset reached a local bottom following weeks of declining momentum. A clean break above $0.162 resistance has now established a short-term higher high, with $0.165 emerging as the next level to watch. The final hour of the session saw minor consolidation, with DOGE pulling back slightly from intraday highs and forming a potential bull flag above $0.161. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE posted a 6.56% gain, rising from $0.153 to $0.1632 over 24 hours • Price broke above a descending trendline, confirming bullish breakout • Key support formed at $0.150 after a two-month low, with volume over 800M during rebound • $0.165 now acts as short-term resistance; $0.162 holding as support • RSI has exited oversold conditions; MACD signals a potential continuation • Final-hour pullback remains shallow, indicating healthy consolidation",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/dogecoin-surges-7-as-bulls-break-key-resistance,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|AI Market Insights|Dogecoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T05:15:49,"Ether, Solana, Cardano Spike 7% as Trump Claims to Broker Israel-Iran Ceasefire","A fragile calm swept across risk assets on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, sparking a rally in crypto majors. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump said on his Truth Social account. Ether ETH, Solana's SOL SOL, and Cardano's ADA ADA surged around 7% in the past 24 hours. Ether climbed back above $2,400, while SOL and ADA rose over support at $140 and 50 cents respectively. Crypto trading volumes also rebounded after a brutal Sunday-Monday flush that saw nearly $600 million in long liquidations. XRP XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, and dogecoin DOGE also rose between 4%-6%. The broader CoinDesk 20 CD20}], a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, rose over 3%. The bounce followed a wave of macro relief. Brent crude slipped 1.8% and S&P 500 futures turned positive, even as the ceasefire lacked formal confirmation from either government. But traders were quick to rotate back into altcoins, betting on a volatility cooldown. “We think the market will soon normalize and move on from the latest geopolitical episode,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “But we’re more worried about a bigger shake-out to stop out recent longs… and the negative FOMO signals from all the public companies looking to establish new BTC treasuries as their latest financial engineering gig,” Fan added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin {{BTC continues to consolidate near $105,000, testing overhead resistance as institutional flows hold steady. Some see structural strength in the asset's performance over the past few weeks. “Its ability to hold above $100K underscores resilience amid geopolitical and macro volatility,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk. “As institutional inflows and ETF demand rebound, BTC’s decoupling from traditional risk-off signals suggests a maturing role as a macro hedge in the long term,” Lu added. Still, some traders caution that the next leg of the move could be driven by profit-taking, especially in overheated tokens, such as ether.

2025-06-24T05:07:45,"Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street","The post Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Iran-Israel conflict shakes global markets, Trump Media is pushing forward with bold crypto moves. Founded by U.S. President Donald Trump, the company has just approved a $400 million stock buyback while reaffirming its strong commitment to digital assets. Meanwhile, Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire led to a 3.2% gain in Bitcoin’s value over 24 hours , with the cryptocurrency holding firm above the $100,000 mark despite the recent bloodbath. Stock Buyback Shows Confidence Trump Media has approved a $400 million stock buyback plan to return value to shareholders while signaling strong confidence in its long-term strategy. CEO Devin Nunes highlighted that with $3 billion on the company’s balance sheet, there’s enough flexibility to fund the buyback without affecting its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. Nunes called Bitcoin “a crown jewel” and said the repurchase is also meant to protect the company from what he described as discrimination against conservative businesses by financial institutions. The funds are part of a broader push to support Trump-branded crypto products, including upcoming ETFs, pending regulatory approval. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still on Track While the buyback grabbed headlines, the real game-changer is Trump Media’s ongoing plan to build a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury . The strategy, similar to what Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has done, signals the company’s intent to become a major crypto holder. The plan includes a private placement offering to fund the crypto reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement , In short, Trump Media is going all-in on crypto with fresh capital and bold plans. It filed to register nearly 85 million shares for resale and secured $2.3 billion through deals with about 50 investors, including $100 million from Chicago-based firm DRW. Additionally, the company has taken things a step further by filing for a combined Bitcoin-Ether ETF in partnership with Crypto.com. The fund is expected to hold 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum, aiming to capitalize on both leading cryptocurrencies. This funding supports its Bitcoin treasury strategy, though the company hasn’t revealed how much BTC it holds yet. Meanwhile, its stock (DJT) rose over 3% on Monday, hitting $18.39 after weeks of sharp declines. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

CEO Devin Nunes emphasized Bitcoin as a core asset that symbolizes financial freedom and independence—especially against what they describe as discrimination from traditional financial institutions. Will the SEC approve Trump Media’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF? It’s unclear. While the SEC has started approving Bitcoin ETFs, a politically affiliated company might face extra scrutiny. However, having a partner like Crypto.com may improve their chances. Is Trump Media really buying billions in Bitcoin, or is it all just hype? So far, Trump Media has announced a $2.3B Bitcoin treasury plan, but they haven’t disclosed actual purchases or wallet addresses. What’s the deal with the $400M stock buyback—why now? Redditors speculate it’s to boost investor confidence after sharp stock declines and distract from the lack of real Bitcoin on the balance sheet.

As the cryptocurrency attempts to hold a key support area, some analysts believe this make-or-break retest will determine its next big move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wobbles? Metaplanet Buys Big, Breaks $1 Billion Mark Cardano To See More Bleeding Cardano is recording a 4.5% daily increase after bouncing from the $0.51 area on Sunday. Notably, ADA was in a downtrend following its 3-year high of $1.32 in December 2024, which ended after the late April breakout and May bullish rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold its April-May range amid the June market pullback, losing the key $0.66 area ten days ago. Since then, Cardano has recorded seven consecutive red daily candles and fallen below the $0.60 support. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Cardano’s rally will be halted unless some ground is recovered. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency’s multi-month price action “ended up being a classic distribution schematic” after losing the $0.66 support. This would signal that ADA’s uptrend has ended and a potential downtrend is ahead. “As long as we don’t reclaim $0.66, just expect further downtrend from now on,” he asserted. Meanwhile, market watcher Man of Bitcoin highlighted the cryptocurrency’s June downtrend, affirming that if the price remains below the descending trendline, downward pressure will persist. He added that “One more low in wave iv is still possible,” hinting that a drop below the $0.50 could be on the horizon before the next wave up. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that “it should be a brief wick to the downside” as a “sustained break lower would weaken the bullish outlook.” ADA Retest To Trigger Rally To $1? Amid the ongoing global war tensions, ADA’s price retested the crucial $0.52 support on Sunday, hitting a four-month low of $0.51, before recovering and closing the week around the $0.54 mark. Market watcher Rose Premium Signals noted that a weekly close around the crucial $0.56 level would continue the possible double-bottom setup forming on ADA’s chart. The analyst added that a confirmed rebound from the $0.54-$0-56 area could send the price to the initial $0.99 target and set the stage for a climb toward the $1.20 and $1.50 resistances. On the contrary, failing to hold this area could see Cardano lose its six-month price range and retrace to the $0.32 level. Meanwhile, Crypto Billion affirmed that Cardano appears to be forming a potential triple bottom structure, which could lead to a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move As the cryptocurrency retested the $0.50-$0.52 area over the weekend, the analyst highlighted that this key range had been held twice before since the November breakout. Additionally, he pointed out that ADA’s price appears to be trading within a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which suggests a breakout toward the $1 mark if the price climbs toward the upper boundary. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.54, a 15.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-24T04:30:49,"Could Traders Rotating from Bitcoin and XRP to MAGACOIN FINANCE Spark a VeChain Surge?","Introduction The June 2025 market is seeing a dramatic shift in capital flow. As Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes above $105,000 and XRP’s rally slows, a new rotation trend is emerging. Early-stage plays are taking the spotlight, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the centerpiece. This surge in attention could trigger a ripple effect for overlooked altcoins—especially VeChain (VET), which technical analysts say may be next in line. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Money Is Moving Capital is flooding into MAGACOIN FINANCE , as both retail and institutional investors seek a structured early-stage asset with upside. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, a fully audited contract, and active staking rewards, the project is gaining rapid traction. Key highlights: 100% community-owned and inflation-proof All presale phases selling out in record time Forecast listing of $0.007 and upside ROI potential in 2025 Investor behavior shows strong conviction, with buyers holding rather than flipping. That long-term positioning is what’s driving the project’s credibility—and FOMO. VeChain (VET): Technical Setup and Market Attention VeChain is currently trading near $0.022, with many traders forecasting a climb toward $0.035 in June. Long-term consolidation has set the foundation for a potential breakout. While fundamentals in logistics and enterprise adoption remain strong, recent attention has shifted away—giving VET a chance to quietly build momentum under the radar. How MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Trigger a VET Move The current rotation from legacy coins into MAGACOIN FINANCE is unlocking broader liquidity. As capital exits the sidelines and moves toward higher-risk, higher-reward setups, altcoins with solid use cases like VeChain could see a wave of renewed interest. VET’s structure and timing align well for a bounce—especially if the MAGACOIN FINANCE rally leads sentiment across the board. Conclusion The rotation trend of 2025 is clear: Bitcoin and XRP profits are now fueling MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise—and VeChain may be the next to benefit. As traders look for the next undervalued gem, VET’s technical foundation and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum could prove to be the perfect combination.

Some believe this might happen before ETF approvals and the FedNow launch on July 14.

The most probable outcome, he says, is both parties accepting the summary judgment, along with a penalty and permanent injunction. The court is now waiting on a key SEC filing due by mid-August.

2025-06-24T04:00:11,"Bitcoin’s Drop Below $100k Sparks Bearish Chatter, But Data Says Something Else","Bitcoin has rebounded slightly after dropping below the $100,000 mark, a decline attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions. The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a “staircase” trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.

A new airdrop event by Midnight , a privacy-focused blockchain connected to Cardano, is now live, offering free NIGHT tokens to eligible ADA holders. And no, it’s not just a few tokens — the numbers are quite impressive . So, here’s how to claim your FREE Night token. What Is Midnight and Why Does It Matter? Midnight is a fully integrated partner chain of Cardano that utilizes Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for its security and governance. What sets it apart is its strong multichain strategy, targeting not only Cardano users but also holders on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more. However, the ongoing buzz is mostly around the “Glacier Drop”, the first phase of Midnight’s token distribution plan. According to the project’s whitepaper , 12 billion NIGHT tokens—half of the entire supply—will be given away to eligible users. And the largest beneficiary of this ecosystem will be the Cardano wallet holders. More Than Just an Airdrop—It’s Cardano’s Growth Catalyst What’s exciting is that Midnight isn’t some side project—it’s deeply tied into Cardano’s architecture. The NIGHT token is minted directly on Cardano. Stake pool operators (SPOs) can even earn NIGHT without giving up ADA rewards. With strong tokenomics, real utility, and multichain support, Midnight might be the boost Cardano needs to reclaim its spotlight in the crypto space. How to Claim Your NIGHT Tokens To be eligible for the Midnight airdrop, you must have held at least $100 worth of ADA in a Cardano wallet at the time of a previously taken snapshot. Midnight is bringing private smart contracts, cross-chain privacy, and dual-token mechanics ($NIGHT + $DUST ). It’s free to claim if you qualify — don’t miss it. For more alpha follow @onewisemelon — melon (@onewisemelon) June 23, 2025 The claiming process is simple and gas-free, just sign with your wallet and provide a clean Cardano address. There’s no KYC or cost involved. How Much NIGHT Could You Receive? However, each person’s airdrop amount depends on how much ADA they held compared to others. For example, if you held 5,000 ADA, and the total eligible pool was 1.5 billion ADA, you’d receive around 40,000 NIGHT tokens. How Much 1 NIGHT Token Worth? Now here’s where it gets interesting. If NIGHT reaches a $500 million market cap, each token could be worth around $0.0208, which means your free 40,000 NIGHT tokens could be worth over $800. There is a 60-day window to claim your tokens, and they won’t be usable right away. Meanwhile, claimed tokens will first be locked and will “thaw” gradually during the Redemption period, allowing holders to access them over time.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/midnight-airdrop-alert-heres-how-to-claim-your-free-night-tokens/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|AIRDROP","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) remain dominant forces, but many traders are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for its rare early-stage upside. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is also on the radar, though its recent volatility has prompted a shift in capital toward projects with stronger momentum and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about pre-sale of 2025 , with over $10 million raised and every phase selling out at record speed. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven tokenomics, full audit, and disciplined rollout as key reasons for its surge in demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a reputation for credibility and long-term potential, with experts’ analysis citing: Capped token supply and full HashEx audit , ensuring long-term integrity and no stealth inflation Strong retail and institutional interest , with momentum growing across altcoin trading communities Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin continues to set the tone for crypto markets, trading above $105,000 and attracting significant institutional inflows. While BTC remains a benchmark for bullish sentiment, its massive market cap now implies more stability and less explosive upside compared to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Many seasoned BTC holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking the kind of sharp returns that defined Bitcoin’s early years. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum, But Investors Seek More Solana is drawing strong forecasts, with some projecting 2025 highs between $220 and $1,000. Its ecosystem growth and potential ETF inclusion are fueling optimism. However, as SOL matures, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for its greater upside potential and scarcity-driven model. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Volatility Spurs Diversification NEAR Protocol is experiencing heightened volatility, recently dropping to $1.89 despite increased trading volume. While some analysts expect a potential recovery, the broader sentiment is cautious. With support levels weakening and resistance holding firm, investors are seeking more stable growth paths—leading many to diversify into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion In a market where timing and structure are everything, even a small investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could reshape portfolios for those who act early.

2025-06-24T03:00:47,"Analysts Explain Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Follow Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Path to Success with Polkadot","As the crypto market enters a new phase of growth, established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to set the pace, while Polkadot (DOT) maintains its reputation as a leading interoperability platform. Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a breakout contender, drawing comparisons to the early trajectories of these market leaders and positioning itself as a high-upside opportunity in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly building momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, supported by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, underpinned by a transparent governance structure and a strong community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Analysts note the project’s structured rollout and scarcity mechanics, which historically have produced outsized returns for early entrants. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Momentum and Market Anchor Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $112,000 and supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. Analysts see potential for BTC to reach $130,000–$200,000 if the current uptrend persists. While Bitcoin’s upside is steady, its early-stage success story is inspiring investors to seek similar growth in new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Network Strength Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, trading above $2,500 and benefiting from institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Growth Potential Polkadot is trading near $4.74, with forecasts pointing to a possible rise to $5.03 by the end of May 8 . While DOT’s gains are modest compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it remains a key player in the interoperability sector. Analysts highlight Polkadot’s long-term potential, but many investors are now seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market and Polkadot maintaining its role as a key interoperability platform, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could follow a similar path to success—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

2025-06-24T02:51:12,"Texas has created the first state-funded Bitcoin reserve","Texas has become the first US state to establish a publicly funded, stand-alone Bitcoin reserve after Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend. Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which approved similar legislation, Texas allowed the reserve and provided funding for it. The state has allocated $10 million to invest in the Bitcoin reserve. With this approach, Texas has made a significant step toward the future of finance. Trump’s pro-crypto stance attracts more US states to adopt Bitcoin reserves The Bill 21 requires the state to set up a Bitcoin reserve that operates separately from the main treasury. This aligns with a few other states also looking into digital asset reserves. The announcement that Texas has allocated $10 million for a Bitcoin reserve comes months after the Trump administration said it would establish a national crypto reserve. However, such a vehicle is supposed to be funded strictly by budget-neutral means, such as crypto asset seizures or issuing crypto bonds. Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that shields the Bitcoin reserve from standard “fund sweeps” into the state’s general revenue. The legislation changes how states handle digital assets, not just as speculative devices, but as sovereign financial instruments that one might want to hold onto for the long term. Texas sets up Bitcoin reserve to fight inflation and flex financial muscle Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), which finally allowed the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to the bill’s text, the new reserve will help make the state more financially resilient while acting as a potential hedge against inflation. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold only Bitcoin currently has. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund and be guided by an advisory committee with three crypto investment experts. Aside from direct purchases, the reserve could be filled through forks, airdrops, investment profits, or public crypto donations. A public report listing the fund’s holdings and performance will be issued every two years. With this, Texas becomes the third state in the US to pass Bitcoin reserve legislation. Public firms demonstrate a growing trend of purchasing more BTC for their treasuries Several publicly traded companies follow Michael Saylor’s strategy by adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For instance, on Friday, June 20, US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency adviser, David Bailey‘s Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, raised $51.5 million in new funds through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal to purchase more BTC. Moreover, last week, The Blockchain Group, a technology company listed in Paris, increased its Bitcoin reserves by buying 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. This purchase raised its total holdings to 1,653 BTC. Just over the past month, companies have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, a trend that has been documented with the help of data from BitcoinTreasuries. Furthermore, NET shows public companies still have an appetite for BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.
