2025-06-24T09:50:10,"Metaplanet’s Bold Strategic $5 Billion Bitcoin Capital Allocation to US Subsidiary","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Bold Strategic $5 Billion Bitcoin Capital Allocation to US Subsidiary In a move that has sent ripples across the global financial landscape, Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese firm renowned for its proactive embrace of Bitcoin (BTC), has announced an extraordinary expansion of its digital asset strategy. The company revealed on X its intention to allocate an additional capital of up to $5 billion to its U.S. subsidiary. This decisive action underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to integrate digital assets into their core financial frameworks, particularly when seeking optimal environments for growth and stability. Metaplanet’s commitment to strengthening its Bitcoin holdings through this substantial capital allocation is a testament to its long-term vision for the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet’s Pioneering Journey into Bitcoin and Digital Assets For those unfamiliar, Metaplanet has distinguished itself as a trailblazer among publicly traded companies in Japan by adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy in the United States, positioning Metaplanet as a key player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in Asia. Their initial foray into Bitcoin was driven by a desire to hedge against currency depreciation and seek long-term value appreciation, moving beyond traditional financial instruments. This latest announcement of an additional $5 billion in capital signifies not just a continuation, but a dramatic acceleration of their Bitcoin-centric strategy. It’s a clear signal that the company sees immense potential in Bitcoin, not merely as a speculative asset, but as a fundamental component of its future financial health. This move could inspire other Japanese and Asian corporations to re-evaluate their own treasury management strategies and consider a similar pivot towards digital assets . Why the US Subsidiary? Unpacking the ‘Optimal Conditions’ for Bitcoin Acquisition Metaplanet explicitly stated that the United States offers “optimal conditions” for acquiring and managing Bitcoin at scale. But what exactly makes the U.S. such an attractive destination for a Japanese firm looking to bolster its crypto holdings? Several factors likely contribute to this strategic choice: Regulatory Clarity (Comparatively): While the U.S. regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, it has seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has provided a degree of institutional comfort and established clear pathways for large-scale digital asset investments, offering more certainty than many other jurisdictions. Mature Market Infrastructure: The U.S. boasts a robust and sophisticated financial infrastructure, including well-established crypto exchanges, custody solutions, and liquidity providers capable of handling multi-billion dollar transactions. This infrastructure is crucial for efficient and secure large-scale Bitcoin acquisition. Access to Capital and Expertise: The U.S. financial market is deep and liquid, offering ample access to capital markets and a wealth of expertise in digital asset management, trading, and compliance. This allows companies like Metaplanet to leverage specialized knowledge and resources. Investor Base and Adoption: The U.S. has a large and increasingly sophisticated investor base with a growing appetite for Bitcoin and other digital assets, which can influence market stability and liquidity for large holders. By channeling this massive capital allocation through its US subsidiary , Metaplanet aims to capitalize on these favorable conditions, ensuring its Bitcoin acquisition strategy is executed with maximum efficiency and security. The Mechanics of a $5 Billion Capital Allocation: What Does it Mean? The phrase “up to an additional $5 billion” indicates a significant commitment, though the exact timeline and deployment strategy might be flexible. This capital could be deployed in various ways, primarily focused on accumulating more Bitcoin : Direct Bitcoin Purchases: The most straightforward approach would be direct market purchases of BTC, similar to MicroStrategy’s strategy. This would involve leveraging their U.S. subsidiary to execute large block trades or dollar-cost average into Bitcoin over time. Investment in Bitcoin-Related Products: While direct purchases are likely, some capital could also be allocated to Bitcoin-related investment vehicles, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, if they align with Metaplanet’s strategic goals for liquidity and custody. Infrastructure and Operational Expansion: A portion of the capital might also be used to expand the operational capabilities of the US subsidiary , ensuring it has the necessary infrastructure, talent, and security protocols to manage such a substantial digital asset portfolio. This $5 billion commitment is not just a financial decision; it’s a strategic declaration. It signals Metaplanet’s profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its readiness to make substantial, calculated bets on the future of digital assets within a preferred regulatory environment. Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal: Benefits and Considerations for Corporate Treasuries Metaplanet’s move highlights the compelling reasons why corporations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The primary benefits often cited include: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation and currency debasement, offering an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global accessibility position it as a modern store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering a higher upside compared to traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s treasury portfolio, reducing reliance on single asset classes and potentially enhancing overall returns. However, corporate adoption of Bitcoin is not without its considerations. Volatility remains a key factor, as do evolving regulatory frameworks and the complexities of secure custody. Metaplanet’s decision to route this through its US subsidiary suggests a careful consideration of these factors, aiming to mitigate risks by operating within a jurisdiction deemed “optimal.” This thoughtful approach to capital allocation is crucial for any company venturing into the digital asset space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption? Metaplanet’s monumental $5 billion capital allocation to its US subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition sends a powerful message to the global financial community. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable corporate treasury asset, even among companies outside the immediate Western financial sphere. This could trigger a domino effect, especially among other Japanese and Asian corporations that have been observing the crypto space cautiously. As regulatory clarity improves globally and the infrastructure for managing digital assets matures, more companies may follow Metaplanet’s lead, diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin. This trend, if it accelerates, will have profound implications for Bitcoin’s price discovery, market liquidity, and its overall integration into the mainstream financial system. For investors, Metaplanet’s move serves as another strong indicator of institutional conviction in Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is evolving from a niche speculative asset to a foundational element of corporate finance. Keeping an eye on similar announcements from other publicly traded companies will be crucial for understanding the broader trajectory of institutional crypto adoption. A Bold Leap Forward for Metaplanet and Bitcoin Metaplanet’s decision to inject an additional $5 billion into its U.S. subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition is nothing short of a bold and strategic maneuver. It highlights the company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the strategic advantage of operating within a jurisdiction that offers “optimal conditions” for digital asset management. This significant capital allocation not only reinforces Metaplanet ‘s position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption but also serves as a powerful testament to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the global economy. As more companies witness the potential benefits and navigate the complexities, Metaplanet’s pioneering spirit may well pave the way for a new era of corporate treasury management.

Let’s sort out the facts from the noise. What’s the Claim? Many posts on X and Telegram groups are saying, “If you held XRP during the snapshot, you’re getting NIGHT tokens for free.” It sounds exciting — who wouldn’t want free tokens just for holding crypto? So, What’s the Truth? Yes, XRP holders will receive NIGHT tokens, but only if they meet the eligibility. According to the official 45-page whitepaper released by the Midnight team, the airdrop is being shared across eight blockchains. These include Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, BAT, and XRP. To qualify, you needed to hold at least $100 worth of XRP when the snapshot was taken on June 11, 2025. There’s no need for KYC or any fees—claiming is as simple as signing with your wallet and submitting a valid Cardano address. However, the tokens will be locked at first, and 25% will unlock slowly over a year. How Did We Find That Out? The Midnight team detailed all of this in their whitepaper, breaking down the token supply and distribution plan. Out of the total NIGHT token supply, 50% (12 billion tokens) is set aside for Cardano (ADA) holders. Bitcoin (BTC) holders will receive the next biggest share, 20%, which is about 4.8 billion NIGHT tokens. The final 30% (7.2 billion NIGHT tokens) will be shared equally among six other blockchains: XRP, BAT, ETH, BNB, SOL, and AVAX. That means XRP holders are eligible to claim around 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens from this pool. So yes, if you held XRP during the eligible snapshot, you could qualify for a piece of that 1.2 billion NIGHT allocation. But your share depends on how much XRP you held at the snapshot time",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/fact-check-will-xrp-holders-receive-night-tokens/,"ADA|BAT|BTC|XRP|AIRDROP","Uncategorized",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T09:46:47,"Bitcoin Set for Biggest Mining Difficulty Drop Since July 2021","Mining difficulty on the Bitcoin BTC blockchain is on course to drop by the most since July 2021 after the amount of mining power securing the network slid about 30% in two weeks. According to data from Mempool.space , a downward difficulty adjustment of around 9% is projected within the next five days. That would be the most since the China mining ban four years ago, when the hashrate, the total computational power used to mine blocks, plummeted 50% to 58 exahashes per second (EH/s) and bitcoin was trading near $30,000. The difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to ensure that blocks continue to be mined at roughly 10-minute intervals. After the recent decline, the hashrate is now just under 700 EH/s, according to Glassnode data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading recently around $105,300. Significant hashrate and difficulty corrections are not unusual during the northern hemisphere's summer. Elevated electricity prices, driven by higher air conditioning demand and strained power grids, often lead miners to temporarily shut off machines, especially older or less efficient ones. This seasonal pattern has been observed in several previous years. The anticipated drop in mining difficulty will provide meaningful relief for miners. The hashprice, or miner revenue per exahash, currently sits at $51.9. This metric reflects the estimated daily income in dollars a miner earns per EH/s contributed to the network, based on block rewards and transaction fees. As difficulty decreases, mining becomes easier, meaning miners can earn more revenue for the same amount of computational effort. Assuming bitcoin’s price and transaction fees remain stable or increase, the hashprice should rise significantly in the coming days, helping to offset recent profitability pressure.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/bitcoin-set-for-biggest-mining-difficulty-drop-since-july-2021,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Mining Difficulty|Hashrate|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin’s climb past $106K earlier today was cut short as news broke that Iran had violated a ceasefire deal with Israel, just hours after it was supposedly brokered by US President Donald Trump. The sudden escalation sent shockwaves through the market, triggering over $500 million in crypto liquidations within the hour. Long positions were hit the hardest as the market reversed. By press time, Bitcoin had slipped back below $105K, giving up most of its earlier gains. Ceasefire Off the Table, Tensions Spike What triggered the panic? Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, announced “intense strikes” on Tehran after accusing Iran of breaking the US-Qatar-mediated truce. The situation escalated rapidly, with the Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir stating. ""In light of the severe violation of the ceasefire carried out by the Iranian regime, we will respond with force."" -The Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir in a situational assessment now — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) June 24, 2025 Iran has denied any ceasefire breach, but its top security council says the nation is fully prepared to retaliate if provoked. The ceasefire was meant to de-escalate regional tensions. But with missiles now back on the table, global markets are on edge, and crypto is once again acting as a volatility sponge. $500M Liquidated: Crypto Whales Take a Hit With the ceasefire unraveling in real time, traders scrambled. Liquidations soared to $500 million, signaling panic among leveraged long positions. The sudden move has shaken confidence just as Bitcoin was reclaiming bullish territory. “Time to Buy the Dip,” Says Van de Poppe Despite the turbulence, some seasoned traders see opportunity. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe believes Bitcoin is still in an upward trend, calling the pullback a healthy retest. “Bitcoin has a trendswitch. It’s uptrending now, after we’ve had a massive liquidation crash taking place to sub $100K. It broke through $103K and hit the next resistance. Time to be buying the dip…” For dip buyers, $103K may be the key accumulation zone to watch. Trump Turns Up the Heat on the Fed Beyond the battlefield, Trump had more to say – this time targeting the Federal Reserve. In a pointed post on Truth Social, the president slammed Fed Chair Jerome Powell for holding rates steady at the June FOMC meeting. “No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus.” Trump also said if the cuts don’t work out, Powell could hike again but warned Congress to “work this very dumb, hardheaded person over.” What Now for Crypto? Between rising geopolitical tensions and renewed pressure on the Fed, the crypto market is caught in the middle. Bitcoin’s recent pullback might just be noise or the start of a bigger shift. Either way, traders now have more than just price charts to worry about.

As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s price hit $106,000 immediately after Donald Trump announced that there’s been an agreement for ceasefire between Israel and Iran that’s already “in effect.” As seen in the chart below, the price rallied from a low of around $99,600 to a high above $106,000 in a matter of hours, sparking a considerable wave of short liquidations across the derivatives market. Source: TradingView At the time of this writing, BTC trades at around $105,400, up 3.9% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency remains 1.3% down for the week but the recovery seems to have started and, hopefully, it will continue. However, for this to happen, both Israel and Iran need to honor the agreement. Unfortunately, according to a report from CNN, Israel accused Iran of firing missiles and vowed to strike back, while Tehran denied violating the ceasefire agreement. The market remains volatile and over $500 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.

2025-06-24T09:44:20,"The “silent” co-founder of Ripple speaks for the firs time in 14 years","Arthur Britto, the “silent” co-founder of Ripple Labs and architect behind the XRP Ledger, made his first public communication on social media after 14 years of silence. The reticent figure, known for his secrecy and absence from public life, posted a single emoji on X late Monday, prompting an 8% surge in the value of XRP within 24 hours. Britto posted a single “face without mouth” emoji from his X account created in August 2011. Regardless of his intent, the XRP’s community reaction was immediate, largely due to his status as a founder who has avoided the spotlight since Ripple’s inception. Asserting that “it was not a hack or compromise,” David Schwartz—currently chief technology officer at Ripple and co-creator of the XRP Ledger—verified that Britto was the one who sent the message. ‘Ghost’ XRPL co-creator speaks after years of silence Not much is known about Arthur Britto, but according to Shwartz, he co-created the XRP Ledger in 2012 alongside Jed McCaleb, the latter also known for founding Mt. Gox and later the Stellar blockchain. Together, they launched what was initially known as NewCoin, later renamed OpenCoin, and finally Ripple Labs. In 2015, he slapped Jed McCaleb with a lawsuit, accusing him of breaching a contract by launching Stellar and allegedly copying Ripple’s code. The case was reportedly settled out of court, and the full terms of the settlement were never publicly disclosed. Though instrumental in building XRPL , Britto has stayed almost entirely invisible. He has never given a public interview, never appeared at a public event, and no verified photographs of him exist. His name is in public records and legal filings, but outside of official documentation, Britto’s persona has been more myth than man. The XRP co-founder is also listed as the founder and president of PolySign, a blockchain infrastructure firm. He also briefly served as a director at Bitstamp in 2014 before his role was terminated in 2015. Real, but as private as Satoshi Britto’s privacy has led to theories that he might be a pseudonym or not a real person. Others believe he is the person behind crypto’s most famous pseudonym, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. “ He is so private that he’s one of my dark horse candidates for being Satosh i,” one Reddit user remarked. David Schwartz addressed these rumors in a November 2023 post, proving Britto’s existence, adding that the developer is very insistent on privacy. “ He is a separate and distinct human being in his own right. But he is intensely private ,” Schwartz dispelled the chatter that Britto is a ghost in the Ripple machine. Additional evidence of Britto’s identity was found in a Ripple community post circulating on X earlier this month. The post included a 2012 agreement signed by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto. Dated September 17, the document awarded Britto 2% of all XRP, then referred to as “Ripple Credits,” and granted him lifetime rights to build on the Ripple protocol without needing future permission. Schwartz confirmed the document’s authenticity and noted that he is in contact with Britto. XRP price rally after community excitement After dropping to an intraday low of $1.97 one hour after Britto posted the emoji, XRP has climbed up 8.1% in the last day. Many traders interpreted the post as a bullish signal, buoyed by its cryptic nature. “ Bullrun confirmed? Too early to say. But Arthur Britto doesn’t casually drop breadcrumbs. When someone this silent speaks … you listen. In crypto, silence can be louder than noise. And Britto just broke his. Stay alert. Something’s coming ,” reckoned XRP enthusiast John Squire .

2025-06-24T09:42:40,"Blockchains Solutions like JPMorgan’s JPMD Could Make tGlobal Economy 100x Better: Start with Best Wallet","The dated COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) system may become a thing of the past thanks to increasing blockchain innovation and adoption by the world’s banking system. At least this is what Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and Head of Protocol at Coinbase, told Unchained in a recent interview: ‘The global economy is going to work 100 times better because it’s using this new technology that lets us move money in a permissionless, programmable way.’ — Jesse Pollak, Unchained Podcast What is COBOL? COBOL is one of the oldest high-level programming languages, developed in the late 1950s for business applications and administrative systems in business, finance, and other areas. Despite being in use in most banking systems, it faces issues related to its inefficiency, reliance on a niche language, limited libraries, and lack of support for multimedia processing, machine learning, and graphical UI. JPMorgan’s JPMD Changes the Game JPMorgan just announced its JPMD (J.P. Morgan Deposit Token), which essentially incorporates blockchain technology into its payment system. As stated in the press release: ‘JPMD – and Deposit Tokens in general – match the novel and distinctive properties of stablecoins, most notably the ability to conduct peer-to-peer transactions with programmability. As such, Deposit Tokens and stablecoins can be applied to similar use cases.’ — JPMorgan, Deposit Tokens This could signal the first step towards the abolition of COBOL, which, according to a Reuters report , is still in use in over 43% of the world’s banks. According to John Duigenan, General Manager of Financial Services at IBM Technology, the dinosaur systems the banks are still using highlight the lack of innovation in the banking industry. ‘In order for banks to offer new services … they have to be able to modernise and transform — and many are struggling with the fact that they have hyper-integrated monolithic systems from 50 years ago.’ — John Duigenan, Interview In contrast, the JPMD system lets whitelisted customers transfer their JPMorgan deposits to Coinbase’s BASE and move money far more efficiently than COBOL ever could. This is what Jesse Pollak meant when he said that blockchain integration will help the economy work 100x better. In this evolving financial context, the adoption of new tools like Best Wallet is another step in the right direction. How Best Wallet Contributes to a More User-Friendly Financial System Best Wallet is a non-custodial, no-KYC, and free-to-use crypto wallet with a user-friendly interface, live charts, and a Token Launchpad. The latter alerts you to hot new tokens, so you can buy early and potentially maximize your ROI. Best Wallet is available to use right now, but it’s also under continuous development, intending to expand its reach and implement new services across four phases. An NFT gallery, support for over 60 chains, market intel analytics, and MEV protection are all in the pipeline, as the project gains traction and sees wider adoption. Best Wallet’s native token, $BEST is now in presale and has already accumulated over $13.5M, with a current token price of $0.025225. The token supports Best Wallet’s development cycle while offering holders exclusive perks within Best Wallet’s ecosystem. These include governance rights, reduced on-chain transaction fees, and early access to new features and projects. Based on Best Wallet’s utility, ease-of-use, and ambitious roadmap, our analysts predict that $BEST will steam up the charts post-release. We’re looking at a potential price point of $0.072 by the end of the year, which represents a growth of 185% from today’s price of $0.025225. With a projected 1B users by 2030, $BEST could reach $0.82 or higher, for an ROI of 3,150% if you invest today. This makes $BEST one of the best crypto presales of 2025. If you want to join the presale to take advantage of the $BEST pre-launch price and the staking APY of 103%, go to the presale page and buy your stack of $BEST today. The Future of Banking is Blockchain With finance giants like JPMorgan already making the transition to digital assets and blockchain services, the signs are clear: the world’s banking system is heading straight to tokenization. In this ever-changing financial context, innovative, user-focused services like Best Wallet will drive the transition from the classical banking system to blockchain-based ones.

While specifics on implementation remain unclear, the move marks a notable shift for the regulator overseeing major entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. FHFA Becomes a Pillar of US Housing Stability Created in the aftermath of the 2008 housing crisis, the FHFA has historically focused on risk reduction and ensuring liquidity in the housing market. Now, it may become one of the first federal housing agencies to consider digital assets in mortgage lending criteria. Bill Pulte, appointed director in March after being nominated by former President Donald Trump, brings a unique background to the role. He is the founder of Pulte Capital Partners and the grandson of William Pulte, who founded Pulte Homes, currently the third-largest homebuilder in the US. Smart — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) June 24, 2025 Pulte has been vocal about his support for cryptocurrency. Financial disclosures earlier this year revealed he holds between $500,001 and $1 million in both Bitcoin and Solana. His portfolio also includes shares in Marathon Digital (MARA), a major bitcoin mining firm, as well as investments in GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond, Tesla, and ventures tied to YouTube personality MrBeast. Pulte entered the crypto space in 2019, publicly announcing a purchase of 11 BTC and pledging to distribute crypto to his social media followers. His interest in digital assets appears to extend beyond personal finance, potentially influencing policy at the national level. Bitcoin Adoption Finds Momentum Among States Bitcoin adoption is accelerating across both federal and state levels in the US. Texas recently became the first state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, following the approval of Senate Bill 21 signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The reserve, managed by State Comptroller Glenn Hegar, will operate independently from the state treasury, a key distinction from earlier proposals in Arizona and New Hampshire, which were tied to existing government funds. At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, signaling growing institutional interest in the asset. While Texas moves forward with its Bitcoin initiative, other states are pulling back. Florida, Arizona, and several others have recently shelved or rejected crypto-related legislation, citing concerns over market volatility and the uncertain future of digital assets.

2025-06-24T09:20:23,"Trump’s Breakthrough: Iran-Israel Ceasefire Sparks Hope for Global Stability","BitcoinWorld Trump’s Breakthrough: Iran-Israel Ceasefire Sparks Hope for Global Stability In a surprising and potentially monumental development, U.S. President Donald Trump recently took to his Truth Social platform to announce that an Iran-Israel ceasefire is now in effect. This declaration, if upheld by all parties, carries immense weight for global affairs, promising a potential shift towards greater geopolitical stability in a region long plagued by tension. For those of us navigating the often-volatile waters of the cryptocurrency world, such news isn’t just a headline; it’s a critical signal that could ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from traditional stocks to the burgeoning digital asset space. Understanding the Iran-Israel Ceasefire Announcement The news broke directly from Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, a platform that has increasingly become a source for his public statements. The simplicity of the announcement belies its potential complexity and significance: a ceasefire, an agreement to halt hostilities, between two nations whose relationship has been defined by decades of antagonism and proxy conflicts. This isn’t merely a pause; it’s presented as an active agreement that all parties are now called upon to uphold. Direct Communication: The use of Truth Social highlights the evolving landscape of diplomatic communication, allowing for immediate dissemination of high-stakes information. Call to Uphold: Trump’s emphasis on all parties upholding the agreement underscores the fragility and importance of adherence for its success. Immediate Impact: Such an announcement can immediately influence market sentiment, shifting from fear to cautious optimism. The implications of a verifiable and sustained Iran-Israel ceasefire extend far beyond the immediate region. It touches upon energy markets, global trade routes, and international diplomacy, creating a domino effect that reaches into every corner of the global economy, including the often-unpredictable crypto market impact . What Does Geopolitical Stability Mean for Global Markets? When tensions rise in critical regions like the Middle East, financial markets often react with apprehension. Investors seek safety, leading to capital flight from riskier assets. Conversely, signs of de-escalation and geopolitical stability tend to foster confidence, encouraging investment and growth. Historically, periods of conflict have seen: Oil Price Volatility: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Stability can lead to more predictable supply and potentially lower prices. Stock Market Fluctuations: Major indices often dip during crises as investor confidence wanes. Stability can bring a rebound. Safe-Haven Asset Demand: Gold, U.S. Treasuries, and increasingly, Bitcoin, often see increased demand during uncertainty. A confirmed ceasefire could signal a reduction in systemic risk, potentially calming nerves across all asset classes. This newfound stability might redirect capital flows, impacting everything from commodity prices to technology stocks. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven? The cryptocurrency market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts. While often seen as uncorrelated, major global events inevitably cast a long shadow over digital assets. The news of an Iran-Israel ceasefire could have a multi-faceted crypto market impact . Many in the crypto community champion Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold – a true Bitcoin safe haven asset. The theory is that in times of geopolitical turmoil or economic uncertainty, investors will flock to Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from traditional financial systems. Let’s look at this: Asset Type Reaction to Instability Reaction to Stability Traditional Stocks Typically decline (risk-off) Tend to rally (risk-on) Gold Often rises (traditional safe haven) May stabilize or slightly decline U.S. Treasuries Rally (flight to safety) Yields may rise (less demand for safety) Bitcoin Mixed; sometimes acts as safe haven, sometimes correlates with tech stocks Potential for increased adoption if stability fosters innovation If the ceasefire holds, the immediate reaction might be a slight dip in Bitcoin’s price as some ‘safe haven’ demand diminishes. However, sustained global peace efforts and stability could also pave the way for broader institutional adoption and a more mature crypto market, as confidence in the overall global economic outlook improves. A stable environment encourages innovation and long-term investment, which could ultimately benefit the crypto space by attracting new users and capital. The Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Global Peace Efforts While the announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire is undoubtedly positive, the path to lasting peace is rarely straightforward. There are significant challenges that lie ahead for global peace efforts : Verification and Monitoring: Ensuring all parties adhere to the agreement requires robust verification mechanisms. Addressing Root Causes: A ceasefire addresses symptoms, but underlying political, economic, and social issues need long-term solutions. Regional Actors: The involvement and cooperation of other regional and international powers will be crucial. Trust Building: Decades of mistrust cannot be undone overnight; consistent diplomatic efforts are essential. Despite these hurdles, the opportunity for a new era of stability in the Middle East is immense. Reduced conflict can free up resources for economic development, improve humanitarian conditions, and foster greater regional cooperation. For the global economy, this translates into more predictable supply chains, stable energy prices, and a more confident investment climate. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Community? For investors, this news underscores the importance of staying informed about geopolitical developments. While the initial reaction to such news might be a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, it’s crucial to consider the long-term implications. For the crypto community, it highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role and the broader market’s sensitivity to global events. Actionable Insights: Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional and digital assets, can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Geopolitical news can turn markets quickly. Keep an eye on official announcements and reputable news sources. Understand Bitcoin’s Nuance: While a Bitcoin safe haven narrative exists, its correlation with traditional markets can vary. It’s not a guaranteed hedge against all forms of instability. Look Beyond the Headlines: A ceasefire is a step, not the destination. Assess whether the underlying conditions for lasting peace are being addressed. The potential for reduced tensions in the Middle East is a significant positive signal for geopolitical stability . While the immediate crypto market impact may vary, the long-term prospects for innovation and growth in a more peaceful world are undoubtedly brighter. A New Horizon for Peace and Prosperity? Donald Trump’s announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire marks a pivotal moment, offering a glimpse of a future where dialogue replaces conflict. While the path to enduring global peace efforts is fraught with challenges, this initial step provides a foundation upon which greater stability can be built. For the financial world, particularly the crypto market, this development is a reminder that global events are inextricably linked to market dynamics. As we move forward, the hope is that this ceasefire will not just be a temporary halt but a catalyst for sustained de-escalation, paving the way for a more secure and prosperous global landscape for all.

2025-06-24T09:17:56,"Crypto tax Australia: How does Australia tax their crypto?","A recent ruling in a criminal court case classified crypto assets as money, which goes against the long-held crypto tax Australian office that counts crypto as capital gains. A court decision involving a federal police officer who allegedly stole 81.6 BTC in 2019 has resurfaced as more traders are contesting how cryptocurrency should be taxed in Australia . On May 19, Judge Michael O’Connell ruled that Bitcoin ( BTC ) should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. This means that the judge declared that Bitcoin is more similar to the Australian dollar, rather than a speculative asset like gold , shares or foreign currency. According to the Australian Taxation Office website , crypto tax Australia classifies crypto under property instead of currency. More specifically, crypto falls under capital gains tax under the current framework used by the taxation office. You might also like: South Korea to postpone Crypto Tax bill to 2027 As of June 24, the website still categorizes crypto under property with capital gains on swaps, DeFi, and wrapped tokens. However the ruling could mean that Bitcoin falls under fiat currency, potentially exempting it from the current capital gains tax framework. How is crypto tax Australia operated? Under the current framework, crypto is seen as an investment. Therefore, crypto assets fall under the capital gains tax mechanism. According to the website, activities that involve making transactions with crypto —such as selling, swapping or spending crypto— is considered a capital gains tax event. On the other hand, the revenue generated from mining, staking, or earning crypto counts as ordinary income instead of capital gains. In those cases, then the ordinary income tax would be applied to the profit. However, crypto assets meant for personal use with a value of below AUD 10,000 ($6,503) is considered an exemption to the capital gains tax. But anything above the threshold would be subject to CGT under the crypto tax Australia framework. Most recently, Australia introduced cash transaction limits for crypto ATMs. The regulation mandates crypto ATM operators to implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars or equal to $3,251. Not only that, operators must also display notices, warning users of potential fraud risks.

2025-06-24T09:15:30,"New US Banking Cartel Forming As JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Others Dominate American Deposits, Warns ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman","Legendary investor Steve Eisman is warning the public about the possible emergence of a “cartel” of major banks in the US, which he says could impact the cost of financial services. The Wall Street veteran notes in a new interview with The Compound that there hasn’t been a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the banking sector since the 1990s. “It’s been very much discouraged post Dodd-Frank, so you’ve had very, very little M&A. But I actually think as a country we need [a wave of M&A]. And the reason why I say that is here’s an interesting statistic: in 2007, JPMorgan’s share of deposits in the United States was 7%, today it’s close to 14%. Now, there are a couple of reasons for that: number one is the cost of regulation is very, very high, and they can bear that more easily, and number two, which is probably even more important, is the cost of technology has exploded, and you need to be really big so you can pay for it. So if we do nothing and we keep the current policies and there’s no M&A wave, what’s going to happen is JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and a handful of others will continue to take market share, the other regional banks are going to wither on the vine, and what you’ll have left is a couple of very, very large banks and some community banks.” Eisman, whose bet against the housing market was famously profiled in parts of Michael Lewis’ book “The Big Short,” says financial institutions like US Bank and Comerica should merge to compete with the giant firms. “I don’t want to be Canada, where it’s basically a cartel, and so therefore those banks get to charge a lot more to customers.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-24T09:04:57,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Could Make Early Investors Wealthy Within Months","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Could Make Early Investors Wealthy Within Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s historic rise created thousands of crypto millionaires. But almost none of them entered during the hype cycles. The life-changing gains happened early — when Bitcoin was still underpriced, underused, and mostly overlooked. Today, Bitcoin Solaris is pulling attention from analysts for the same reasons. It’s distributing tokens before listings, it’s already delivering user rewards, and it’s capped at 21 million supply — just like BTC. The token is priced at $9 in phase 9 of the presale. Over $5 million has been raised, and more than 11,500 holders are in. But the real value isn’t just in the numbers. It’s in the systems already working and the upside still on the table. Removing the Hardware Barriers Bitcoin Solaris makes mining accessible again. The Nova App turns smartphones into contributors to the network. During closed beta, users earned BTC-S using their devices’ idle CPU and storage — the system ties directly into the chain’s validation layer. This is possible because the blockchain uses a hybrid consensus. The base operates on Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity, offering security without over-reliance on energy or hardware. The Solaris Layer builds scalability using Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Time. Together, they’ve supported testnet speeds above 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality. Nova is now progressing toward public rollout. The economics are already visible. Users mine. Rewards are earned. The system works — and that’s what turns entry-level capital into early mover advantage. BTC-S Rewards Are Already Flowing The token isn’t locked or idle. It powers rewards in the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — a fully live platform where users spin daily for token payouts. Every verified wallet receives one free spin per day. Larger presale purchases unlock tiers with higher potential returns, including up to 0.5 BTC in bonus rewards. All payouts are on-chain and verifiable. Rewards are currently issued on Solana and will migrate 1:1 to the native Bitcoin Solaris chain at launch. That gives presale participants working access to a real token economy before exchange listings begin. Token Galaxy featured Bitcoin Solaris recently and said, “This isn’t a whitepaper investment — it’s an early-access economy where users are already earning.” Supply Is Capped, Pricing Is Fixed Bitcoin Solaris is limited to 21 million BTC-S. Only 4.2 million are available through presale. That figure doesn’t shift. There are no hidden unlocks, no delayed team emissions, and no inflation mechanics to dilute the pool later. Current entry is $8 per token — with a projected launch target of $20. That’s over 150% upside based strictly on price, without accounting for rewards, mining returns, or external exchange interest post-listing. And unlike most presales, there’s no pricing curve or bonus game. Everyone enters at the same terms — which is part of what’s pulling in capital from investors who know how these market cycles work. Audited Infrastructure, KYC-Verified Team, Real Timeline Bitcoin Solaris passed a full audit by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining engine passed a separate audit from Freshcoins . The team is fully KYC verified , and development progress is already visible. The public testnet is scheduled for this year. Wallet upgrades and a full dev toolkit are on track. The Mining Power Marketplace — allowing compute rentals and tokenized processing power — is actively in development. Bitcoin Solaris is getting early attention for the right reasons: real systems, fixed tokenomics, and functional distribution ahead of the market. That’s exactly how Bitcoin created wealth for its first wave of adopters. This time, the structure is clearer, the upside is measurable, and the $8 window is still open.

2025-06-24T09:00:19,"Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $106K After Trump-Brokered Ceasefire","Bitcoin reclaimed the $106,000 level on Monday, recovering from a brief drop below $98,500 the day before . The rebound followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, which calmed global markets and helped restore confidence among risk-on investors. Despite the sharp price movement , Bitcoin’s derivatives market showed surprising resilience. The downturn triggered $193 million in liquidations of long leveraged positions, roughly 0.3% of total open interest. Still, the total value of leveraged positions remains steady at around $68 billion, suggesting that most traders are holding their positions rather than exiting in panic. The 4.4% drop over 12 hours, while notable, is not unprecedented. Similar dips have occurred three times over the last month. While traders remain cautious, especially given ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, many believe BTC has strong enough momentum to retest the $110,000 level in the coming days—assuming further escalation is avoided. Bitcoin Mining Activity Shows Signs of Stress One potential area of concern is Bitcoin’s hashrate, which dropped 8% between Sunday and Thursday—from 943.6 million terahashes per second (TH/s) to 865.1 million TH/s. Some market observers speculated that mining disruptions in Iran or neighboring regions may have contributed to the decline, especially amid reports that unauthorized Iranian miners consume up to 2 gigawatts of electricity. However, these estimates remain speculative due to the lack of verifiable data. Experts like Daniel Batten cautioned against drawing direct geopolitical conclusions from short-term hashrate fluctuations. In many cases, similar declines have been linked to temporary power issues elsewhere. For instance, on April 22, a 27% drop in hashrate followed intense storms and tornadoes across Texas and Oklahoma, which severely disrupted local power grids and mining operations. Interest Rate Bets Fuel Further Optimism Alongside Bitcoin’s recovery, oil prices dropped sharply after peaking at $77 on Sunday. This shift, paired with a 1% rise in the S&P 500, bolstered expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut . According to CME’s FedWatch tool, the probability of rates remaining at 4.25% through November dropped to just 8.4%, while the odds of a cut to 3.75% or lower rose to 53%. Although Bitcoin’s next move is uncertain, its swift recovery above $100K suggests that institutional demand remains strong—regardless of short-term geopolitical or macroeconomic concerns.

2025-06-24T08:57:21,"Best crypto to buy now as markets recover after ceasefire agreement","The cryptocurrency market rallied on Tuesday, recovering sharply from weekend losses as geopolitical tensions showed signs of easing. Major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, led the rebound, buoyed by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran . The president referred to the potential resolution as the end of “The 12-Day War.” The announcement appears to have calmed investor nerves across risk asset markets, with the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation rising over 4% to $3.27 trillion. The recovery follows a volatile weekend, during which Bitcoin briefly dipped below $98,500 amid reports of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. With geopolitical risk subsiding—at least temporarily—market focus is shifting back to macroeconomic drivers and upcoming regulatory developments. In this shifting environment, risk-averse investors are looking at early-stage projects that have consistently garnered investor interest. One such project is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has continued to see strong inflows. The Iran-Israel ceasefire Just hours after Iran launched a highly anticipated and largely symbolic counterstrike in response to the US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, formally halting hostilities after 12 days of conflict. The ceasefire follows a carefully choreographed exchange that allowed both nations to declare strategic and political victories, creating space for de-escalation without appearing to back down. For Israel, the military campaign—dubbed Operation Rising Lion—is being hailed as a success. The Israeli government claims to have dealt a significant blow to Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, eliminated key military personnel and scientists, and forced the US into taking direct action—a move previous American administrations had consistently avoided. For Iran, while the cost has been steep—extensive damage to infrastructure, displacement of tens of thousands, and a battered economy under sanctions—the end of aerial bombardment brings a measure of relief. With a population reeling from conflict and economic instability, the ceasefire provides an opportunity to begin the arduous task of reconstruction. Though fragile, the truce reflects a mutual understanding: further escalation risked drawing in more regional actors and jeopardising broader geopolitical stability. Bitcoin Pepe presale remains strong The cryptocurrency market has seen a period of heightened volatility in recent months, with sharp rallies, deep corrections, and shifting investor sentiment shaping trading activity. Yet amid these unstable conditions, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has remained notably resilient, continuing to attract steady capital inflows. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to bridge the cultural appeal of meme tokens with the technical robustness of Layer 2 infrastructure. It combines Bitcoin’s base-layer security with scalability attributes often associated with networks like Solana. This approach sets it apart from most meme coins that offer little beyond community hype. To accelerate the development of its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has partnered with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, underscoring its intent to build a viable utility layer around the meme narrative. The project’s hybrid model—infusing technical credibility into a meme coin framework—appears to be gaining traction. The presale has already raised over $15.4 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416. That figure is expected to rise, with a pricing tier adjustment set to trigger at the $15.54 million mark. Bitcoin Pepe is slated to list on MEXC and BitMart, which is expected to improve market liquidity and broaden exposure.

Global Bitcoin Holding Leaders (Entities & Governments) Rank Entity Estimated BTC Holdings Value (USD) 1 Satoshi Nakamoto 1.1M BTC $100B+ 2 BlackRock 662,871 BTC $71.3B 3 Binance 611,520 BTC $65.8B 4 Fidelity 349,396 BTC $37.6B 5 Grayscale 233,591 BTC $25.1B 6 US Government 198,012 BTC $21.3B 7 China Government 194,000 BTC $20.8B 8 Bitfinex 149,720 BTC $16.1B These entities collectively hold over 3 million BTC, reflecting long-term belief in Bitcoin as a sovereign and institutional asset. Conclusion: The Institutional Bitcoin Era Is Here The corporate accumulation of Bitcoin in 2025 marks a turning point in global finance. With public firms now holding more Bitcoin than the annual supply and private firms quietly amassing large reserves, Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset—it’s a mainstream corporate treasury standard.While price volatility remains, the adoption curve indicates that strategic Bitcoin reserves are becoming the norm, not the exception. The trend is expected to continue as more companies—particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and North America—announce their Bitcoin treasury models. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yep, it absolutely is. Public company holdings more than doubled from 2024 — from 64 companies to 151. Firms are no longer experimenting — they’re going all in, especially after the U.S. government signaled policy support. Did companies really buy more Bitcoin than what was mined in 2025? Yes, and it’s kinda wild. The total BTC mined this year is around 164,250 BTC , but corporate holdings have eclipsed 725,000 BTC just from public companies alone. Add private firms to that and you’re looking at 1M+ BTC in corporate wallets. Which public companies are leading in Bitcoin holdings? There’s frequent debate and sharing of lists about top holders like MicroStrategy (now Strategy Inc.), Marathon Digital, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital. Users track these companies’ quarterly filings and press releases to stay updated on their Bitcoin reserves. How do companies acquire their Bitcoin reserves? Forum members highlight two main strategies: direct purchase on the open market and accumulation through mining (as seen with Marathon and Hut 8). Some companies also use dollar-cost averaging or allocate a portion of profits to steady Bitcoin accumulation How do corporate Bitcoin holdings affect the market? Many users speculate that large corporate purchases can drive price surges, reduce circulating supply, and influence retail investor sentiment. There’s also concern about centralization if too much Bitcoin is held by a few large entities. who holds the most Bitcoin overall in 2025? In 2025, Satoshi Nakamoto remains the largest Bitcoin holder with approximately 1.1 million BTC. He is followed by major institutional players like BlackRock, holding around 662,000 BTC, and Binance with about 611,000 BTC. Other significant holders include Fidelity, Grayscale, Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), and several national governments. Which new companies are jumping into Bitcoin this year? In 2025, several new companies are jumping into Bitcoin, including Davis Commodities , SolarBank , River Financial , Worksport , and Mercurity Fintech . Most of these firms are early-stage buyers , just beginning to build their BTC reserves.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/research-report/global-corporations-bitcoin-holdings-2025/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED","Research Report",cryptocompare

The new funding will expand the plan to build up Metaplanet’s BTC treasury. Metaplanet, one of the high-profile BTC treasury companies, announced a plan to aggressively capitalize its US-based subsidiary. The new capital injection of up to $5B will aim to expand Metaplanet’s BTC treasury model. The Japanese company announced the additional capitalization as part of its ‘555 million plan’. The funding will be allocated to the Florida-based Metaplanet Treasury Corp. *Notice of Additional Capital Contribution to U.S. Subsidiary* pic.twitter.com/5dWd5Y3s40 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 24, 2025 The expansion of the US subsidiary will allow the company to access markets with deeper liquidity. Currently, Metaplanet found sufficient BTC from Japanese exchanges, using the BitFlyer market. Recently, the company also bought BTC from the wallets of QCP Capital. Metaplanet is also one of the companies with a fully transparent treasury and known cold wallets. Corporate purchases rely on diminishing sources of BTC available through exchanges and OTC desks, and are considered the main factor for the creation of coin scarcity. On a weekly basis, corporate purchases often reach three times the amount of newly mined BTC. The company now holds 11,111 BTC, surpassing its previous plans of buying up to 10K BTC by the end of 2025. The ability to buy more BTC hinged on the rally of the Metaplanet stock price. In the past six months, the shares expanded by 1,250%, peaking at 1,895 JPY (around $13.05). Metaplanet saw one of the biggest rallies among BTC treasury companies, allowing it to accelerate the recent BTC purchases. | Source: Google Finance In the past weeks, Metaplanet has outperformed Strategy (MSTR) with a more relentless climb, allowing for the latest large purchases. However, Metaplanet has only 0.000018 BTC per share, a factor of 100 lower than Strategy. The Japanese company also started out at a later stage, with an average BTC purchase price of $95,869. After the latest BTC purchases, Metaplanet is climbing the ranks of treasury companies, which are becoming even more exclusive. In the past week, Metaplanet added another 1,111 BTC to its reserves, becoming the eight-largest holder and closing in on Tesla, Inc. The latest addition surpassed Strategy’s weekly purchase, which this time shrank to just 245 BTC . Metaplanet aims at an international market presence Metaplanet is making more aggressive moves, aiming for a global presence and a much higher BTC treasury. Currently, small-scale companies are also announcing BTC purchases, with some treasuries as low as 10 BTC. The Japanese company also boosted the Market Vector index of crypto companies, which has been on a non-stop expansion since the lows in April. The requirement for treasuries is now around 21 BTC to join the top 100 buyers. Metaplanet is competing with aggressive acquisitions, where the top 100 companies own 834,000 BTC. A position in the top 100 or top 10 may be more beneficial for stock prices, as well as the ability to further expand the BTC treasury. Metaplanet aims to position its US-listed subsidiary in a way that will give the company access to financing, as well as reputation and exposure. The company also aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. A treasury of this size would rival national governments and is one of the most ambitious plans. Other BTC treasury companies in the top 10 had more sporadic purchases and no clear plan of expansion, but Metaplanet aims to gain a similar reputation to Strategy.

2025-06-24T07:49:47,"Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025?","The post Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is entering a defining phase. After undergoing regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical shocks, and cycles of hype and despair. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to offer stability, the spotlight is gradually shifting toward new-generation projects with cutting-edge infrastructure and real-world utility. One name that stands out is “SUI”. Founded by former Meta engineers and launched in 2023, SUI has quickly made its presence felt not just for its price action but for its robust technical design. Now trading at $2.85, up over 246% in one year, SUI is poised for a major breakout in the evolving Web3 narrative. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Reliable Safe Havens? In turbulent markets, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to serve as financial bedrocks in the crypto market. As global tensions rise, like the recent military escalations between global powers, investors often seek refuge in these legacy assets. BTC’s finite supply and ETH’s growing utility in DeFi, NFTs, and staking protocols reaffirm their place as long-term value stores. With institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK continuing to expand Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF exposure, the floor for these assets is more solid than ever. Although they may not deliver 10x returns, they are likely to provide relative stability and respectable gains as the broader market matures. Why SUI Could Be 2025’s Breakout Star SUI isn’t just another Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed with scalability, security, and developer flexibility at its core. Using a unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language, it addresses many of the vulnerabilities seen in legacy blockchains. This innovation allows it to support high throughput and low latency, perfect for mass adoption. Launched at $1.4, SUI hit a high of $5.35 within 18 months, solidifying its place among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its daily trading volume has surged by 49.83%, and the RSI indicator, currently at 48.4, suggests a possible bullish reversal as it bounces from the mid-range. Successively, if all goes well, SUI price could eye the $7 mark in 2025. Adding further bullish momentum is NASDAQ’s 21Shares ETF filing for SUI, a move that could drive institutional capital into the ecosystem. While SUI is still young and may face stiff competition from older Layer-1 chains, its growth trajectory, innovation, and institutional signals make it a crypto to watch, and potentially one that could boom in 2025. Curious about Sui’s long-term target? Read our Sui Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is SUI a risky investment in 2025? It carries risks, but its rapid growth, strong fundamentals and adoption reduce uncertainty. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum still be good investments in 2025? Yes, they will remain reliable choices, especially for conservative investors seeking stability. Why is SUI getting ETF interest so early?

2025-06-24T07:38:38,"Crypto Regulations In China 2025","The post Crypto Regulations In China 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News China was among the earliest countries to enthusiastically embrace cryptocurrency. The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties. Previous major crypto regulations in China– Date Law/ Regulation Details September 24, 2021 Crypto trading, mining, and transactions ban Effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin June 2021 Ban on crypto mining Concerns regarding cryptocurrency January 2018 Crackdown on cryptocurrencies Miners shifted operations overseas September 30, 2017 ICO ban ICO, crypto exchanges, trading cease April 1, 2014 Closure of Bitcoin trading PBOC ordered to close bitcoin trading accounts December 5, 2013 Banking restrictions Banks/ payments institutions banned from bitcoin transactions June 2009 Prohibition of virtual currencies To prevent purchasing real-world goods What is the Chinese Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework.

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China’s regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China’s strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It’s highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-china-in-2024/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
