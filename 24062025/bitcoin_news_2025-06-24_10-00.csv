Crypto Market and Meme Coins Return in Full Swing as Trump Announces Iran-Israel Ceasefire June 24, 2025 • 07:53 UTC The 3.5% ($100B+) crypto market cap dump following the US’ attack on Iran on Sunday is ancient history now.

XRP Explodes Above $2 Price as Middle East Conflict Pauses: Can It Reach $2.3 and Higher? June 24, 2025 • 07:22 UTC XRP’s chart shows one of the best climbs no one expected with the current geopolitical climate. A 14% increase from Sunday (when it dropped under $2) and a 9% increase in the last day alone underline the crypto’s potential. The Ripple and SEC settlement and the XRP treasury adoption reaching $1B are partly responsible for this increased investor interest. Another is the 1.5M XRP payments processed in 24 hours, an achievement for the crypto history books. And lastly, $XRPQ (the first Canadian XRP ETF) raised over C$32M three days after launch. It’s no wonder the coin has gained so much momentum recently—all the crypto stars are aligned. As XRP just broke the $2.2 level, are we looking at a continued climb, perhaps to $2.3–$2.4 and beyond? As per CMC, the community is highly bullish on XRP (88% positive community sentiment), and commenters are talking about a strong reversal at play .

If execution matches the mission and press-release hype surrounding the first truly mass-market, bank-issued dollar token, goals, this will massively increase retail adoption of on-chain money.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-presales-live-news-today-latest-opportunities-updates-june-24-2025/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T07:49:47,"Metaplanet to inject up to $5B into its Florida subsidiary","Metaplanet announced its board approved a $5B capitalization of its US-based subsidiary. The new funding will expand the plan to build up Metaplanet’s BTC treasury. Metaplanet, one of the high-profile BTC treasury companies, announced a plan to aggressively capitalize its US-based subsidiary. The new capital injection of up to $5B will aim to expand Metaplanet’s BTC treasury model. The Japanese company announced the additional capitalization as part of its ‘555 million plan’. The funding will be allocated to the Florida-based Metaplanet Treasury Corp. *Notice of Additional Capital Contribution to U.S. Subsidiary* pic.twitter.com/5dWd5Y3s40 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 24, 2025 The expansion of the US subsidiary will allow the company to access markets with deeper liquidity. Currently, Metaplanet found sufficient BTC from Japanese exchanges, using the BitFlyer market. Recently, the company also bought BTC from the wallets of QCP Capital. Metaplanet is also one of the companies with a fully transparent treasury and known cold wallets. Corporate purchases rely on diminishing sources of BTC available through exchanges and OTC desks, and are considered the main factor for the creation of coin scarcity. On a weekly basis, corporate purchases often reach three times the amount of newly mined BTC. The company now holds 11,111 BTC, surpassing its previous plans of buying up to 10K BTC by the end of 2025. The ability to buy more BTC hinged on the rally of the Metaplanet stock price. In the past six months, the shares expanded by 1,250%, peaking at 1,895 JPY (around $13.05). Metaplanet saw one of the biggest rallies among BTC treasury companies, allowing it to accelerate the recent BTC purchases. | Source: Google Finance In the past weeks, Metaplanet has outperformed Strategy (MSTR) with a more relentless climb, allowing for the latest large purchases. However, Metaplanet has only 0.000018 BTC per share, a factor of 100 lower than Strategy. The Japanese company also started out at a later stage, with an average BTC purchase price of $95,869. After the latest BTC purchases, Metaplanet is climbing the ranks of treasury companies, which are becoming even more exclusive. In the past week, Metaplanet added another 1,111 BTC to its reserves, becoming the eight-largest holder and closing in on Tesla, Inc. The latest addition surpassed Strategy’s weekly purchase, which this time shrank to just 245 BTC . Metaplanet aims at an international market presence Metaplanet is making more aggressive moves, aiming for a global presence and a much higher BTC treasury. Currently, small-scale companies are also announcing BTC purchases, with some treasuries as low as 10 BTC. The Japanese company also boosted the Market Vector index of crypto companies, which has been on a non-stop expansion since the lows in April. The requirement for treasuries is now around 21 BTC to join the top 100 buyers. Metaplanet is competing with aggressive acquisitions, where the top 100 companies own 834,000 BTC. A position in the top 100 or top 10 may be more beneficial for stock prices, as well as the ability to further expand the BTC treasury. Metaplanet aims to position its US-listed subsidiary in a way that will give the company access to financing, as well as reputation and exposure. The company also aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. A treasury of this size would rival national governments and is one of the most ambitious plans. Other BTC treasury companies in the top 10 had more sporadic purchases and no clear plan of expansion, but Metaplanet aims to gain a similar reputation to Strategy.

2025-06-24T07:49:47,"Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025?","The post Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is entering a defining phase. After undergoing regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical shocks, and cycles of hype and despair. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to offer stability, the spotlight is gradually shifting toward new-generation projects with cutting-edge infrastructure and real-world utility. One name that stands out is “SUI”. Founded by former Meta engineers and launched in 2023, SUI has quickly made its presence felt not just for its price action but for its robust technical design. Now trading at $2.85, up over 246% in one year, SUI is poised for a major breakout in the evolving Web3 narrative. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Reliable Safe Havens? In turbulent markets, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to serve as financial bedrocks in the crypto market. As global tensions rise, like the recent military escalations between global powers, investors often seek refuge in these legacy assets. BTC’s finite supply and ETH’s growing utility in DeFi, NFTs, and staking protocols reaffirm their place as long-term value stores. With institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK continuing to expand Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF exposure, the floor for these assets is more solid than ever. Although they may not deliver 10x returns, they are likely to provide relative stability and respectable gains as the broader market matures. Why SUI Could Be 2025’s Breakout Star SUI isn’t just another Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed with scalability, security, and developer flexibility at its core. Using a unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language, it addresses many of the vulnerabilities seen in legacy blockchains. This innovation allows it to support high throughput and low latency, perfect for mass adoption. Launched at $1.4, SUI hit a high of $5.35 within 18 months, solidifying its place among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its daily trading volume has surged by 49.83%, and the RSI indicator, currently at 48.4, suggests a possible bullish reversal as it bounces from the mid-range. Successively, if all goes well, SUI price could eye the $7 mark in 2025. Adding further bullish momentum is NASDAQ’s 21Shares ETF filing for SUI, a move that could drive institutional capital into the ecosystem. While SUI is still young and may face stiff competition from older Layer-1 chains, its growth trajectory, innovation, and institutional signals make it a crypto to watch, and potentially one that could boom in 2025. Curious about Sui’s long-term target? Read our Sui Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is SUI a risky investment in 2025? It carries risks, but its rapid growth, strong fundamentals and adoption reduce uncertainty. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum still be good investments in 2025? Yes, they will remain reliable choices, especially for conservative investors seeking stability. Why is SUI getting ETF interest so early? Its innovative architecture and rising ecosystem adoption have caught institutional attention early.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/which-crypto-will-boom-in-2025/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|SUI","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T07:38:38,"Crypto Regulations In China 2025","The post Crypto Regulations In China 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News China was among the earliest countries to enthusiastically embrace cryptocurrency. The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties. Previous major crypto regulations in China– Date Law/ Regulation Details September 24, 2021 Crypto trading, mining, and transactions ban Effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin June 2021 Ban on crypto mining Concerns regarding cryptocurrency January 2018 Crackdown on cryptocurrencies Miners shifted operations overseas September 30, 2017 ICO ban ICO, crypto exchanges, trading cease April 1, 2014 Closure of Bitcoin trading PBOC ordered to close bitcoin trading accounts December 5, 2013 Banking restrictions Banks/ payments institutions banned from bitcoin transactions June 2009 Prohibition of virtual currencies To prevent purchasing real-world goods What is the Chinese Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country’s own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China’s regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China’s strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It’s highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-china-in-2024/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T07:38:33,"Metaplanet Plans to Inject $5B Into U.S. Unit to Accelerate Bitcoin Buying Strategy","Metaplanet's (3350) board of directors has approved a capital injection of up to $5 billion for its U.S. subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury Corp, in a bid to speed up its bitcoin BTC acquisition strategy. The Japanese hotel company set up its Florida-based subsidiary on May 1, aimed at expanding its global bitcoin treasury operations. The contribution is expected to significantly accelerate the implementation of its “555 million plan,” disclosed earlier on June 6, the company said in a statement . Metaplanet’s strategic objective is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, leveraging the deep capital markets and advanced institutional infrastructure in the U.S. to optimize acquisition and management processes. This U.S. expansion aligns with the company’s broader vision to establish a globally integrated treasury model that supports shareholder value, improves treasury yield efficiency and strengthens its leadership in bitcoin capital markets. The funding for this contribution will come from exercising the 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition rights, and all proceeds will be directed toward additional bitcoin purchases. Importantly, there is no change to the previously disclosed intended use of funds. The financial impact on the company’s current fiscal year results is expected to be minimal, but Metaplanet has committed to promptly disclosing any material developments. Shares of the Tokyo-listed Metaplanet, the eighth largest corporate holder of bitcoin with 11,111 BTC, closed 7% lower on Tuesday.

2025-06-24T07:30:11,"Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here’s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow","Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications So far, investors are already looking positively toward July 2025, as there have been rumors of a rate cut. This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November.

2025-06-24T07:26:02,"Schiff introduces the COIN Act to bar the president from crypto","U.S. Senator for California Adam Schiff introduced a bill on Monday titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act. The legislation would bar the president, vice president, and their immediate family members from engaging in crypto-related business ventures while holding office. The bill comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the case of President Donald Trump’s recent involvement in crypto. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Schiff introduces the COIN Act Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 The new legislation mandates that officials disclose any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. According to the bill, violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff also linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings, saying they have raised significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of presidency to enrich himself and his family. Trump and his family have doubled down on their footprint in the crypto space, as his administration has pushed to create a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, including through legislation. “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” – Adam Schiff , U.S. Senator for California. The senator’s proposal also raised eyebrows since he just voted last week in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. Schiff acknowledged in a video posted Monday that Trump’s stablecoin venture was a central piece of the graft going on in the White House. The legislation restricts members of Congress and some executive officials from issuing stablecoins but exempts the president and vice president. Democrats had initially threatened to walk away from the bill at the Republicans’ refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. Due to pressure to push the legislation through, the U.S. officials finally relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, and it passed on June 19. According to the proposal, nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the stablecoin legislation. Democrats propose other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures Democrats have also proposed other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures, including the MEME Act, introduced by Sam Liccardo in the House and Senator Chris Murphy. Representative Maxine Waters also introduced the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none of the legislations are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Last year, Trump and his sons launched a crypto project, World Liberty Financial, which has since released a stablecoin. According to a recent financial disclosure, the President has garnered around $58 million from the venture. That total is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his memecoin launched in January. Trump launched his memecoin (TRUMP) shortly after his inauguration and held a dinner with the top investors last month. His wife, Melania Trump, also launched her memecoin ( MELANIA ) days after Trump launched his token. The President’s involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. In May, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also opened an investigation into Trump’s crypto businesses. Blumenthal revealed that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations would be opening a preliminary inquiry into the launch of the President’s cryptocurrency, along with DeFi platform WLFI and other digital asset interests. Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has raised $2.5 billion to create a Bitcoin reserve and has advanced towards launching several crypto-related financial assets. The SEC approved the filing on June 13, which covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

2025-06-24T07:17:40,"Texas passes SB1498 allowing seizure of digital assets tied to crimes","Texas has passed a law granting law enforcement the authority to seize digital assets, with the measure set to take effect on Sept. 1. On June 20, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1498 , a bipartisan law that gives law enforcement the power to seize digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), NFTs, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrency tied to criminal activity. The bill received full approval and is set to take effect on Sept. 1. Under the new law, digital assets can be seized if they were used in or gained from crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud, theft, organized crime, or human trafficking. Any increase in the value of the seized assets between the time it was obtained and the time it is seized can also be claimed by the state. Law enforcement would be required to move any seized assets tied to these crimes into a secure, offline wallet that can only be accessed by the agency or the state’s attorney. The forfeiture case would be filed in the county where the seizing agency is based.

Lawmakers said SB1498 addresses gaps in current law and is needed as digital assets increasingly play a role in financial crimes. Meanwhile, Arizona is also updating its laws to expand the state’s forfeiture laws to include digital assets. SB1498 arrives alongside SB21, signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott on June 22, making Texas the first state to allocate public funds and create a dedicated framework specifically for holding Bitcoin. Managed separately from the general treasury, the reserve aims to strengthen the state’s financial resilience and serve as a hedge against inflation. Additionally, Texas has become the third state in the US to pass a Bitcoin reserve law, following Arizona and New Hampshire .

Institutional investors poured $1.24B into crypto funds this week, marking ten straight weeks of inflows. With inflation fears cooling and macro conditions stabilizing, crypto appears poised for sustained growth. The cryptocurrency market has staged a recovery after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “complete and total” ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The move, which de-escalates the Israel-Iran conflict, sparked a surge in risk appetite among investors, sending Bitcoin 3% higher to reclaim the key $105,000 level. The market-wide rally began late Monday after President Trump’s announcement on Truth Social was followed by confirmations from senior Iranian officials, according to Reuters . The de-escalation caused a sharp reversal from the risk-off sentiment that had gripped markets. Ceasefire Sparks Broad Market Rally Markets responded swiftly and decisively.

Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, allowing the state to set aside $10 million to buy Bitcoin. Unlike other states that have shown interest in digital assets, Texas is proving its commitment by putting real money on the line. Lone Star State becomes the first in the U.S. to officially fund a Bitcoin treasury $10M Bitcoin Bet Is Now Official The newly signed law directs the state to build a Bitcoin reserve that will be managed independently from the state’s main treasury. The Texas Bitcoin reserve will be managed by the state comptroller with guidance from a three-member crypto advisory committee. Along with direct purchases, the fund may grow through forks, airdrops, profits, or public donations. A detailed public report will be released every two years. This makes Texas stand out from states like Arizona and New Hampshire , which approved similar legislation but never actually funded their crypto reserves. The $10 million may sound small for a state the size of Texas, it’s just 0.0004% of the overall state budget, but crypto experts say it’s a big step forward. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, says this sends a powerful signal that Texas is ready to lead in the future of finance. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold that only Bitcoin currently has. Bitcoin Reserve Gets Extra Legal Protection Alongside Senate Bill 21, Governor Abbott also signed HB 4488. This bill makes sure that the Bitcoin held by the state isn’t accidentally swept into the general budget during financial reshuffling. In other words, Texas wants to keep its Bitcoin stash safe and untouched. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits , This move comes as the Trump administration works on building a national crypto reserve, though the federal version plans to rely on crypto seizures or bond issuance instead of direct funding.

Texas aims to position itself as a crypto-forward state and hedge against fiat currency risks. With Senate Bill 21, the state officially allocated $10M to Bitcoin as a signal of long-term confidence in digital assets and financial innovation. Could Texas start accepting Bitcoin for taxes or state services? Not yet, but this move lays the foundation for such innovations in the future. If this reserve performs well and the legal framework strengthens, Bitcoin payments could become a viable option How does the Texas Bitcoin reserve differ from similar proposals in Arizona and New Hampshire? Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed laws but didn’t allocate actual funds, Texas has put $10 million into its reserve. This shows real financial commitment, making Texas the first state to officially fund and manage a crypto treasury. What’s HB 4488, and how does it protect the Bitcoin reserve? HB 4488 ensures that Texas’s Bitcoin reserve stays separate from the general state budget.

2025-06-24T07:15:31,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction For June 25","After a sharp rebound from the $100,000 region, the Bitcoin price today is trading near $105,400 as bulls attempt to regain control. The recovery follows a high-volume bounce from major demand zones, with momentum indicators pointing toward a potential short-term continuation. However, the price remains capped below a critical resistance band, creating a tight range heading into June 25. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin price action on the daily chart shows BTC moving within a medium-term ascending pitchfork. After breaking below mid-channel support earlier this week, bulls stepped in aggressively at the lower bounds near $100K. This level also aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement zone and prior breakout support. The daily structure remains fragile, as price is now approaching key resistance levels between $106,000 and $108,000. This area overlaps with a Fibonacci pivot and prior rejection zone. Meanwhile, upside targets are visible at $109,150 and $114,890, both significant Fibonacci and pivot cluster zones. On the downside, $102,000 and $100,000 form crucial intraday support levels.

While the BTC price fell to $98,000, ETH and altcoins also experienced significant declines. However, after the news that Iran and Israel reached an agreement, BTC and altcoins turned green, while Santiment issued a volatility warning for some altcoins. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment announced the four altcoins that whales transferred the most to exchanges. Accordingly, Santiment said that significant transfers to exchanges were seen in five altcoins. These include PAX Gold (PAXG), Space ID (ID), Gala (GALA), Aethir (ATH), and Pendle (PENDLE). “PAX Gold, Space ID, Gala, Aethir, and Pendle are among the altcoins that have seen whale transfers of over $1 million to centralized exchanges. Be prepared for volatility, especially when high percentages of a coin’s supply are transferred to a CEX.” Such large altcoin inflows to exchanges are generally interpreted as preparations for sales. It usually signals potential selling pressure and increased volatility, as whales may be preparing to unload their positions. Therefore, whale transfers can increase short-term volatility for these altcoins and affect price action. At this point, investors should also monitor PAX Gold, Space ID, GALA, ATH, and PENDLE, as increased exchange transfers could signal increased selling pressure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T07:05:00,"These 5 Coins Will Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Delivering 15,000% Returns by Market Peak in 2026","June 2025 — Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the twin pillars of the crypto ecosystem, but their scale now limits the kind of exponential returns seen in previous cycles. While they continue to lead institutional adoption and ecosystem development, many investors are eyeing a new wave of high-upside tokens with the potential to 15x, 150x—even 15000%—by the 2026 peak. In this list, we spotlight five standout altcoins—led by Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and including Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui—that are positioned to outperform BTC and ETH over the next 18 months vastly. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Utility at Layer-2 Speed Little Pepe isn’t just a meme—it’s infrastructure for the meme economy. Unlike viral coins scrambling to add utility after launch, LILPEPE was designed as a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme tokens from the outset. Its standout features include sniper bot immunity, zero tax on transactions, and a native token launchpad ( Pepe’s Pump Pad ) that lets anyone deploy a secure meme token with locked liquidity and pre-audited contracts. The presale, now in Stage 3, is experiencing a surge. With more than 67% of tokens sold at the current tier and prices rising incrementally per stage, investors are rushing in before major centralized exchange (CEX) listings go live. Backed by meme veterans with a track record of launching viral tokens, Little Pepe’s roadmap includes: A launch on Uniswap and two major centralized exchanges A $1 billion market cap target A top-100 CEX’s push by year’s end By combining technical innovation with meme-driven virality, LILPEPE could easily outperform traditional tokens. Its current low market entry point could result in four—to five-digit percentage returns in the coming cycle. Solana (SOL): Still a Contender, Despite a Summer Lull Solana has faced headwinds recently. Following a double-digit drop over the past month, trading volumes have also slid by over 16% in the last 24 hours alone. Investor confidence has waned, with price movement stagnating in a tight, sideways range that many view as a symbol of broader altcoin fatigue. However, history shows that Solana’s quiet periods often precede periods of aggressive growth. In past cycles, periods of low volatility and declining interest created accumulation zones that set up multi-month bull runs. The key lies in Solana’s underlying fundamentals: fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a massive NFT and DeFi ecosystem that remains unmatched among L1 competitors. While the $200 mark for Solana seems unattainable, once the network activity picks up and the market climate improves, Solana can recover some of the lost ground. Analysts say breakout potential remains within reach as innovations continue and on-chain activities pick up. Due to its solid developer community and growing institutional appeal, Solana remains a high-beta wager with massive growth potential, especially for those who buy in during consolidation periods. Dogecoin (DOGE): Compression Before Explosion? Dogecoin nears breakout as symmetrical triangle tightens, signaling potential major move ahead. Recently, the coin has been tested for its support and resistance levels multiple times. Price recovery attempts have been met with sell pressure, but support has remained firm, indicating accumulation beneath the surface. Analysts suggest that the current pattern could resolve with a 60% move in either direction, with macroeconomic developments—such as Federal Reserve announcements—acting as a likely trigger. Though the breakout direction isn’t guaranteed, the setup is hard to ignore. With Elon Musk’s continued support and DOGE’s integration into several mainstream platforms, even a moderate rally could reignite speculative interest. In a euphoric market, DOGE could once again set its sights on the elusive $1 mark, making now a strategic moment for entry. Cardano (ADA): ETF Approval Bets Fuel Institutional Interest Cardano’s price has been under pressure, weighed down by recent market sell-offs and whale liquidations. Yet underneath the bearish surface lies one of the most powerful potential catalysts of the next 12 months: ETF approval odds hitting all-time highs. Analysts at Bloomberg now assign a 79% probability to a spot Cardano ETF being approved in the U.S.—a significant shift from earlier this year, when odds hovered below 70%. The SEC’s interactions with big asset managers and new interest from crypto institutions fuel this newfound excitement. While some whales have let go of their holdings throughout this recent turbulent period, on-chain data shows that mid-tier investors continue to buy, demonstrating conviction that growth will occur over time and that inflows triggered by ETFs will add fuel to the fire. Although ADA is not exhibiting significant price action, factors such as fundamentals, regulatory tailwinds, and the level of developer engagement suggest the possibility of a multi-phase recovery rally when risk appetite returns. Should the ETF case play out in 2025, Cardano could undergo a drastic pivot, offering rewards that surpass those of other slow-moving assets. Sui (SUI): Oversold but Structurally Promising Sui has been under intense selling pressure in both spot and derivatives markets. Open Interest has cratered by over 40% since late May, while taker sell volume outpaces buys by a wide margin, highlighting weak sentiment and capital flight from leveraged positions. Yet, this capitulation phase might be exactly what SUI needs. The RSI indicates a bullish divergence scenario, as the price forms higher lows while testing support. MACD flattening hints downtrend is weakening; SUI eyes reversal if $3 resistance gets tested. A break of that resistance could lead to recovery toward monthly highs and possibly reestablish momentum toward all-time levels. Given its strong infrastructure backing and developer interest, a turnaround here could signal the beginning of a larger move. For contrarian investors, SUI may offer one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the current altcoin landscape. Final Word: Don’t Just Watch Bitcoin—Beat It Real 2026 gains lie in undervalued, high-utility altcoins with momentum. Little Pepe leads this list as the most explosive narrative play of the year, while Solana, DOGE, Cardano, and Sui offer fundamentally solid setups with technical breakout potential. In a cycle where infrastructure meets meme culture and regulation meets DeFi, this is the moment to look beyond the giants—and position yourself before the wave hits.

2025-06-24T07:04:29,"Crypto Analyst Unveils ‘Biggest Area’ of Accumulation for Bitcoin, Says BTC Going Much Higher in Coming Years","An analyst known for calling the November 2021 crypto bull cycle top says he’s looking to heavily accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ) if it drops below $100,000. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 867,700 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Bitcoin, and he thinks dips below the six-figure price level are golden opportunities to stack more BTC. “I bought 25 BTC to start to scale in. Spot, of course. But I think the biggest area I want to buy is around $94,000 if given, where I would go pretty heavy. I think in the next few years we are going much, much higher regardless. In the short term, it’s hard to say. The chart looks not ideal. I see that area as current value, however. Of course, I was hoping for us to see $120,000+ at the recent highs. It just didn’t happen. We don’t always get what we want.” Source: Pentoshi/X While the trader thinks that Bitcoin will soar over a long arc of time, he points out that macro uncertainties and geopolitical tensions could drive BTC to lower levels in the short term. “I don’t suggest following me into this at all, there’s a TON of uncertainty. And we likely do go lower. My time frames likely differ from yours. I mostly focus on broader, higher time frames than the minute-to-minute stuff. I would say odds are higher we do go lower for those looking to actually knife catch.” As for the catalyst that will fuel Bitcoin’s ascent in the coming years, Pentoshi says the debasement of the US dollar will drive people to dump their fiat currency in favor of BTC.

2025-06-24T07:00:30,"$589 XRP Coded Price Target: This Seems Coded In Bitcoin Before XRP: Details","In a recent tweet accompanied by a video, crypto commentator NotFinancialAdvice presented a theory suggesting that the number 589 (believed to be the potential XRP price) may have been intentionally embedded in Bitcoin’s history before being popularly associated with XRP. The tweet reads , “Was 589 coded into Bitcoin before XRP?!” and expands into a detailed commentary connecting dates, crypto protocols, and regulatory events. The creator refers to a specific image from a CNBC segment, where a $100 bill showing the serial number ending in “589” appears beneath a Bitcoin, calling it “one of the craziest 589s hidden in plain sight” and labeling the moment as intentional rather than coincidental. He credits the find to the account XRPdrops but says the implications go beyond XRP. In the video, he questions why the number 589 appears beneath a Bitcoin instead of XRP in the visual and suggests that the alignment between Bitcoin and XRP could point to a shared design or broader coordinated vision. According to the creator, “that was intentional,” and he adds, “that is an impossible coincidence.” Was 589 coded into Bitcoin before XRP?! pic.twitter.com/VvjvRb1nV7 — NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) June 23, 2025 Proposed Complementarity Between Bitcoin and XRP The video further expands on the theory by suggesting that Bitcoin and XRP may have complementary roles within a broader monetary architecture. The creator references Bitcoin’s proof-of-work design, claiming it creates “real value” through energy expenditure, while XRP’s green consensus protocol could serve as the mechanism to transmit that value efficiently. He also compares the respective branding aesthetics, proposing that the colors of the Bitcoin and Ripple logos were chosen to reflect ionized liquid gold and silver. In his interpretation, Bitcoin represents a gold-like store of value, and XRP represents a silver-like utility in payments. He also asserts that these characteristics shared a purposeful link, stating that both cryptocurrencies might have originated from the same ideological or even organizational source. He implies that this origin has not been made public but can be deduced through symbolic and factual alignment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Dates and the “589” Connection The video goes further by highlighting specific dates and timelines. One of the central observations is that the first time the Bitcoin source code was publicly posted on a forum was on May 8, 2009—numerically represented as 5/8/09. He argues that this date not only fits the now-famous 589 motif but may have been deliberately chosen. The theory becomes more intricate as he links this date to an SEC file released the same day—SEC release number 34-59895. He states that this document established a legal and structural framework that would eventually support the approval of digital asset products, including Bitcoin ETFs. In another connection, the commentator notes that Brad Garlinghouse was named CEO of Ripple five years, eight months, and nine days after Satoshi Nakamoto sent his final known email on April 23, 2011. He considers this timing to be more than coincidental and potentially indicative of a larger orchestrated effort behind the scenes. According to NotFinancialAdvice, these time-based and numerical correlations are not isolated phenomena. He believes they indicate that the concept of 589 may have been embedded into the crypto space from the beginning, possibly by a group of cryptographers who designed both Bitcoin and XRP as part of a coordinated, long-term vision. He emphasizes that if these connections are intentional, they demonstrate how early decisions shaped the regulatory and technological environment in which cryptocurrencies now operate.

2025-06-24T06:48:14,"$4B Hong Kong Family Office Enters Crypto — How Big is the Bet?","VMS Group, a Hong Kong multifamily offices with deep roots in private equity, is making its first push into digital assets as clearer regulations and institutional momentum pull traditional investors into the crypto space. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the firm, which manages nearly $4b for some of the city’s wealthiest families, plans to allocate up to $10m to Re7 Capital, a London-based hedge fund focused on decentralized finance strategies. VMS managing partner Elton Cheung said the move reflects a shift in how the firm approaches liquidity and diversification. Founded two decades ago, the Hong Kong firm has historically focused on private equity and long-term bets across sectors such as property, pharmaceuticals and technology. But with companies staying private longer and exits becoming harder to time, the firm is now leaning into more liquid strategies, including digital assets. VMS Chooses Hedged Approach to Crypto Over Direct Token Holdings “We thought this was the right time because of growing demand and because we see clearer legislative and government support from various jurisdictions, as well as large institutional support and endorsement,” Cheung told Bloomberg. He did not disclose specific clients. Instead of buying volatile tokens like Bitcoin , VMS chose to work with Re7, which offers a market-neutral strategy. The fund earns yield by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges and lending stablecoins, while hedging to reduce price swings. That approach aligns more closely with the risk frameworks of legacy family offices that are seeking exposure without speculative downside. “The reason investors keep coming back to crypto is the asymmetry of risk and return,” said Re7 founder Evgeny Gokhberg. “Typically, people think about asymmetry in crypto as ‘lose it all or make a 100x.’ That’s rarely a fit for a serious allocator with a reputation to lose.” Re7, founded in 2021, claims to have consistently delivered double-digit returns, though it did not disclose exact figures. Next-Gen Wealth Influences Hong Kong Family Office’s Shift Toward Broader Digital Asset Adoption VMS’ crypto strategy goes beyond hedge fund exposure. Zhi Li, who joined the firm in December to lead digital asset investments from London, said the team is studying broader applications, including blockchain payments and infrastructure. One current area of interest is integrating crypto-based transactions at a real estate development the firm operates in Vietnam. “There is very strong institutional and family interest in getting regulated digital asset exposure,” said Li. “We have seen the younger generation of families wanting to do something different.” As family offices evolve to serve new wealth dynamics and generational preferences, VMS’s entry into crypto reflects a broader shift. Once reluctant, legacy capital is now stepping into digital assets, not for hype, but for structure, yield and strategic positioning.

He was reportedly paid thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for his efforts. According to a recent news reports by i24 and Arutz Sheva, Israeli authorities claimed that the suspect, a man named Or Beilin, was paid thousands of dollars in crypto to conduct espionage on Israeli public officials and political activities. Following his handler’s instructions, the Israeli man was assigned to spy on public officials by taking photographs of their homes in secret, documenting government military installations and report on political spray-painted graffiti. The 27-year-old was arrested on June 24 by the Israeli police and the Shin Bet security service. The police raided his home and seized the culprit’s computer and other digital equipment used to receive crypto payments and communicate with Iranian contacts. He has been temporarily detained under suspicion as authorities continue to carry out more investigations into the matter.

Despite alarming headlines, equities like the S&P and NASDAQ are climbing, oil prices are falling, and crypto sentiment is far from collapsing. Moreover, President Trump’s peace-leaning X post has added calm to the chaos. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst VirtualBacon offers a refreshing perspective: “This is not a time to sell in fear, but a time to buy with conviction”. Intriguing enough? let’s dive into the analysis for more details. Bitcoin Holds Steady in Bullish Territory? The analyst highlights that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish above $85k, supported by its 50-week SMA. With the ideal entry between $94k and $95k, aligned with the 20-week SMA, he believes that the market weakness here is viewed as a gift, not a threat. A potential double-top pattern is forming, and if the neckline breaks, it could deliver the long-awaited entry point.

2025-06-24T06:30:36,"Historic Ripple Image Suggests XRP is the “Final Product” of Bitcoin Beta Test","Crypto influencer Amelie posted a tweet drawing attention to an old promotional image of Ripple from its early development phase. The tweet, captioned “WOW! ‘RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.’ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT. HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH,” was accompanied by a photo of an early Ripple conference booth. In the image, a banner describes Ripple as “the world’s first open payment network” and highlights features such as distributed exchanges, cross-currency payments, and liquidity improvements. One of the key takeaways from the banner is the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners,” which Amelie used as a central element in her statement. The image likely dates back to Ripple’s earliest promotional stages, when the team was presenting its vision to the broader blockchain and developer community. It prominently features Arthur Britto and David Schwartz’s early positioning of Ripple as a technologically advanced alternative to Bitcoin’s initial shortcomings in payment scalability and interoperability. WOW! „RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.“ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH. pic.twitter.com/JH44HBzUhI — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 22, 2025 Context Behind “Built by Bitcoiners” Amelie’s use of the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners” points to the historical reality that some of Ripple’s early contributors had been involved in Bitcoin or had studied its limitations closely. Ripple’s creators sought to improve on what they considered inefficiencies in Bitcoin’s architecture, especially around transaction throughput, energy consumption, and lack of native support for multiple currencies. Ripple’s consensus protocol, which differs significantly from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work model , was introduced to address these issues directly. The tweet suggests that Bitcoin functioned as a “beta test,” while XRP represents a more refined, scalable iteration. This perspective is controversial, but Amelie presents it as a factual progression rather than a speculative opinion. The tone of her message is definitive, asserting XRP’s role as the superior technological evolution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions to the Tweet Amelie’s tweet received responses from other users on the X platform. One user, posting under the handle Crypto, reacted with a rhetorical question: “Is the failure worth 100,000 dollars? Ha ha ha,” seemingly mocking Bitcoin’s high valuation in the context of its limitations. Another user named James echoed Amelie’s position, stating , “I agree XRP is the better vision of Bitcoin.” These replies reflect contrasting interpretations of Bitcoin’s value proposition relative to XRP’s utility and network design. Significance of the Image in the Broader XRP Narrative The promotional image shared in Amelie’s tweet serves as a reminder of Ripple’s original messaging strategy and technological goals. Descriptions on the banner, such as “More Merchants,” “Increased Liquidity & Utility,” and “Shared Principles, Shared Dream” reflect the ambition to build a more adaptable and enterprise-friendly system than Bitcoin. The visual reinforcement of Ripple’s origins and ethos, alongside Amelie’s labeling of Bitcoin as a prototype, adds context to the longstanding debate about which blockchain projects are best suited for institutional and cross-border applications . The image and accompanying statement also illustrate how the early Ripple team sought legitimacy by building on Bitcoin’s foundation while simultaneously identifying areas for improvement.

2025-06-24T06:30:18,"Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins?","The post Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising after the conflict between Iran & Israel approached a ceasefire situation. Bitcoin price surged from the lows below $100K and marked a daily high above $106K, which elevated the market capitalization above $3.24 trillion. With this, the market sentiments also surged from fear to neutral, signaling the growing confidence among the market participants. Top Cryptos Recover After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement As the war situation escalated, Bitcoin and the other cryptos faced a huge sell-off with the uncertainty hovering over the markets. The global financial markets also faced the heat, but soon after US President Trump announced a ceasefire between the nations, the markets recovered. In a blog post on Truth Social, Trump announced that Iran and Israel have agreed to a full ceasefire, potentially ending the ‘12-day war. With this, top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and a few more rebounded, while several other categories also reacted positively. Meanwhile, the top gainers included SEI, which surged by more than 30% with a huge rise in volume of over 180%. On the other hand, the memecoins attracted double-digit gains; SPX6900 surged by over 30%, followed by Mog Coin by over 26%, Brett by over 20%, and dogwifhat by over 22%. Meanwhile, the top memecoins, Dogecoin & Shiba Inu, are also preparing for a strong rebound that may elevate the levels within the bullish pattern. AI, RWA & DePIN Space Also Thrive The AI space has gained immense attention in recent times, with the tokens outperforming the top cadre tokens. However, the trader’s interest focused back on the top tokens, which kept the AI tokens under tight consolidation. Bittensor price surged by over 16%, followed by Render by over 15% and Livepeer & Theta Network by over 12% each. On the other hand, the crypto ETFs also saw a positive netflow, as the institutions accumulated over $327 million worth of BTC and over $100.7 million worth of Ethereum. Meanwhile, the Open interest continues to descend, suggesting the traders are opting out of their positions, which does not support the bullish narrative. Will the Crypto Market Continue to Rise? The crypto market has experienced notable relief driven by external factors; however, the significant sell-off was also caused by a similar factor. This suggests the markets have risen above the pure demand and supply tactics and have a huge influence on the goings-on in the outside world. Hence, any further escalation or any announcement may increase the uncertainty, which may further result in a fresh breakdown. Hence, the market participants are expected to remain highly vigilant about the upcoming price action.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-why-the-crypto-market-is-up-today-is-this-a-bullish-signal-for-bitcoin-other-altcoins/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MOG","Price Analysis|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T06:26:44,"Democrats unveil COIN Act to block Trump and public officials from profiting off crypto","Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation that seeks to block U.S. public officials, including the President, from profiting off digital assets during and after their time in office. Dubbed the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure, or COIN, Act, the legislation came in response to concerns over President Donald Trump’s financial ties to cryptocurrency ventures. The bill was introduced by Senator Adam Schiff and co-sponsored by nine other Democratic lawmakers, following reports that Trump earned $57.4 million in 2024 through World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform linked to his family. Schiff said the president’s digital asset activities have raised serious ethical and constitutional concerns, pointing to what he described as Trump’s use of public office for personal financial gain. The COIN Act has been tailored to prevent what its sponsors call the “financial exploitation of digital assets” by elected officials and their immediate families. According to the text of the COIN Act, the legislation would prohibit current and former public officials, including the president, vice president, members of Congress, and high-ranking executive officials, from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets such as meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. This restriction would apply for 180 days prior to taking office and continue for two years after leaving office. Immediate family members would also be subject to the same rules. Further, the bill would amend the Ethics in Government Act to require digital assets to be included in financial disclosures and transaction reports. It also proposes codifying that holding or trading crypto qualifies as a financial interest under conflict of interest laws, requiring officials to recuse themselves from related decisions. Additionally, the legislation would require stablecoin issuers to certify quarterly that no public official is profiting from the issuance of their tokens in order to receive regulatory approval. You might also like: Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire A separate provision calls for the Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress within 360 days, offering recommendations on how to update federal ethics laws as crypto oversight frameworks develop. Pressure to introduce such guardrails has been building for months, driven largely by Democratic lawmakers alarmed by Trump’s expanding crypto portfolio. Earlier this year, Rep. Maxine Waters accused Trump of using his memecoin, $TRUMP, to enrich himself while defrauding investors. In April, Waters raised alarms over World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, warning that the token could become a tool for foreign actors to channel funds to the president. She has also condemned Trump’s private gala for top $TRUMP memecoin holders, calling it a “pay-to-play scheme” that blurred the line between campaign fundraising and political favour-trading. These concerns have already translated into multiple Democratic-led legislative efforts. Waters and other lawmakers have backed bills such as the MEME Act , led by Rep. Sam Liccardo, and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, both aimed at barring public officials and their families from owning or promoting digital assets while in office. Despite repeated objections, Trump has continued to expand his footprint in the digital asset sector. His family has backed multiple crypto ventures, including stablecoins and a reported stake in a Bitcoin mining project. Blockchain data has linked prominent crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , to large holdings of Trump-affiliated tokens.

According to a June 24 disclosure , the Tokyo-based firm said the new funding will accelerate the next phase of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) acquisition campaign, including the implementation of its “555 Million Plan” revealed earlier this month. The funds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, supporting Metaplanet’s goal of acquiring 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, or 1% of the capped supply. Metaplanet Treasury Corp, established in Florida in May 2025, serves as the company’s operational hub for U.S.-based treasury activity. The firm claims that the U.S. market’s institutional infrastructure, deep liquidity, and transparent regulations make it an excellent place to execute. Miami in particular was picked due to its pro-Bitcoin stance and growing reputation as a digital asset hub. This $5 billion capital contribution is expected to be funded through the exercise of newly issued stock acquisition rights. While Metaplanet emphasized there would be no change to the previously disclosed use of proceeds, it noted that any material financial impact would be disclosed in due course.

The company has become one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world and has quickly grown its Bitcoin treasury by issuing convertible bonds and equity. It is now the eighth-largest holder globally, surpassing firms such as Coinbase and Hut 8. So far this year, Metaplanet’s stock has increased by more than 300%. Analysts have, however, noted that there is an increasing premium built into the price of its shares. Some estimates place the price of Bitcoin at between $596,000 and $759,000 per coin, which is significantly higher than current market rates. This premium raises questions regarding sustainability and dilution risk, but it also reflects investors’ desire for indirect Bitcoin exposure through equity markets.

2025-06-24T06:11:24,"Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits","The post Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a bold move to separate politics from digital profits, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill, the COIN Act, that would stop the President, Vice President, and their immediate families from making money through crypto while holding office. And yes, this seems to take aim straight at Donald Trump’s growing crypto ventures . What Is the COIN Act? Officially called the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, the bill proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or promoting any kind of digital asset. This includes meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins, which have become popular ways for public figures to build wealth. Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 If passed, it would prevent not only the president and vice president, but also members of Congress and senior executive officials from endorsing or sponsoring any kind of digital asset project. Why Now? Schiff Points to Trump’s Crypto Profits This legislation is a direct response to Donald Trump’s growing presence in the crypto market. In 2024 alone, Trump reportedly earned over $57 million from token sales and crypto-related ventures. He’s also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs — all of which raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schiff argues that allowing presidents to profit from these markets while in office could blur ethical lines and compromise decision-making. What the Bill Would Do The COIN Act would cover not just the president but also senior executive officials and members of Congress, including their immediate families. Key features include: A ban on creating or promoting crypto assets Mandatory disclosure for digital asset sales over $1,000 Penalties for violations: profits forfeited and up to 5 years in prison .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement , Schiff’s Change of Heart? Interestingly, Schiff supported the GENIUS Act just last week—a bill aimed at setting rules for stablecoins but which left out restrictions for presidents and vice presidents. Now, Schiff seems to be correcting that omission with the COIN Act. So far, nine Senate Democrats have backed the bill. Trump’s Crypto Rise Continues Despite the political pushback, Trump’s crypto activity shows no signs of slowing. He’s involved in everything from Bitcoin mining to launching memecoins and ETFs. His company, TMTG, recently gained SEC approval tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. With 2025 shaping up to be even bigger for crypto and politics, Schiff’s COIN Act could become a major turning point—if it can pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Answers","The Norwegian government is preparing to take a new step towards cryptocurrency mining facilities, which are notable for their high energy consumption. Norway’s Labor government plans to temporarily ban the construction of new crypto mining data centers that use energy-intensive “proof-of-work” systems, according to Reuters. Proof-of-work systems are a key part of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, and are used to secure the network. If approved, the ban is expected to come into effect in the fall of 2025. The government's main goal is to preserve the country's electricity capacity for more efficient and productive sectors. “Cryptocurrency mining consumes a lot of energy and contributes little in terms of employment or income to local communities,” Norwegian Minister of Digitalization Karianne Tung said in a statement. Tung also noted that this move is a clear indication of the government’s intention to limit cryptocurrency mining in Norway as much as possible. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Announces Both an Airdrop and Listing Norway has long been a favorite of bitcoin miners looking for low-cost, clean energy thanks to its abundant renewable hydropower. Companies like Kryptovault, near Oslo, operate data centers that consume up to 40 MW of power and recycle the heat to dry wood or heat buildings. But despite the renewable energy infrastructure, the need for continuous and high-capacity energy from these mining facilities is increasingly considered by regulators as a waste of resources that should be directed to more efficient areas such as industry, heating or artificial intelligence data processing. However, Norway only has a proportional impact of 0.74% in terms of hashrate, the measure of Bitcoin mining, and is ranked as the 11th most mined country. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T06:00:03,"This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market’s Next True ‘Pivot,’ Says Glassnode","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted the $97,000 to $98,000 zone as an important one for Bitcoin. Here’s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss When the mood in the market is bullish, holders can react to retests of their cost basis from above by buying more. They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a ‘dip.’ The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency’s supply is concentrated, it doesn’t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode’s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices. Finally, there are the Loss Sellers (red) and Profit Takers (yellow), who correspond to investors exiting at a loss and profit, respectively. During the past couple of weeks, the former cohort has seen an increase of 29%, a sign that weak hands have been capitulating. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy That said, the analytics firm has noted, “Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses – others are actively lowering their cost basis.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,900, down more than 4% in the last seven days.

2025-06-24T06:00:02,"Bitcoin Could Spike to $120K, Here Are 4 Factors Boosting the Case for a BTC Bull Run","Multiple analysts have repeatedly pointed to $120,000 as bitcoin's BTC price target this year. Recent developments have strengthened that bullish case, driven by four key factors: the spot price, central bank policy, energy market trend, and technical setup. Let's take a look at those in detail. BTC's love affair with $100K Recently, a crypto trader said that the best marketing for any asset is its price, highlighting an idea which is similar to legendary trader George Soros' theory of reflexivity. Soros explained that market perceptions and prices create a feedback loop – higher prices attract more buyers, which in turn drive prices higher, often far beyond what fundamentals suggest. In this context, bitcoin's resilience, marked by prices holding largely above $100,000 through the Iran-Israel conflict and the U.S. airstrike on Iran, is its strongest appeal. The steadfastness indicates underlying strength, which could reassure holders while attracting new buyers, potentially fueling the next leg higher in prices. Moreover, brief dips below $100,000 seen in the past 48 hours saw investors step in with bids, revealing the ""buy the dip mentality."" ""We are seeing exchange outflows, so it is likely that people, regardless of being retail or institutions, are buying the dip. Generally, when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tend to be heavy short-term dips, which later rebound depending on the severity and how the situation is communicated. So far, I'd say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here,"" Nicolai Soendergaard, research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an email Monday. Meanwhile, data tracked by Glassnode shows weak hands began selling on June 10, while conviction buyers resorted to bargain hunting. ""Since June 10, BTC investors classified as Loss Sellers rose 29% (from $74K to $95.6K), showing growing pressure on weak hands. But Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn’t collapsing. Some are cutting losses - others are actively lowering their cost basis,"" Glassnode said on X. Trump seems to have found his doves Liquidity easing, represented by Fed rate cuts and other measures, typically bodes well for stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some Fed officials are warming up to the idea of a potential rate cut in July, which contradicts Chairman Jerome Powell's data-dependent stance. ""Trump seems to have found his doves,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst and Managing Editor, Adam Button wrote on Monda y after Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, a hawk, said the central bank should cut rates in July. Hawks are those who prefer tighter monetary policy and higher rates to temper inflation. Doves are policymakers preferring lower rates to support growth. Bowman said that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer and could be smaller than initially expected, adding that she would support lowering the interest rate next month, assuming inflation pressures remain contained. Fed Governor Christopher Waller voiced a similar opinion Friday, favoring a rate cut in July. ""Now, maybe it's just a coincidence that two former hawks who are also Republicans are suddenly doves, but it's starting to look like a MAGA takeover of the Fed. And if there's one thing [President Donald] Trump has been consistent about through his entire career (and it might only be one single thing), it's that he likes low interest rates,"" Button wrote. Chairman Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony to the U.S. Congress is due on Tuesday. Powell is likely to reiterate the Fed's independence and data-dependent stance while potentially being grilled by Republicans for keeping rates elevated. Oil slide Never before has the crowd been so wrong on crude oil. On Sunday, the consensus was that the U.S. military strikes on Iran and Tehran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz would send oil prices skywards. But on Monday, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic crashed. The slide is good news for central banks fearing the second-order effects of the oil price spike seen late last week, and those expecting rate cuts. The second-order effects typically include increased transportation expenses, higher prices for goods reliant on oil-derived products, and potential wages, all leading to an overall increase in inflation. ""So much for the fear of second order effects of Oil that Central Bankers proclaim. Crude oil down 6.5% on the day and 15.41% YoY..that’s deflation,"" James E. Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington Atlus, said on X . Bullish technical setup Momentum indicators – key moving averages – are once again aligned bullishly. The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) has just crossed above the 200-day SMA, weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs produced a bullish golden crossover. The result is that the three widely-tracked averages are stacked one above the other in a classic upward-sloping bullish momentum formation. A similar configuration emerged in November last year and remained intact throughout the entire rally from $70,000 to $100,000.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/bitcoin-could-spike-to-usd120k-here-are-4-factors-boosting-the-case-for-a-btc-bull-run,"BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Per the official announcement , ProCap Financial will hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It will offer services including trading, lending and capital markets, all denominated in Bitcoin. Further, the $750 million funding includes $235 million in convertible debt, with the remaining amount comprising equity. “It is time to get to work,” said podcast host Pompliano. In a reply to Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, he said, “Your idea is spreading globally as people realize the value of Bitcoin.” Indeed, inspired by Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which currently holds 592,345, after adding 245 Bitcoins on Monday , several public companies are turning into Bitcoin proxies. Intersection of Bitcoin and Traditional Finance However, according to Pompliano, ProCap is pushing beyond that model. He said that the company would build a financial services platform on top of it, besides accumulating Bitcoin. “Our objective is to develop a platform that will not only acquire bitcoin for our balance sheet, but will also implement risk-mitigated solutions to generate revenue and profits from our bitcoin holdings,” he said. Additionally, equity investors will have immediate exposure from day one, the announcement added. “ProCap Financial aims to become the leading financial services firm at the intersection of bitcoin and traditional finance.” Pompliano told CNBC that the goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution, which resonates very differently with capital allocators.

Crypto Market Rebound on Ceasefire and Fed Bets The sudden recovery wasn’t just about peace talks. Traders are now betting on U.S. interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool showing a 53% chance that rates could fall to 3.75% or lower by November. That’s good news for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on looser monetary policy. Despite the recent $193 million in long liquidations, Bitcoin’s open interest remains robust at $68 billion.

The proposed ETF would allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, pending SEC approval. Combined with its $2.3 billion in fresh capital and crypto ambitions, the company’s moves are adding to the overall bullish tone in the market. Bitcoin Price : $110K in Sight? With institutional flows strong, geopolitical fears easing, and Trump’s ETF push catching eyes, the road to $110,000 might not be far off. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next move. Bitcoin’s rally got a major push after Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy dropped a massive $1 billion into BTC. Moreover, this rebound has sparked fresh momentum across the altcoin market too, lifting coins like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Polkadot, and even Pi Network. The market saw it as a strong signal, since big players are doubling down on Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Crypto market reacted sharply to the news of military operations against Iran’s nuclear sites. Bitcoin dropped below $103,000, and major altcoins fell over 9% in 24 hours. The sell-off was mainly due to increased risk aversion, fears of rising oil prices, and concerns that inflation might prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates. Liquidations surged by 38%, exceeding $682 million. Is this a good buying opportunity, or should I wait for more stability? Some users see this as a buying opportunity, especially for those who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. One commenter noted that Bitcoin often drops during geopolitical tensions but tends to bounce back harder than traditional markets. However, others warn that volatility could continue if tensions escalate, so caution is advise What are people doing with their crypto during the crisis? Some are moving funds into cold storage or shifting from high-risk altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are seen as more resilient. Others are taking profits or waiting for further dips before re-entering the market. Will the market recover quickly now that there’s a ceasefire? Sentiment is turning positive after the ceasefire announcement. Bitcoin rebounded above $106,000, and Ethereum surged 9%. Many expect further recovery, especially with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and continued institutional inflows. However, volatility remains high, and some users are still cautious about re-entering the market",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-bitcoin-price-bounce-back-after-trumps-ceasefire-announcement/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T05:35:10,"Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire","The cryptocurrency market rallied on Tuesday, June 24, following news of a potential truce between Israel and Iran, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. According to a June 24 report by Reuters, Trump said both countries had agreed to end hostilities after a 12-day conflict, though Israel has yet to confirm the agreement, and missiles were reportedly launched from Iran early Tuesday. Markets reacted swiftly. After suffering losses over the weekend due to concerns about a wider conflict in the Middle East, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased 2.4% to $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed 3.7% to $105,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) surged 7% to $2,396. Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) also posted strong gains of 7% and 6%, respectively. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 18 points to 65, marking a return to “Greed” territory. Other market indicators suggest improving sentiment. Data from Coinglass shows the average relative strength index across the market rose to 58, a neutral level. Open interest rose by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped to $481 million, down 24% from the previous day. You might also like: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness Markets had turned lower just two days earlier when U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites sparked fears of prolonged conflict and economic disruption. Bitcoin fell nearly 4% to $98,615 at the time, with Ethereum and Solana dropping up to 10%. The attack also led to nearly $1 billion in crypto long- liquidations and a $40 billion loss in total market capitalization. Traders now appear cautiously optimistic. Trump claimed the ceasefire was brokered in coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and mediated through Qatari and U.S. diplomatic channels. While Iranian officials suggested a willingness to pause attacks if Israel halted further aggression, they stopped short of a full commitment. In traditional markets, the ceasefire news also boosted sentiment. After-hours trading saw a 0.4% increase in S&P 500 futures, while oil prices fell from recent highs as concerns about disruptions to Gulf shipping routes subsided. Crypto markets seem to be pricing in a de-escalation for the time being, but traders are still on the lookout for any new developments. The rally might depend on whether the ceasefire holds in the days ahead, as geopolitical risk is still high and neither party has officially confirmed a ceasefire.

2025-06-24T05:33:37,"Sequans Joins Corporate Bitcoin Rush With $384M Funding Plan","After partnering with Swan Bitcoin for treasury management, Sequans now aligns itself with firms like Metaplanet and Nakamoto Holdings, which have aggressively increased their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet bought another 1,111 BTC this week, boosting its total to 11,111 and bringing it within reach of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The corporate Bitcoin adoption trend is gaining global momentum, with firms in Norway, France, and South Korea also jumping in. Meanwhile, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, has dubbed this trend “the new alt season,” and encouraged speculators to shift funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of Bitcoin-holding companies. He believes this wave is a precursor to hyperbitcoinization and a potential $200 trillion Bitcoin market. Despite criticisms from traditional firms like Meta and Microsoft, the enthusiasm surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasuries suggests that there is a transformative shift in how companies view asset diversification and long-term value preservation. Sequans Pushes Into Bitcoin Sequans Communications announced a bold move to raise $384 million to establish a strategic Bitcoin treasury, joining a growing wave of companies betting on Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The IoT semiconductor and module developer plans to raise approximately $195 million through an equity issuance and $189 million via convertible debentures, which could later be converted into company shares. To support this initiative, Sequans is partnering with Swan Bitcoin, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin treasury management. Announcement from Sequans The company's CEO, Georges Karam, explained the long-term investment thesis behind the decision, and called Bitcoin a ”premier asset.” This aligns Sequans with the rising trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasuries with Bitcoin holdings. Just in the past few days, firms like Nakamoto Holdings and Metaplanet expanded their Bitcoin reserves. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that over 240 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, which is almost double from several weeks ago. Collectively, these firms control roughly 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) However, the strategy is not without its critics. Major corporations like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft steered clear of Bitcoin treasury allocations, due to its notorious volatility and the still changing regulatory landscape. For these firms, preserving capital is a priority, and the risk profile of Bitcoin doesn't align with more traditional treasury management objectives. Despite these concerns, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is still a benchmark in the corporate Bitcoin landscape. With a stash of 592,345 BTC valued at over $60 billion, the company continues to lead in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, often leveraging convertible debt to fund its acquisitions. Now that Sequans joined the ranks of Bitcoin-holding companies, the trend of corporate adoption could reshape how institutions approach treasury diversification. Metaplanet Buys 1,111 More BTC Metaplanet, which is Japan’s leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, also announced on Monday that it bought an additional 1,111 BTC , pushing its total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. The acquisition was shared in a regulatory filing , and puts the company within close range of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The latest purchase cost the company approximately 17.26 billion Japanese yen, or about $117 million, with an average purchase price just below $105,500 per coin. Although Bitcoin was trading slightly lower at just under $102,000 at the time of the announcement, Metaplanet’s overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin, keeping the firm well-positioned even in the face of short-term market fluctuations. This move happened after Metaplanet’s previous acquisition of 1,112 BTC just one week earlier, which brought its holdings to 10,000 BTC and cemented its place as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. After briefly slipping to ninth due to an increase in holdings by mining company Hut 8, Metaplanet now regained its eighth-place standing . Top 10 largest Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Tesla is the next target in the rankings, with only 398 more BTC than Metaplanet. This gap could be closed in the coming weeks given the company’s recent momentum. Above Tesla, the next holder is CleanSpark, with 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation is also part of the broader trend among public companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Parataxis Holdings also entered the space with the launch of a Bitcoin-native treasury platform aimed at the South Korean public market. In Norway, K33 recently announced plans to raise approximately $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Block Exchange saw its stock price soar by more than 138% after declaring its intent to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. France-based The Blockchain Group also joined the movement by acquiring 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. As more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the trend appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum. Bitcoin Treasuries Are the New Alt Season Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and inventor of Hashcash, believes the growing trend of public companies adopting Bitcoin treasuries has become the new altcoin season for speculators. On Monday, he stated that “Bitcoin treasury season is the new ALT SZN,” and encouraged investors to move funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of companies accumulating Bitcoin. According to Back, firms are acquiring BTC aggressively, often through methods like convertible note offerings, to increase their Bitcoin per share. This is a strategy that is drawing the attention of market participants looking for stronger exposure to Bitcoin. His comments come during a huge wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with the number of public companies holding BTC doubling since June 5. Back sees this trend as a precursor to “hyperbitcoinization,” a scenario where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global financial system. He previously suggested this shift could turn Bitcoin into a $200 trillion market opportunity, led by treasury-heavy institutions and early government adopters. While the trend is accelerating, it also introduces some risks. For example, Metaplanet saw its Bitcoin premium soar to over $596,000 in late May, indicating that shareholders were paying more than five times the market value of Bitcoin through its stock. This raised questions about the speculative overvaluation of such companies. Nonetheless, Back firmly believes that Bitcoin-focused firms may provide a way out for investors who have suffered losses in altcoins. In a response on X , he suggested that switching to Bitcoin via treasury companies could help these investors recoup some of their altcoin-related losses. Even though altcoins have struggled to gain momentum, some are also seeing institutional traction. Interactive Strength , a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment company, disclosed its intent to raise $500 million to start a token treasury centered on Fetch.ai. This means that the concept of crypto treasuries is expanding beyond just Bitcoin.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9674/sequans-joins-corporate-bitcoin-rush-with-384-m-funding-plan,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
