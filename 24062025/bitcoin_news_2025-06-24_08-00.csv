The company has raised $750 million “from some of the leading institutional investors on Wall Street,” Pompliano posted on X. “The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq,” said Pompliano through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. “As part of the business combination, I have raised over $750 million, which is the largest initial fundraise in history for a publicly-traded bitcoin treasury company.” Today I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial services. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC, LLC and Columbus Circle… — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) June 23, 2025 ProCap to Acquire Bitcoin – BTC Treasury Firms Are on The Rise Pompliano stated that ProCap will strategically acquire Bitcoin and generate revenue and profits from its BTC holdings. Per the official announcement , ProCap Financial will hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It will offer services including trading, lending and capital markets, all denominated in Bitcoin. Further, the $750 million funding includes $235 million in convertible debt, with the remaining amount comprising equity. “It is time to get to work,” said podcast host Pompliano. In a reply to Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, he said, “Your idea is spreading globally as people realize the value of Bitcoin.” Indeed, inspired by Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which currently holds 592,345, after adding 245 Bitcoins on Monday , several public companies are turning into Bitcoin proxies. Intersection of Bitcoin and Traditional Finance However, according to Pompliano, ProCap is pushing beyond that model. He said that the company would build a financial services platform on top of it, besides accumulating Bitcoin. “Our objective is to develop a platform that will not only acquire bitcoin for our balance sheet, but will also implement risk-mitigated solutions to generate revenue and profits from our bitcoin holdings,” he said. Additionally, equity investors will have immediate exposure from day one, the announcement added. “ProCap Financial aims to become the leading financial services firm at the intersection of bitcoin and traditional finance.” Pompliano told CNBC that the goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution, which resonates very differently with capital allocators.

Trump took to his social media network, Truth Social, to state , “It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE.” Trump on the Israel/Iran ceasefire just now: pic.twitter.com/ixibGX3k5v — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 24, 2025 Iranian officials earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, reported Reuters, which added that the country’s foreign minister said “there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.” Bitcoin Reacts Bitcoin prices have surged around 6% since the announcement a few hours ago, climbing from just over $100,000 to come just shy of $106,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday morning. The asset cooled a little, falling back to just over $105,000 at the time of writing. It has now recovered all losses over the past few days and returned to its range-bound channel. BTC fell below six figures for the first time since early May on Monday following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. However, it did not stay below $100,000 for very long. S&P 500 futures also rose marginally late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said that now the sounds of World War III are fading, “macroeconomic tables should be shifting.” The dollar will continue falling, the Renminbi will break out, gold consolidates, and rates are going to fall.

2025-06-24T05:36:06,"Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement","The post Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a dramatic weekend driven by geopolitical unrest, Bitcoin is back in recovery mode. Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, BTC surged past $106,000, reversing Sunday’s dip below $98,500, the lowest in over a month. Crypto Market Rebound on Ceasefire and Fed Bets The sudden recovery wasn’t just about peace talks. Traders are now betting on U.S. interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool showing a 53% chance that rates could fall to 3.75% or lower by November. That’s good news for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on looser monetary policy. Despite the recent $193 million in long liquidations, Bitcoin’s open interest remains robust at $68 billion. This signals continued institutional interest, even in the face of macro turbulence. Bitcoin Hashrate Dips 8%, But Analysts Stay Calm No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy. Firstly, drops like this are common (see chart below) and are more likely due to ERCOT curtailment (being paid to shed load, or getting a price signal it's uneconomical to mine).… https://t.co/AxX3poncZ6 pic.twitter.com/XnL4YGaMCl — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 23, 2025 Bitcoin’s hashrate fell by 8% last week, prompting concerns over mining disruptions, particularly in regions like Iran, where unofficial mining is rumored to consume up to 2GW of electricity. However, analysts like Daniel Batten see no reason to panic. Similar drops occurred during U.S. weather events, like the April storms that slashed hashrate by 27%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street , Crypto investment funds posted $1.24 billion in inflows last week, the tenth straight week of gains.

Short-Bitcoin products saw $1.4 million in outflows, underlining a bullish tilt. Trump Media Fuels Bullish Sentiment Adding more fuel to the fire, Trump Media just greenlit a $400 million stock buyback while filing to launch a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF under the Truth Social brand. The proposed ETF would allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, pending SEC approval. Combined with its $2.3 billion in fresh capital and crypto ambitions, the company’s moves are adding to the overall bullish tone in the market. Bitcoin Price : $110K in Sight? With institutional flows strong, geopolitical fears easing, and Trump’s ETF push catching eyes, the road to $110,000 might not be far off. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next move. Bitcoin’s rally got a major push after Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy dropped a massive $1 billion into BTC. Moreover, this rebound has sparked fresh momentum across the altcoin market too, lifting coins like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Polkadot, and even Pi Network. The market saw it as a strong signal, since big players are doubling down on Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Crypto market reacted sharply to the news of military operations against Iran’s nuclear sites. Bitcoin dropped below $103,000, and major altcoins fell over 9% in 24 hours. The sell-off was mainly due to increased risk aversion, fears of rising oil prices, and concerns that inflation might prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates. Liquidations surged by 38%, exceeding $682 million. Is this a good buying opportunity, or should I wait for more stability? Some users see this as a buying opportunity, especially for those who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. One commenter noted that Bitcoin often drops during geopolitical tensions but tends to bounce back harder than traditional markets. However, others warn that volatility could continue if tensions escalate, so caution is advise What are people doing with their crypto during the crisis? Some are moving funds into cold storage or shifting from high-risk altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are seen as more resilient. Others are taking profits or waiting for further dips before re-entering the market. Will the market recover quickly now that there’s a ceasefire? Sentiment is turning positive after the ceasefire announcement. Bitcoin rebounded above $106,000, and Ethereum surged 9%. Many expect further recovery, especially with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and continued institutional inflows. However, volatility remains high, and some users are still cautious about re-entering the market",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-bitcoin-price-bounce-back-after-trumps-ceasefire-announcement/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T05:35:10,"Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire","The cryptocurrency market rallied on Tuesday, June 24, following news of a potential truce between Israel and Iran, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. According to a June 24 report by Reuters, Trump said both countries had agreed to end hostilities after a 12-day conflict, though Israel has yet to confirm the agreement, and missiles were reportedly launched from Iran early Tuesday. Markets reacted swiftly. After suffering losses over the weekend due to concerns about a wider conflict in the Middle East, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased 2.4% to $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed 3.7% to $105,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) surged 7% to $2,396. Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) also posted strong gains of 7% and 6%, respectively. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 18 points to 65, marking a return to “Greed” territory. Other market indicators suggest improving sentiment. Data from Coinglass shows the average relative strength index across the market rose to 58, a neutral level. Open interest rose by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped to $481 million, down 24% from the previous day. You might also like: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness Markets had turned lower just two days earlier when U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites sparked fears of prolonged conflict and economic disruption. Bitcoin fell nearly 4% to $98,615 at the time, with Ethereum and Solana dropping up to 10%. The attack also led to nearly $1 billion in crypto long- liquidations and a $40 billion loss in total market capitalization. Traders now appear cautiously optimistic. Trump claimed the ceasefire was brokered in coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and mediated through Qatari and U.S. diplomatic channels. While Iranian officials suggested a willingness to pause attacks if Israel halted further aggression, they stopped short of a full commitment. In traditional markets, the ceasefire news also boosted sentiment. After-hours trading saw a 0.4% increase in S&P 500 futures, while oil prices fell from recent highs as concerns about disruptions to Gulf shipping routes subsided. Crypto markets seem to be pricing in a de-escalation for the time being, but traders are still on the lookout for any new developments. The rally might depend on whether the ceasefire holds in the days ahead, as geopolitical risk is still high and neither party has officially confirmed a ceasefire.

2025-06-24T05:33:37,"Sequans Joins Corporate Bitcoin Rush With $384M Funding Plan","After partnering with Swan Bitcoin for treasury management, Sequans now aligns itself with firms like Metaplanet and Nakamoto Holdings, which have aggressively increased their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet bought another 1,111 BTC this week, boosting its total to 11,111 and bringing it within reach of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The corporate Bitcoin adoption trend is gaining global momentum, with firms in Norway, France, and South Korea also jumping in. Meanwhile, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, has dubbed this trend “the new alt season,” and encouraged speculators to shift funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of Bitcoin-holding companies. He believes this wave is a precursor to hyperbitcoinization and a potential $200 trillion Bitcoin market. Despite criticisms from traditional firms like Meta and Microsoft, the enthusiasm surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasuries suggests that there is a transformative shift in how companies view asset diversification and long-term value preservation. Sequans Pushes Into Bitcoin Sequans Communications announced a bold move to raise $384 million to establish a strategic Bitcoin treasury, joining a growing wave of companies betting on Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The IoT semiconductor and module developer plans to raise approximately $195 million through an equity issuance and $189 million via convertible debentures, which could later be converted into company shares. To support this initiative, Sequans is partnering with Swan Bitcoin, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin treasury management. Announcement from Sequans The company's CEO, Georges Karam, explained the long-term investment thesis behind the decision, and called Bitcoin a ”premier asset.” This aligns Sequans with the rising trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasuries with Bitcoin holdings. Just in the past few days, firms like Nakamoto Holdings and Metaplanet expanded their Bitcoin reserves. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that over 240 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, which is almost double from several weeks ago. Collectively, these firms control roughly 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) However, the strategy is not without its critics. Major corporations like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft steered clear of Bitcoin treasury allocations, due to its notorious volatility and the still changing regulatory landscape. For these firms, preserving capital is a priority, and the risk profile of Bitcoin doesn't align with more traditional treasury management objectives. Despite these concerns, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is still a benchmark in the corporate Bitcoin landscape. With a stash of 592,345 BTC valued at over $60 billion, the company continues to lead in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, often leveraging convertible debt to fund its acquisitions. Now that Sequans joined the ranks of Bitcoin-holding companies, the trend of corporate adoption could reshape how institutions approach treasury diversification. Metaplanet Buys 1,111 More BTC Metaplanet, which is Japan’s leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, also announced on Monday that it bought an additional 1,111 BTC , pushing its total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. The acquisition was shared in a regulatory filing , and puts the company within close range of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The latest purchase cost the company approximately 17.26 billion Japanese yen, or about $117 million, with an average purchase price just below $105,500 per coin. Although Bitcoin was trading slightly lower at just under $102,000 at the time of the announcement, Metaplanet’s overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin, keeping the firm well-positioned even in the face of short-term market fluctuations. This move happened after Metaplanet’s previous acquisition of 1,112 BTC just one week earlier, which brought its holdings to 10,000 BTC and cemented its place as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. After briefly slipping to ninth due to an increase in holdings by mining company Hut 8, Metaplanet now regained its eighth-place standing . Top 10 largest Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Tesla is the next target in the rankings, with only 398 more BTC than Metaplanet. This gap could be closed in the coming weeks given the company’s recent momentum. Above Tesla, the next holder is CleanSpark, with 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation is also part of the broader trend among public companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Parataxis Holdings also entered the space with the launch of a Bitcoin-native treasury platform aimed at the South Korean public market. In Norway, K33 recently announced plans to raise approximately $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Block Exchange saw its stock price soar by more than 138% after declaring its intent to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. France-based The Blockchain Group also joined the movement by acquiring 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. As more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the trend appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum. Bitcoin Treasuries Are the New Alt Season Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and inventor of Hashcash, believes the growing trend of public companies adopting Bitcoin treasuries has become the new altcoin season for speculators. On Monday, he stated that “Bitcoin treasury season is the new ALT SZN,” and encouraged investors to move funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of companies accumulating Bitcoin. According to Back, firms are acquiring BTC aggressively, often through methods like convertible note offerings, to increase their Bitcoin per share. This is a strategy that is drawing the attention of market participants looking for stronger exposure to Bitcoin. His comments come during a huge wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with the number of public companies holding BTC doubling since June 5. Back sees this trend as a precursor to “hyperbitcoinization,” a scenario where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global financial system. He previously suggested this shift could turn Bitcoin into a $200 trillion market opportunity, led by treasury-heavy institutions and early government adopters. While the trend is accelerating, it also introduces some risks. For example, Metaplanet saw its Bitcoin premium soar to over $596,000 in late May, indicating that shareholders were paying more than five times the market value of Bitcoin through its stock. This raised questions about the speculative overvaluation of such companies. Nonetheless, Back firmly believes that Bitcoin-focused firms may provide a way out for investors who have suffered losses in altcoins. In a response on X , he suggested that switching to Bitcoin via treasury companies could help these investors recoup some of their altcoin-related losses. Even though altcoins have struggled to gain momentum, some are also seeing institutional traction. Interactive Strength , a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment company, disclosed its intent to raise $500 million to start a token treasury centered on Fetch.ai. This means that the concept of crypto treasuries is expanding beyond just Bitcoin.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9674/sequans-joins-corporate-bitcoin-rush-with-384-m-funding-plan,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T05:26:01,"Dogecoin Surges 7% as Bulls Break Key Resistance","Dogecoin surged 6.56% over the past 24 hours, bouncing from a two-month low of $0.1508 to a session high of $0.1632, as traders stepped in aggressively following a technical breakout. The move came amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which triggered broad volatility across crypto markets but failed to derail DOGE’s momentum. The meme coin broke through a long-standing descending trendline, confirming a shift in short-term market structure. Hourly RSI readings recovered from oversold territory, while netflows turned neutral, suggesting that sell-side exhaustion may have run its course. News Background Global markets have been rattled by renewed military activity in the Middle East, with U.S. airstrikes in Iran over the weekend raising risk-off sentiment. Despite the wider crypto selloff, Dogecoin showed relative strength, recovering faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum and pushing past key resistance levels. Technical analysts note that the rally was driven by a sharp increase in trading activity, particularly during the 22:00 UTC hour, when volume surged past 800 million units and price spiked 3.77% in under 60 minutes. The breakout has sparked renewed discussion about a potential retest of the $0.17–$0.18 range if volume remains elevated and global risk sentiment stabilizes. Dogecoin’s network fundamentals also remain intact, with transaction volume and active wallet counts trending higher over the past week. While macro conditions remain fragile, the memecoin’s resilience is capturing renewed attention from traders betting on short-term altcoin rotation. Price Action Dogecoin traded in a broad range from $0.1508 to $0.1632 over the session, ultimately settling around $0.1615. The $0.150 zone acted as a springboard after the asset reached a local bottom following weeks of declining momentum. A clean break above $0.162 resistance has now established a short-term higher high, with $0.165 emerging as the next level to watch. The final hour of the session saw minor consolidation, with DOGE pulling back slightly from intraday highs and forming a potential bull flag above $0.161. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE posted a 6.56% gain, rising from $0.153 to $0.1632 over 24 hours • Price broke above a descending trendline, confirming bullish breakout • Key support formed at $0.150 after a two-month low, with volume over 800M during rebound • $0.165 now acts as short-term resistance; $0.162 holding as support • RSI has exited oversold conditions; MACD signals a potential continuation • Final-hour pullback remains shallow, indicating healthy consolidation",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/dogecoin-surges-7-as-bulls-break-key-resistance,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|AI Market Insights|Dogecoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T05:15:49,"Ether, Solana, Cardano Spike 7% as Trump Claims to Broker Israel-Iran Ceasefire","A fragile calm swept across risk assets on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, sparking a rally in crypto majors. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump said on his Truth Social account. Ether ETH, Solana's SOL SOL, and Cardano's ADA ADA surged around 7% in the past 24 hours. Ether climbed back above $2,400, while SOL and ADA rose over support at $140 and 50 cents respectively. Crypto trading volumes also rebounded after a brutal Sunday-Monday flush that saw nearly $600 million in long liquidations. XRP XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, and dogecoin DOGE also rose between 4%-6%. The broader CoinDesk 20 CD20}], a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, rose over 3%. The bounce followed a wave of macro relief. Brent crude slipped 1.8% and S&P 500 futures turned positive, even as the ceasefire lacked formal confirmation from either government. But traders were quick to rotate back into altcoins, betting on a volatility cooldown. “We think the market will soon normalize and move on from the latest geopolitical episode,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “But we’re more worried about a bigger shake-out to stop out recent longs… and the negative FOMO signals from all the public companies looking to establish new BTC treasuries as their latest financial engineering gig,” Fan added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin {{BTC continues to consolidate near $105,000, testing overhead resistance as institutional flows hold steady. Some see structural strength in the asset's performance over the past few weeks. “Its ability to hold above $100K underscores resilience amid geopolitical and macro volatility,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk. “As institutional inflows and ETF demand rebound, BTC’s decoupling from traditional risk-off signals suggests a maturing role as a macro hedge in the long term,” Lu added. Still, some traders caution that the next leg of the move could be driven by profit-taking, especially in overheated tokens, such as ether.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $600 support zone. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).

There was a move above the $620 and $625 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $644 level. The next resistance sits near the $650 level. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $665. A close above the $665 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline?

2025-06-24T05:07:45,"Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street","The post Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Shocks Wall Street appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Iran-Israel conflict shakes global markets, Trump Media is pushing forward with bold crypto moves. Founded by U.S. President Donald Trump, the company has just approved a $400 million stock buyback while reaffirming its strong commitment to digital assets. Meanwhile, Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire led to a 3.2% gain in Bitcoin’s value over 24 hours , with the cryptocurrency holding firm above the $100,000 mark despite the recent bloodbath. Stock Buyback Shows Confidence Trump Media has approved a $400 million stock buyback plan to return value to shareholders while signaling strong confidence in its long-term strategy. CEO Devin Nunes highlighted that with $3 billion on the company’s balance sheet, there’s enough flexibility to fund the buyback without affecting its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. Nunes called Bitcoin “a crown jewel” and said the repurchase is also meant to protect the company from what he described as discrimination against conservative businesses by financial institutions. The funds are part of a broader push to support Trump-branded crypto products, including upcoming ETFs, pending regulatory approval. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still on Track While the buyback grabbed headlines, the real game-changer is Trump Media’s ongoing plan to build a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury . The strategy, similar to what Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has done, signals the company’s intent to become a major crypto holder. The plan includes a private placement offering to fund the crypto reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement , In short, Trump Media is going all-in on crypto with fresh capital and bold plans. It filed to register nearly 85 million shares for resale and secured $2.3 billion through deals with about 50 investors, including $100 million from Chicago-based firm DRW. Additionally, the company has taken things a step further by filing for a combined Bitcoin-Ether ETF in partnership with Crypto.com. The fund is expected to hold 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum, aiming to capitalize on both leading cryptocurrencies. This funding supports its Bitcoin treasury strategy, though the company hasn’t revealed how much BTC it holds yet. Meanwhile, its stock (DJT) rose over 3% on Monday, hitting $18.39 after weeks of sharp declines. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

CEO Devin Nunes emphasized Bitcoin as a core asset that symbolizes financial freedom and independence—especially against what they describe as discrimination from traditional financial institutions. Will the SEC approve Trump Media’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF? It’s unclear. While the SEC has started approving Bitcoin ETFs, a politically affiliated company might face extra scrutiny. However, having a partner like Crypto.com may improve their chances. Is Trump Media really buying billions in Bitcoin, or is it all just hype? So far, Trump Media has announced a $2.3B Bitcoin treasury plan, but they haven’t disclosed actual purchases or wallet addresses. What’s the deal with the $400M stock buyback—why now? Redditors speculate it’s to boost investor confidence after sharp stock declines and distract from the lack of real Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Others say it’s a standard financial tactic—but timed to ride the bullish crypto news cycle. Is this Bitcoin reserve made of newly bought crypto or just seized assets? Reddit threads (especially on r/Buttcoin) suggest some of the BTC might be seized assets now labeled as a “reserve.” If true, this wouldn’t involve new market purchases—raising concerns about the plan’s authenticity.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trump-media-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-shocks-wall-street/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Since then, Cardano has recorded seven consecutive red daily candles and fallen below the $0.60 support. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Cardano’s rally will be halted unless some ground is recovered. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency’s multi-month price action “ended up being a classic distribution schematic” after losing the $0.66 support. This would signal that ADA’s uptrend has ended and a potential downtrend is ahead. “As long as we don’t reclaim $0.66, just expect further downtrend from now on,” he asserted. Meanwhile, market watcher Man of Bitcoin highlighted the cryptocurrency’s June downtrend, affirming that if the price remains below the descending trendline, downward pressure will persist. He added that “One more low in wave iv is still possible,” hinting that a drop below the $0.50 could be on the horizon before the next wave up. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that “it should be a brief wick to the downside” as a “sustained break lower would weaken the bullish outlook.” ADA Retest To Trigger Rally To $1? Amid the ongoing global war tensions, ADA’s price retested the crucial $0.52 support on Sunday, hitting a four-month low of $0.51, before recovering and closing the week around the $0.54 mark. Market watcher Rose Premium Signals noted that a weekly close around the crucial $0.56 level would continue the possible double-bottom setup forming on ADA’s chart. The analyst added that a confirmed rebound from the $0.54-$0-56 area could send the price to the initial $0.99 target and set the stage for a climb toward the $1.20 and $1.50 resistances. On the contrary, failing to hold this area could see Cardano lose its six-month price range and retrace to the $0.32 level. Meanwhile, Crypto Billion affirmed that Cardano appears to be forming a potential triple bottom structure, which could lead to a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move As the cryptocurrency retested the $0.50-$0.52 area over the weekend, the analyst highlighted that this key range had been held twice before since the November breakout. Additionally, he pointed out that ADA’s price appears to be trading within a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which suggests a breakout toward the $1 mark if the price climbs toward the upper boundary. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.54, a 15.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-24T04:30:49,"Could Traders Rotating from Bitcoin and XRP to MAGACOIN FINANCE Spark a VeChain Surge?","Introduction The June 2025 market is seeing a dramatic shift in capital flow. As Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes above $105,000 and XRP’s rally slows, a new rotation trend is emerging. Early-stage plays are taking the spotlight, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the centerpiece. This surge in attention could trigger a ripple effect for overlooked altcoins—especially VeChain (VET), which technical analysts say may be next in line. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Money Is Moving Capital is flooding into MAGACOIN FINANCE , as both retail and institutional investors seek a structured early-stage asset with upside. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, a fully audited contract, and active staking rewards, the project is gaining rapid traction. Key highlights: 100% community-owned and inflation-proof All presale phases selling out in record time Forecast listing of $0.007 and upside ROI potential in 2025 Investor behavior shows strong conviction, with buyers holding rather than flipping. That long-term positioning is what’s driving the project’s credibility—and FOMO. VeChain (VET): Technical Setup and Market Attention VeChain is currently trading near $0.022, with many traders forecasting a climb toward $0.035 in June. Long-term consolidation has set the foundation for a potential breakout. While fundamentals in logistics and enterprise adoption remain strong, recent attention has shifted away—giving VET a chance to quietly build momentum under the radar. How MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Trigger a VET Move The current rotation from legacy coins into MAGACOIN FINANCE is unlocking broader liquidity. As capital exits the sidelines and moves toward higher-risk, higher-reward setups, altcoins with solid use cases like VeChain could see a wave of renewed interest. VET’s structure and timing align well for a bounce—especially if the MAGACOIN FINANCE rally leads sentiment across the board. Conclusion The rotation trend of 2025 is clear: Bitcoin and XRP profits are now fueling MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise—and VeChain may be the next to benefit. As traders look for the next undervalued gem, VET’s technical foundation and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum could prove to be the perfect combination.

Some believe this might happen before ETF approvals and the FedNow launch on July 14. Ripple Paying SEC Fine in Cash, Not XRP However, former SEC official Marc Fagel has put those rumors to rest saying they are not paying in XRP.

The most probable outcome, he says, is both parties accepting the summary judgment, along with a penalty and permanent injunction. The court is now waiting on a key SEC filing due by mid-August.

2025-06-24T04:00:11,"Bitcoin’s Drop Below $100k Sparks Bearish Chatter, But Data Says Something Else","Bitcoin has rebounded slightly after dropping below the $100,000 mark, a decline attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions. The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a “staircase” trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.

A new airdrop event by Midnight , a privacy-focused blockchain connected to Cardano, is now live, offering free NIGHT tokens to eligible ADA holders. And no, it’s not just a few tokens — the numbers are quite impressive . So, here’s how to claim your FREE Night token. What Is Midnight and Why Does It Matter? Midnight is a fully integrated partner chain of Cardano that utilizes Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for its security and governance. What sets it apart is its strong multichain strategy, targeting not only Cardano users but also holders on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more. However, the ongoing buzz is mostly around the “Glacier Drop”, the first phase of Midnight’s token distribution plan. According to the project’s whitepaper , 12 billion NIGHT tokens—half of the entire supply—will be given away to eligible users. And the largest beneficiary of this ecosystem will be the Cardano wallet holders. More Than Just an Airdrop—It’s Cardano’s Growth Catalyst What’s exciting is that Midnight isn’t some side project—it’s deeply tied into Cardano’s architecture. The NIGHT token is minted directly on Cardano. Stake pool operators (SPOs) can even earn NIGHT without giving up ADA rewards. With strong tokenomics, real utility, and multichain support, Midnight might be the boost Cardano needs to reclaim its spotlight in the crypto space. How to Claim Your NIGHT Tokens To be eligible for the Midnight airdrop, you must have held at least $100 worth of ADA in a Cardano wallet at the time of a previously taken snapshot. Midnight is bringing private smart contracts, cross-chain privacy, and dual-token mechanics ($NIGHT + $DUST ). It’s free to claim if you qualify — don’t miss it. For more alpha follow @onewisemelon — melon (@onewisemelon) June 23, 2025 The claiming process is simple and gas-free, just sign with your wallet and provide a clean Cardano address. There’s no KYC or cost involved. How Much NIGHT Could You Receive? However, each person’s airdrop amount depends on how much ADA they held compared to others. For example, if you held 5,000 ADA, and the total eligible pool was 1.5 billion ADA, you’d receive around 40,000 NIGHT tokens. How Much 1 NIGHT Token Worth? Now here’s where it gets interesting. If NIGHT reaches a $500 million market cap, each token could be worth around $0.0208, which means your free 40,000 NIGHT tokens could be worth over $800. There is a 60-day window to claim your tokens, and they won’t be usable right away. Meanwhile, claimed tokens will first be locked and will “thaw” gradually during the Redemption period, allowing holders to access them over time.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/midnight-airdrop-alert-heres-how-to-claim-your-free-night-tokens/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|AIRDROP","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) remain dominant forces, but many traders are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for its rare early-stage upside. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is also on the radar, though its recent volatility has prompted a shift in capital toward projects with stronger momentum and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about pre-sale of 2025 , with over $10 million raised and every phase selling out at record speed. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven tokenomics, full audit, and disciplined rollout as key reasons for its surge in demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a reputation for credibility and long-term potential, with experts’ analysis citing: Capped token supply and full HashEx audit , ensuring long-term integrity and no stealth inflation Strong retail and institutional interest , with momentum growing across altcoin trading communities Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin continues to set the tone for crypto markets, trading above $105,000 and attracting significant institutional inflows. While BTC remains a benchmark for bullish sentiment, its massive market cap now implies more stability and less explosive upside compared to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Many seasoned BTC holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking the kind of sharp returns that defined Bitcoin’s early years. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum, But Investors Seek More Solana is drawing strong forecasts, with some projecting 2025 highs between $220 and $1,000. Its ecosystem growth and potential ETF inclusion are fueling optimism. However, as SOL matures, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for its greater upside potential and scarcity-driven model. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Volatility Spurs Diversification NEAR Protocol is experiencing heightened volatility, recently dropping to $1.89 despite increased trading volume. While some analysts expect a potential recovery, the broader sentiment is cautious. With support levels weakening and resistance holding firm, investors are seeking more stable growth paths—leading many to diversify into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion In a market where timing and structure are everything, even a small investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could reshape portfolios for those who act early.

Investors seem to be treating this pullback as a chance to buy, not a reason to sell. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead The Pack According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin pulled in $1.114 billion this week alone.

Other altcoin vehicles are in rough shape, with $509 million of outflows since January. Regional Trends Highlight The US The United States led global flows with $1.25 billion in weekly inflows. That’s $3.37 billion month-to-date and $14.30 billion YTD, out of $135 billion under management. Canada added nearly $21 million this week and $42.8 million for June. Germany chipped in almost $11 million while Australia booked $16.6 million.

2025-06-24T03:00:47,"Analysts Explain Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Follow Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Path to Success with Polkadot","As the crypto market enters a new phase of growth, established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to set the pace, while Polkadot (DOT) maintains its reputation as a leading interoperability platform. Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a breakout contender, drawing comparisons to the early trajectories of these market leaders and positioning itself as a high-upside opportunity in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly building momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, supported by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, underpinned by a transparent governance structure and a strong community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Analysts note the project’s structured rollout and scarcity mechanics, which historically have produced outsized returns for early entrants. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Momentum and Market Anchor Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $112,000 and supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. Analysts see potential for BTC to reach $130,000–$200,000 if the current uptrend persists. While Bitcoin’s upside is steady, its early-stage success story is inspiring investors to seek similar growth in new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Network Strength Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, trading above $2,500 and benefiting from institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Growth Potential Polkadot is trading near $4.74, with forecasts pointing to a possible rise to $5.03 by the end of May 8 . While DOT’s gains are modest compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it remains a key player in the interoperability sector. Analysts highlight Polkadot’s long-term potential, but many investors are now seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market and Polkadot maintaining its role as a key interoperability platform, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could follow a similar path to success—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

2025-06-24T02:51:12,"Texas has created the first state-funded Bitcoin reserve","Texas has become the first US state to establish a publicly funded, stand-alone Bitcoin reserve after Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend. Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which approved similar legislation, Texas allowed the reserve and provided funding for it. The state has allocated $10 million to invest in the Bitcoin reserve. With this approach, Texas has made a significant step toward the future of finance. Trump’s pro-crypto stance attracts more US states to adopt Bitcoin reserves The Bill 21 requires the state to set up a Bitcoin reserve that operates separately from the main treasury. This aligns with a few other states also looking into digital asset reserves. The announcement that Texas has allocated $10 million for a Bitcoin reserve comes months after the Trump administration said it would establish a national crypto reserve. However, such a vehicle is supposed to be funded strictly by budget-neutral means, such as crypto asset seizures or issuing crypto bonds. Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that shields the Bitcoin reserve from standard “fund sweeps” into the state’s general revenue. The legislation changes how states handle digital assets, not just as speculative devices, but as sovereign financial instruments that one might want to hold onto for the long term. Texas sets up Bitcoin reserve to fight inflation and flex financial muscle Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), which finally allowed the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to the bill’s text, the new reserve will help make the state more financially resilient while acting as a potential hedge against inflation. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold only Bitcoin currently has. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund and be guided by an advisory committee with three crypto investment experts. Aside from direct purchases, the reserve could be filled through forks, airdrops, investment profits, or public crypto donations. A public report listing the fund’s holdings and performance will be issued every two years. With this, Texas becomes the third state in the US to pass Bitcoin reserve legislation. Public firms demonstrate a growing trend of purchasing more BTC for their treasuries Several publicly traded companies follow Michael Saylor’s strategy by adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For instance, on Friday, June 20, US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency adviser, David Bailey‘s Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, raised $51.5 million in new funds through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal to purchase more BTC. Moreover, last week, The Blockchain Group, a technology company listed in Paris, increased its Bitcoin reserves by buying 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. This purchase raised its total holdings to 1,653 BTC. Just over the past month, companies have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, a trend that has been documented with the help of data from BitcoinTreasuries. Furthermore, NET shows public companies still have an appetite for BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-24T02:50:20,"Senator Adam Schiff Moves to Ban Presidents and Families From Profiting Off Crypto","Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced legislation on Monday that would bar the president, vice president, and their immediate family members from engaging in crypto-related business ventures while holding office. Key Takeaways: Senator Schiff’s COIN Act would bar the president and family members from issuing or endorsing crypto. The bill requires disclosure of any digital asset sale over $1,000. It also suggests penalties including fines and prison time for violations. The bill, titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act , comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the context of former President Donald Trump’s expanding crypto footprint. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. New Bill Requires Disclosure of Digital Asset Sales Over $1,000 The new bill also mandates disclosure of any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. Violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff directly linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings. “President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family,” he said in a statement. However, the timing of Schiff’s move has raised eyebrows. Just last week, he voted in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. And here it is: An Obama holdover?

Democrats initially balked at the GOP’s refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. But facing pressure to push the legislation through, they ultimately relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor. Nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the GENIUS Act. Other Democratic-led proposals targeting Trump’s crypto ventures include the MEME Act and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

2025-06-24T02:45:06,"Here’s How Bitcoin Volatility Cost a Veteran Swing Trader $35M","A stunning misstep amid Bitcoin’s recent price swings caused by escalating Middle East tensions has reportedly seen seasoned crypto trader AguilaTrades lose over $35 million in just two weeks. According to a detailed thread posted on X by on-chain analytics account Lookonchain on June 23, the punter’s aggressive leveraged bets unraveled spectacularly as the Israel-Iran conflict rocked global markets and sent crypto prices on a wild ride. Anatomy of a $35M Meltdown Lookonchain’s forensic analysis traced the rapid downfall of a wallet linked to AguilaTrades, who publicly celebrated a number 1 ranking on Bybit in late 2024, and claimed to have turned U.S. election predictions into a $50 million windfall. The sequence in question started on June 8, when the trader moved $39.18 million in USDC from Bybit to perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. His strategy was straightforward, aggressively leveraging long positions on BTC. He initiated his first major long on June 9, making paper gains of around $5.6 million. However, he refused to take profits, a decision that proved disastrous when Bitcoin plunged sharply after Israel made a preemptive attack on several strategic Iranian nuclear installations and military personnel. As a result, he was forced to close this position at a $12.47 million loss. The investor didn’t give up, though, doubling down with new long positions on June 15 and June 20, both of which saw significant gains. The former bet put him $10 million in the black, while the latter resulted in a more modest but no less grin-inducing $3.2 million in unrealized profit. Once again, AguilaTrades didn’t collect on his windfall, choosing instead to push his luck some more. Fate wouldn’t be tempted, nonetheless, and over the weekend, things went from bad to worse, with the U.S. executing direct military strikes on Iran, and the Persian Gulf state reportedly voting to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key oil transit chokepoint. The action saw BTC crash below $100,000 for the first time since the last week of May, liquidating both of AguilaTrades’ positions and causing him losses of $2.95 million and $17 million, respectively. Data from CoinGlass confirmed that he was not alone in his misery, with over $700 million in leveraged positions liquidated on Saturday alone. According to Lookonchain, the trader made one final dice throw, choosing to go short this time. But, in a cruel twist, Bitcoin bounced back , leaving the luckless investor with an additional $2.33 million loss. “Don’t Be Greedy” The analytics platform bluntly summarized the grim lesson: “Don’t be greedy—take profits. Don’t FOMO into positions during a rally. Avoid using high leverage.” BTC was trading around $101,429 at this writing, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and 5.2% over seven days. It has shown relative resilience compared to the broader crypto market, which lost 7.1% of its value in the past week, a fact that will be of little solace to those caught over-leveraged.

2025-06-24T02:23:56,"Bitcoin Reclaims $106K After Trump’s Israel-Iran Ceasefire — Is $110K Next?","Bitcoin bounced back above the $106,000 mark on late Monday, following a brief drop below $98,500 on Sunday, the lowest level in 45 days. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin recovered to $106K after dipping below $98.5K, following Trump’s ceasefire announcement. An 8% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate raised concerns, though analysts say such volatility is not unusual. Markets are now pricing in higher odds of Fed rate cuts, supporting risk assets like BTC. The recovery came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, calming market nerves after a weekend of geopolitical uncertainty. The sudden price dip led to $193 million in liquidations of long leveraged Bitcoin positions, but that accounted for just 0.3% of total open interest. With roughly $68 billion in leveraged positions still active, the derivatives market remains largely unaffected. Bitcoin’s Hashrate Drops 8% in One Week Adding to the volatility, Bitcoin’s hashrate dropped 8% over the past week, from 943.6 million TH/s to 865.1 million TH/s, fueling speculation of disrupted mining activity. Analysts have pointed to Iran’s role in global mining, though accurate data remains elusive. Reports suggest up to 2 gigawatts of electricity may be consumed by unauthorized mining operations in the country. However, sudden hashrate fluctuations are not uncommon. Energy-related shutdowns in the U.S. are often the cause. Analyst Daniel Batten noted similar dips occur during extreme weather events, such as the April 22 storms in Texas and Oklahoma that temporarily slashed hashrate by 27%. No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy. Firstly, drops like this are common (see chart below) and are more likely due to ERCOT curtailment (being paid to shed load, or getting a price signal it's uneconomical to mine).… https://t.co/AxX3poncZ6 pic.twitter.com/XnL4YGaMCl — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 23, 2025 On the macro front, oil prices dropped sharply Monday, retreating from a Sunday peak of $77, as broader markets responded positively to the ceasefire. The S&P 500 rose 1%, while expectations grew for U.S. interest rate cuts. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, the probability of the Federal Reserve maintaining its current 4.25% rate through November has fallen to 8.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of rates dropping to 3.75% or lower rose to 53%, up from 38% last week. Whether Bitcoin can break through $110,000 remains uncertain, but the quick recovery suggests institutional appetite hasn’t weakened. For now, traders are balancing optimism over de-escalation with caution around global and macroeconomic developments. Crypto Funds Log $1.24B in 10th Week of Inflows Crypto funds recorded $1.24 billion in inflows last week, marking the tenth consecutive week of gains and pushing year-to-date totals to a record $15.1 billion. Despite the milestone, the pace of inflows slowed in the latter half of the week. The report attributed the decline to the U.S. Juneteenth holiday and rising geopolitical uncertainty surrounding reports of U.S. involvement in the Iran conflict . The US remained the primary driver, contributing $1.25 billion in inflows. Canada and Germany added $20.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Bitcoin attracted $1.1 billion in fresh capital, marking its second straight week of inflows despite recent price weakness, signaling continued appetite among institutional buyers. Short-Bitcoin products, meanwhile, saw modest outflows of $1.4 million, reinforcing the bullish bias.

2025-06-24T02:00:46,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outperform Bitcoin and Solana—SEI Traders Agree","As Bitcoin and Solana continue to dominate the crypto landscape through institutional adoption and rapid technical innovation, a new contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is quickly emerging as the most-watched altcoin for breakout potential in 2025 . With SEI ecosystem traders and top analysts now spotlighting this pre-sale, the stage is set for a disruptive new entry that could reshape the altcoin narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Advantage MAGACOIN FINANCE is forecasted by analysts to deliver returns that could outpace even sector giants, with projections of a 75x–100x surge upon listing. Strategic investors are flocking to its pre-sale, drawn by a capped supply, full audit, and zero stealth minting risk. Unlike Bitcoin and Solana—now tied to macro trends and ETF flows—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare early-stage entry point with outsized ROI potential. Each presale phase is filling fast, fueled by transparent tokenomics, community-first incentives, and SEI traders rotating profits into what many call the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin & Solana: Strength, But Limited Explosive Upside Bitcoin is trading above $105,000, buoyed by ETF inflows and supportive policy, while Solana’s ecosystem is booming with upgrades and institutional traction. Both assets are expected to post steady gains, with Solana forecasted to reach the $270 range and Bitcoin potentially targeting $135,000–$175,000 by year-end. However, their massive market caps now suggest more stability and less room for the kind of exponential moves seen in earlier cycles. SEI: Bullish Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight SEI is drawing attention for its uptrend and robust ecosystem, with forecasts suggesting a rise toward the $1 range by year-end. Yet, even as SEI posts strong gains, traders are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its unmatched early-stage upside and rapidly growing community. The pre-sale’s momentum and security assurances are setting a new standard for what’s possible in 2025’s altcoin market. Conclusion: The Breakout Story of 2025? While Bitcoin, Solana, and SEI remain strong performers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of traders and analysts alike. With a scarcity-driven model, robust security, and surging demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout altcoin story of 2025—especially for those who position early.

2025-06-24T02:00:20,"Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top","After a brief drop to $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered and is now trading above $101,000 at the time of writing. While concerns about a potential double top persist, on-chain data has yet to show any major warning signs. Bitcoin Undergoing Healthy Consolidation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Avocado_onchain, despite broader market sentiment turning bearish, BTC has not yet displayed any significant red flags. In fact, the cryptocurrency still appears to be in a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Pull 4,500 BTC From Binance, Hinting At Incoming Rally Notably, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicates that long-term holders are continuing to hold onto their BTC rather than selling. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for further upside in the near term. For the uninitiated, the 30-day MA Binary CDD smooths out daily fluctuations to show how frequently long-term Bitcoin holders are moving their coins over a month. A lower value suggests strong holding behavior and accumulation, while a higher value may indicate distribution or selling pressure from experienced holders. The analyst noted in a previous analysis that when Bitcoin’s Binary CDD exceeded 0.8, it was typically followed by a steep correction. However, this time, the indicator has peaked around 0.6 and is now on the decline – suggesting the market is far from overheating. They added: Although the data may not align perfectly from cycle to cycle, this moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow. The analyst emphasized that this indicator does not signal the end of the bull run. Rather – similar to the previous two market phases – Bitcoin could be following a “staircase-like movement,” where periods of consolidation are followed by a strong upward leg. They concluded that BTC historically tends to rally when market attention fades and sentiment remains quiet. Therefore, the current period of low volatility could be a precursor to Bitcoin’s next major move to the upside. Are BTC Bears In Trouble? While the current bearish sentiment may have raised hopes for further price pullback for the largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap, both technical and on-chain indicators suggest otherwise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says For example, short positions have been rising sharply within the $100,000–$110,000 range, increasing the likelihood of a short squeeze – which could drive BTC to a new all-time high (ATH).

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rare opportunity—analysts are increasingly calling it the most undervalued crypto asset of the year , mirroring the early dynamics of Bitcoin’s historic bull runs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Momentum and Analyst Confidence Unlike fleeting meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a scarcity-focused framework and a community-first governance model. Its fixed supply and structured tokenomics have triggered rapid sellouts across every pre-sale phase, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Experts say the current valuation is significantly disconnected from its long-term upside—a pattern historically associated with substantial returns, echoing early Bitcoin cycles. A full smart contract audit and aggressive marketing strategy further strengthen the project’s credibility. As altcoin rotation accelerates, analysts project exponential gains as MAGACOIN FINANCE enters price discovery on major exchanges. Bitcoin’s Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin recently broke above $111,000, fueled by institutional inflows, ETF approvals, and a surge in whale accumulation. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from here is seen as more modest compared to early-stage altcoins. Analysts believe the next phase of the bull cycle will see capital rotating into high-upside tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, echoing the pattern that sent Ethereum and Solana soaring after Bitcoin’s previous peaks. Ethereum and Injective Protocol: Momentum and Upgrades Ethereum, despite a recent security scare, is expected to stabilize and regain momentum as network upgrades and innovation continue. Meanwhile, Injective Protocol’s launch of INJ 3.0 and deflationary tokenomics have secured overwhelming community support, positioning it as a leader in the next wave of innovation. Both ETH and INJ are seeing capital rotate into early-stage opportunities, with many traders now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next breakout candidate. Conclusion: The Rare Setup Everyone’s Watching With Bitcoin’s rally confirming the bull market and Ethereum and Injective Protocol driving innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-upside play analysts say could echo the legendary returns of past bull cycles. As pre-sale stages sell out and momentum builds, the window for early entry is closing fast—making MAGACOIN FINANCE a top contender for 2025’s breakout story.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it’s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? It’s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week.

2025-06-24T00:53:15,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Jumps Past $105K as Israel-Iran Ceasefire Sparks Risk-On Surge","Bitcoin reclaimed $105,000 in the early Asian session on Tuesday, rallying nearly 4.5% in 24 hours after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a full ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. The deal, negotiated through Gulf intermediaries and direct talks with Israeli and Iranian officials, marks a dramatic de-escalation after nearly two weeks of military strikes. The crypto market responded immediately. With tensions cooling and traditional safe havens like gold plateauing, Bitcoin regained its risk-on momentum. Traders are betting that a period of regional stability could restore confidence in speculative assets. Trump credited early Iranian warning of a retaliatory missile strike for avoiding casualties at U.S. bases in Qatar, which helped pave the way for the truce. As regional hostilities paused, investors rotated out of defensive positions and re-entered crypto markets. Breaking News Trump has posted that he has brokered and ""complete and total ceasefire"" between Iran and Israel. #Iran #IranIsraelConflict #Trump #ceasefire pic.twitter.com/zQPraXx7Qa — The Blue Collar Intellectual (Julian) (@JulianAcciard1) June 23, 2025 Why Peace Lifts BTC and Crypto Geopolitical clarity tends to revive appetite for higher-risk assets. Ceasefire agreements, especially those with direct U.S. involvement, often act as catalysts for equity and crypto rebounds. Reduced global uncertainty restores market confidence. Traders unwind hedges like gold and bonds. Volatility decreases, encouraging capital inflows to crypto. Bitcoin, known for its sharp sensitivity to macro headlines, acts as a barometer for global sentiment. With risk appetite returning, its rebound above $105K could signal broader recovery across altcoins and digital assets. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction turned bullish following the cryptocurrency’s recent surge, pushing it through the 50-period EMA at $103,806 and forming a strong bullish engulfing pattern. Momentum indicators like MACD have turned decisively bullish, with a wide histogram and crossover signal suggesting more upside. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, BTC now faces critical trendline resistance near $106,000. This level marks the descending barrier from June highs and remains a key decision zone for bulls. Key Levels: Resistance: $106,000, $107,580, $109,041 Support: $103,965, $102,199, $100,487 Trade Idea: A confirmed breakout above $106K on strong volume may open a run toward $109K. A failed retest or bearish engulfing at $106K could send BTC back to $102K. With over $64.9B in daily trading volume and a $2.09 trillion market cap, Bitcoin remains technically balanced but fundamentally charged. The Israel-Iran ceasefire may be the pivot traders needed to chase higher highs, as long as peace holds.

2025-06-24T00:30:45,"Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Traders Are Quietly Accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE with Kaspa","As the crypto market pivots toward the next bullish cycle, a new trend is emerging: seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traders are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE—often alongside rising star Kaspa (KAS). With blue-chip assets stabilizing, the spotlight is shifting to early-stage projects that offer scarcity-driven growth and asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity, Structure, and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly gained traction as one of 2025’s most promising altcoins , joining the ranks of top bullish picks for the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its hard-cap mechanics, community-led rollout, and audited smart contract, ensuring no VC dilution or inflation risk. Its rapid series of sold-out pre-sale stages reflects real strategic demand. Its scarcity model and limited access favor early believers, creating the same kind of supply shock potential that fueled Ethereum’s early rise. On-chain activity shows that accumulation isn’t random: large, informed capital is locking in positions now, echoing historical patterns from past altcoin cycles. Bitcoin: Solid Foundation, Slower Expansion Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading at impressive levels with continued institutional interest. While BTC offers long-term security, many traders recognize that its upside is increasingly capped by market maturity. As a result, investors are branching out into smaller-cap projects with higher potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , in search of greater ROI while maintaining a core BTC position. Ethereum: Innovation Leader, but Competitive Ethereum continues to dominate as the leading smart contract platform, driven by its ongoing upgrades and expanding network utility. However, its price movements are now closely tied to regulatory headlines and broader macro trends. Traders seeking outsized returns are increasingly diversifying into earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers exposure to rapid growth without Ethereum’s scale limitations. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Upside Kaspa is also gaining traction for its technical fundamentals and blockDAG technology, appealing to long-term builders and early adopters. However, while KAS offers calculated growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is engineered for exponential upside, with entry windows still open for those seeking multi-x returns. Conclusion: The Early Entry Window Is Closing With Bitcoin and Ethereum traders leading the charge and Kaspa providing steady growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout contender for 2025. Its scarcity-driven model, robust structure, and analyst-backed momentum make it a rare early-stage opportunity as the next cycle unfolds.

2025-06-24T00:01:00,"Crypto bull run: here’s why Bitcoin and altcoins are rising","Bitcoin and other altcoins could be about to start a new crypto bull run after going parabolic on Monday and Tuesday. BTC jumped to $105,000, while top coins like Sei, Movement, Useless Coin, and Launch Coin on Believe jumped to over 20%. Here’s the top reasons why Bitcoin and top altcoins are going up, and whether the gains will stick. Crypto bull run happened as the Middle East crisis cooled The main reason why Bitcoin and other altcoins are in a new crypto bull run is that there are signs that the crisis in the Middle East has cooled. Donald Trump launched bombs to three key sites in Iran during the weekend to destroy its nuclear program. He also threatened to implement new regime change in the country. Iranian response to the crisis was relatively mild as officials did not want further escalation. It launched missiles towards a US base in Qatar , none of which hurt any Americans. In a statement, Donald Trump noted that Iran had given it an advanced warning before the attack, which explains why Qatar paused all air travel in the country before the attack. Therefore, while the missile attacks between Israel and Iran may continue, it is likely that further escalation will end. This explains why the crude oil price has crashed, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) falling to $68 and $66, respectively. Read more: Asian markets open: stocks rise after Iran-Israel ceasefire news; Sensex to open higher Dovish Federal Reserve statements Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in a strong bull run because of recent dovish Federal Reserve statements. In a statement to CNBC on Friday, Christopher Waller noted that the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation will be muted. He likely based this on recent economic numbers, which showed that the headline consumer inflation rose from 2.3% in April to 2.4% in May, lower than the median estimate of 2.5%. Therefore, Waller said that he will support cutting interest rates as early as in July. He said : “We could do this as early as July. I think we’ve got room to bring it down, and then we can kind of see what happens with inflation. We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far the data has been fine.” In a separate statement on Monday, Michele Bowman, another Fed official, said : “Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market.” Bitcoin and other altcoins thrive when the Federal Reserve has embraced an easy money policy stance. Therefore, traders will pay a close attention to the upcoming Jerome Powell testimony in Congress in which he will hint on when to expect an interest rate cut. Bitcoin ETF demand continues Meanwhile, third-party data shows that Bitcoin demand continues rising. For example, spot Bitcoin ETFs added over $350 million on Monday even as geopolitical risks remained. This addition brought the total cumulative inflows to over $47 billion. The rising demand for Bitcoin comes at a time when the supply of these coins on exchanges has continued to fall this year. Data shows that this supply has plunged from over 1.5 million earlier this year to 1.1 million today. The demand is coupled by the fact that Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, which often leads to more gains. Bitcoin price chart The risk, however, is that the ongoing Bitcoin and altcoins surge is part of a dead-cat bounce. A DCB is usually a brief comeback of a cryptocurrency that is followed by further downside.
