2025-06-24T16:55:57,"Here’s When the ‘Real Altseason’ Will Begin, According to Closely Followed Crypto Analyst","A closely followed crypto analyst says that once a key Bitcoin ( BTC ) metric reverses, altcoins may print explosive rallies. Crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may enter a downward phase after hitting a historic peak level, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. “BTC dominance: if history repeats, the real altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin dominance rejects from 71% (red).” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC.D is a metric that calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are printing gains faster than BTC. The analyst also says BTC.D may not hit exactly 71% before reversing, but somewhere within that area. “There really is no point in arguing about whether BTC.D will ultimately top out at 71% or at 69% or at 67%. The majority of the Bitcoin dominance macro uptrend has already taken place. And just like in every BTC.D cycle, it got close to 71%.” Lastly, the analyst says that as BTC.D rises to its peak, altcoins won’t completely collapse in value, but may have significant corrections before the altseason begins. “This past February, Bitcoin dominance rallied from 58% to 64%. That’s a 6% increase. Now, Bitcoin dominance is only [5.7%] away from 71%. Altcoins won’t go to $0.00. Instead, [alts] may react similarly to February 2025.” Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 65.30%.

2025-06-24T16:55:29,"Dogwifhat Rockets 20% as Bitcoin Breaches $106K – Is a $1.00 Breakout Next?","Dogwifhat ($WIF) has rocketed 20% in 24 hours, punching past $0.86 as Bitcoin smashes $106K—putting the Solana meme coin within striking distance of the $1.00 milestone. The gains follow a sharp reversal from $WIF’s recent lows below $0.72, fueled by a 22% spike in active wallets and over $70M in daily volume. Analysts now watch the $0.83 support level, with a breakout potentially igniting a broader Solana meme coin rally. Market Position and Ecosystem Developments The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a strong resurgence, with $WIF maintaining a strong position. Currently ranked as the 45th-largest digital asset by market capitalization (~$1.76B), it trails giants like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) but continues to outpace competitors such as $FLOKI, $PEPE, and $BONK in terms of trading volume and visibility. wif just woke up from hibernation +up 24.1% today mcap: $865M 24h volume: $719M still the dog with the hat still barkin’ louder than the rest pic.twitter.com/RGJzSIJRBO — madmix (@madmixnum) June 24, 2025 The past 48 hours have seen particularly strong network activity, with daily trading volume surpassing $700 million and a 22% increase in active wallets interacting with $WIF liquidity pools. The project’s ecosystem continues to expand through strategic partnerships and integrations. Since its November 2024 listing on Robinhood, $WIF has gained improved accessibility for retail traders. Community Strength and Future Outlook The community engagement around $WIF sets it apart in the crowded meme coin space. While many meme coins rise and fall with the whims of internet hype, $WIF has shown an impressive ability to stay put, owing to a community that’s as creative as it is committed. Instead of being driven by a central team, $WIF’s momentum comes from the grassroots: token holders have come together to fund everything from eye-catching billboards to exclusive merch drops, all in the name of spreading the word and having fun. Looking ahead, $WIF’s journey will depend on a few key factors. Its price action is closely linked to Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $106,000 and the ongoing strength of the Solana ecosystem. Any new exchange listings or partnership news could give $WIF an extra boost, while shifts in social chatter and trading volume will offer important hints about whether this rally is built to last. Even with a promising technical setup, savvy traders know that meme coins are never a sure thing—volatility is part of the game. That’s why smart risk management is as important as optimism, especially when the market feels bullish. All eyes will be on $WIF in the coming week. If it can hold its current ground, a push toward the $1.00 mark could be in the cards—a move that would almost certainly turn heads and spark even more excitement around this community-driven coin. Technical Breakout Points to Further Potential The current price action reveals a compelling technical story for $WIF. The coin has successfully broken out from a descending wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic bullish reversal formation that has developed over the past week. Source: TradingView This breakout was confirmed when $WIF decisively cleared the $0.83 resistance level, accompanied by increased trading volume that lends credibility to the move. The Relative Strength Index, while rising, remains comfortably below overbought territory at 62, suggesting there is still room for upward movement before the asset becomes technically extended. $WIF | @dogwifcoin Holding the 0.702 Fib…For Now One Last Shakeout Likely Moon-Shot Loading pic.twitter.com/WSOn51xcYM — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) June 23, 2025 Looking at key price levels, traders are now watching the $0.91 mark, representing a Fibonacci retracement level from June’s price action, followed by the psychologically key $1.00 threshold. The measured move from the wedge pattern’s breakout point suggests potential for $WIF to test these levels in the near term . However, should the price fail to maintain its footing above $0.83, we could see a retest of support levels at $0.78 or even a return to the $0.72 base that marked recent lows.

Useless Coin ( USELESS ), a meme coin on Solana ( SOL ), jumped to a high of $0.1462, up by 2,470% from its lowest point this month. This surge has pushed its market cap to over $133 million. The token surge accelerated as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins rose following Israel’s truce with Iran. It also jumped after two Fed officials, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, said that they would support an interest rate cut of 0.25% in the July meeting. Nansen data shows that whales have continued accumulating the token this week. Their holdings rose by 15% in the last 30 days to 381 million. Whale holdings are among the most popular bullish signals, as these investors are seen as more experienced than retail traders. You might also like: Monero price approaching $269 support: is this a setup for a major rally? Additional data shows that exchange balances of the Useless token have dropped by 13% in the last 30 days to 51.4 million. Useless Coin’s price is also rising likely due to Fear of Missing Out among retail investors. It’s common for newly launched tokens to rally as investors speculate it might be the next big thing. In most cases, however, these surges are short-lived, with tokens often pulling back as early investors take profits. A notable example is Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which surged in its early days in January before plunging. Useless Coin price technical analysis Useless Coin chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that Useless Coin has been in a strong bull run over the past few weeks. It has climbed from a low of $0.00546 in June to a high of $0.1462. The token has rallied above both the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages. It has also broken above the upper side of an ascending channel. Useless Coin’s Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator have both moved into overbought territory. Therefore, the token could see a pullback in the coming days and retest the psychological level at $0.10.

The partners will create a bridge to connect legacy payment rails with on-chain DeFi transactions. Chainlink Opens Door For Millions to Buy Crypto According to the release, the deal will be conducted with the collaboration of zerohash, Swapper Finance, Shift4 Payments, and XSwap. The partners will use the Uniswap protocol to settle the payments allowing over 3 billion cardholders to directly buy crypto from a fully decentralized platform. The press release claims: This breakthrough is powered by Chainlink’s secure interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s trusted global payments network, removing long-standing barriers that have kept mainstream users from accessing the onchain economy. While one of the partners, zerohash, will provide liquidity and onchain services to settle the legacy payments into the Uniswap smart contract; the others, Shift4 Payments, Swapper Finance, and XSwap, will provide a ‘next generation app experience.’ Part of the Chainlink ecosystem, XSwap uses this protocol’s standard for data and interoperability, the release continues, to provide core compliance, custody, and transaction infrastructure. In that way, it is easy for the cardholders to convert fiat into crypto without the usual barriers between the two sectors. Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, stated the following while thanking the Mastercard team for their ‘innovative implementation’ and the rest of the partners for achieving a ‘complex’ task in collaboration with the Chainlink community: This is the type of traditional finance and decentralized finance convergence that Chainlink was built to make possible. I’m excited about Chainlink’s ability to enable this critical connection between the traditional payments world and the over three billion cardholders in the Mastercard user base, directly into the next generation trading environments of onchain decentralized exchanges (…). People Want to Buy Crypto With Ease On the other hand, Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president, Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard, believes that the product will satisfy a demand from the cardholders allowing them to connect to the crypto market with ease. The collaboration with Mastercard will ‘unlock’ bridge between crypto users, including merchants, and potentially boost the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Drew Turchin, Head of Business Development at Uniswap Labs also added: The Uniswap protocol has become foundational for onchain markets, enabling developers around the world to build new tools for a wide range of users. It’s exciting to see this Swapper leverage the protocol and is another great example of how the protocol continues to serve as critical infrastructure in the financial stack.

2025-06-24T16:40:08,"Expert Decodes Ripple Co-founder’s Message to the XRP Community","Arthur Britto, one of the elusive co-founders of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), stunned the crypto world by breaking a 14-year silence with a single post on X—an emoji: . Though minimal, this gesture has sparked widespread interpretation, particularly by prominent influencer Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem. Her analysis suggests Britto’s post may be a deliberate signal of support for Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin investor now facing legal battles. The implications are profound, tying together Ripple’s history, founding vision, and the current state of crypto justice. Arthur Britto: The Silent Visionary Arthur Britto is famously private. He has never granted interviews, has no known public images, and follows only two accounts on X: Ripple Custody CEO Jack McDonald and Roger Ver. His most notable public commentary dates back to 2013, when he described XRP as “the plumbing you don’t see,” suggesting it was designed to work silently in the background. Though I may be mistaken, I believe @ahbritto ’s use of the no mouth emoji signals a very noteworthy point. Arthur, who follows only @_JackMcDonald_ and @rogerkver , seems to underscore Roger’s current struggle. Jack led his groundbreaking technology alongside @JoelKatz , while… pic.twitter.com/bSZTtR6Sz9 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 24, 2025 Given this long-standing silence, Britto’s recent emoji post carries significant weight. Crypto Eri’s interpretation of the “no mouth” emoji is that it reflects silence, censorship, or suppressed truth, a potential nod to Roger Ver’s current struggle. Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Roger Ver, once dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus,” played a key role in Ripple’s early development. He was one of its first investors, providing critical funding that helped launch the XRPL in 2012. Today, he faces serious legal trouble. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged him with tax evasion and mail fraud, alleging he failed to pay nearly $48 million in exit taxes after renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014. Ver was arrested in Spain in April 2024 and now faces possible extradition. His supporters argue that the charges are politically motivated and that the government is targeting him for his libertarian beliefs and outspoken stance against U.S. financial oversight. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Symbol Ripple CTO David Schwartz has also spoken out in defense of Ver, stating the case is “way more evil than most people realize.” He emphasized Ver’s integrity and his vital role in both Bitcoin and Ripple’s early days. Now, Britto’s silent post appears to reinforce that sentiment. Crypto Eri’s commentary highlights the deeper meaning behind the emoji. She compares the situation to the campaign for Ross Ulbricht’s release, suggesting the crypto community should rally similarly behind Roger Ver. Britto, through his rare appearance, may be encouraging that same sense of solidarity. The Bigger Message Britto’s post is more than just a cryptic emoji; it is a powerful, silent protest. As one of Ripple’s founding minds, his subtle gesture echoes a call for justice and fair treatment, not just for Roger Ver, but for any individual caught at the intersection of innovation and regulation. Crypto Eri’s interpretation resonates deeply across the XRP community. In a space where symbols often speak louder than words, Britto’s emoji may stand as one of the clearest statements yet: fairness matters, and the community must remain vigilant. In the end, the message is clear—even the quietest voices can carry the loudest truths. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-24T16:30:17,"Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000?","Ethereum’s price action in the past 24 hours has been characterized by a fall toward $2,100 before rebounding to the upside very quickly. Ethereum’s price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum’s next major target around $6,000. Wave A Complete, But Downside Likely Before Rally The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum’s price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets Now that the Wave A pattern is complete, the prediction is a short-term bounce to as high as $2,792 as part of a wave B retracement. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. This level is what the analyst refers to as his “ideal buy zone” for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete. Wyckoff Structure Points $6,000 ETH Price Merlijn, a popular analyst on X, shared a contrasting yet converging perspective. In this case, the analyst’s outlook is based on Wyckoff’s accumulation framework. Merlijn stated, “Ethereum: Wyckoff says go.” Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to the daily price chart that followed his analysis, the analyst showed that the crypto had already completed the spring and test phases, which are both components of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. What comes next, according to the Wyckoff method, is the markup phase. The chart Merlijn posted aligns with this outlook. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in. Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,420, up by 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-24T16:23:09,"Analyst sets new date when Bitcoin will hit $130,000","With Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaiming the $105,000 level, a trading expert is projecting the cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 within weeks. The forecast follows Bitcoin’s rebound from its one-day Exponential Moving Average 100 (EMA), a key trend line that has historically marked the beginning of major bull runs, according to a June 24 TradingView analysis by TradingShot . The rebound also coincided with a de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two nations. Technically, the EMA100 has served as a critical support level since Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022. Since then, each major rally has either originated from or touched this moving average, triggering strong upward moves. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin dipped slightly below the EMA100 in the first bullish wave before rallying to the 1.382 Fibonacci extension . The second wave bounced directly off the EMA100 and reached the 1.618 level. In the third leg, the price came close to the trend line before surging toward the 2.0 Fibonacci extension. Bitcoin is forming a fourth bullish channel, mirroring the previous patterns. TradingShot noted that each rally has produced progressively higher Fibonacci peaks, suggesting the current move could surpass the 2.0 level of around $168,000. However, the analysis offers a more conservative near-term target of $130,000, aligned with the 1.382 Fibonacci extension, which could be reached by early August 2025. Bitcoin FUD moment Meanwhile, a similar analysis by Ted Pillows, shared in an X post on June 24, suggests that Bitcoin’s current price behavior indicates every major Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) event has historically marked the asset’s bottom, often preceding strong recoveries. Key events such as the 2023 Silvergate liquidity scare, the 2022 FTX collapse, the 2024 Japan Carry Trade unwind, Trump’s tariff announcement, and the recent U.S.-Iran conflict have all aligned with significant price lows. Pillows noted that with signs of de-escalation in global tensions, especially the recent ceasefire, Bitcoin may have already reached its bottom or is nearing it. https://twitter.com/TedPillows/status/1937480575079841965 Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,490, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours, while in the past week, the asset 1.1%.

2025-06-24T16:15:48,"Bitcoin Mining Profitability Records Almost 20% Spike: Report","According to a Jefferies report, Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability reportedly recorded almost a 20% uptick. This surge coincided with a nearly equal spike in the price of flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin and a modest gain in the network hashrate. BTC Price Increases as Gold Price Spikes On Monday, investment firm Jefferies published a research report detailing Bitcoin mining progress. BTC mining profitability rose by 18.2% in May while the network hashrate gained 3.5%. This hashrate is the collective computational power used to mine and process transactions on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain like Bitcoin. Apart from the increase in hashrate, which serves as a proxy for competition amongst miners, Bitcoin price registered some profits, spurred by the recent rally in gold price . For context, investors turned to inflation-protected assets with the spike in gold prices. According to Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul, analysts from Jeffries, this move was in anticipation of a ballooning fiscal deficit in the United States, amongst other countries. MARA Holdings and CleanSpark Leads US-listed Mining Companies Jeffries’ report also listed the volume of Bitcoin mined by US mining companies last month. All the US-listed mining facilities mined a total of 3,754 BTC. According to the report, this is a notable increase compared to April, when they only mined 3,278 BTC. On the other hand, miners in North America made up 26.3% of the total network in May, compared to 24.1% the previous month. Out of this group, MARA Holdings (MARA) mined 950 Bitcoin, marking a 35% increase from April. It has successfully raised its total reserves to 49,179 BTC. It was followed by CleanSpark (CLSK) at 694 mined Bitcoin. It is worth noting that MARA’s hashrate is still the largest at 58.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Records Slight Decline Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty has recorded a slight decline following a record high. This outlook offers some relief to miners, especially those who are dealing with rising costs and reduced block rewards. In mid-June, CryptoQuant shared data showing that the mining difficulty stood at around 126.4 trillion. This was just below the All-Time High (ATH) of 126.9 trillion recorded on May 31. Mining difficulty adjusts every two weeks to ensure that new blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. This is regardless of how much computing power is in the network. Therefore, the new mining difficulty record is expected in a few days.

2025-06-24T16:13:54,"Japan’s FSA proposes classifying cryptocurrencies as financial products","Regulators in Japan want to reclassify the legal status of cryptocurrencies as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The proposal , introduced by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on June 24, is part of a broader push to align the country’s financial system with its “New Capitalism” strategy, which aims to transform Japan into a more investment-driven economy. Under the proposed changes, cryptocurrencies would move from the existing regulatory scope of the Payment Services Act to the more comprehensive Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), the same framework that governs securities and traditional financial products. If adopted, this would allow for the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan and reduce the capital gains tax on crypto from a rate of up to 55% to a flat 20%, putting it in line with taxation on stock investments. Among other provisions are plans to establish a dedicated working group to examine the proposed reclassification and oversee regulatory developments. In the policy document, the FSA has highlighted how crypto adoption in the country has seen a noticeable uptick over the past years. As of January 2025, over 12.1 million domestic crypto accounts were active, and crypto holdings on platforms exceeded 5 trillion yen (approximately $34 billion). The FSA said that crypto ownership has outpaced participation in traditional instruments such as FX trading and corporate bonds, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. With this proposal, Japan hopes to catch up with the progress made across leading economies like the United States, where Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products have seen great success. Citing data from March 2025, the FSA pointed to more than 1,200 financial institutions, including U.S. pension funds and Goldman Sachs, now holding U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. Japan advances crypto regulations Before unveiling its June proposal, FSA had already moved to redefine crypto through a draft framework categorising tokens by function and structure. At the time, the FSA proposed classifying tokens based on their economic role and governance model, separating fundraising assets, labeled Type 1, from decentralized, non-fundraising tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, now referred to as Type 2. Japanese regulators have warmed up to the crypto sector over the past years, and there have been growing calls within policymaking circles to recognise digital assets as a legitimate component of the financial system. The Bank of Japan, for instance, has warned that in a highly digitized society, trust in fiat currency could erode if central banks fail to ensure price stability. According to Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida, in such scenarios, cryptocurrencies or stablecoins could eventually fill the gap, posing a credible alternative to sovereign money in the eyes of future generations.

2025-06-24T16:11:59,"Metaplanet Hits 11,111 BTC Milestone — Follow the Smart Money Into These Crypto Assets","Metaplanet’s milestone of acquiring 11,111 BTC is more than just a number—it’s a signal that institutional conviction in crypto remains strong. As major players quietly accumulate, savvy investors are scanning the horizon for undervalued assets with breakout potential. In this article, we spotlight three crypto projects that mirror the “smart money” logic: fundamentally solid, technically oversold, and primed for explosive upside once momentum shifts. Worldcoin (WLD): Oversold and Ready for a Reversal? Source: tradingview Worldcoin is currently trading between $0.73 and $0.98, reflecting sustained downward pressure—but also creating a potential entry zone for bold investors. While the coin is down over 34% this past month and nearly 60% across six months, the RSI is starting to hint at early buyer interest. A breakout above the $1.13 resistance could trigger a rally toward $1.38, offering a gain of nearly 40% from current levels. As Worldcoin continues pushing its identity-based crypto vision and gains media visibility, a momentum shift could quickly flip the narrative. Oversold assets often make the loudest comebacks—and WLD might just be setting the stage. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): AI Sector Favorite Eyes Next Leg Up Source: tradingview FET is currently trading between $0.51 and $0.70, showing consolidation after a prolonged pullback. Although down over 20% this month and nearly 50% over six months, the RSI at 58 suggests mild bullish momentum building. A push past $0.82 resistance could unlock a move toward $1.01, offering potential upside of up to 60%. As AI continues to dominate both tech and crypto narratives, FET stands out as a leader in decentralized superintelligence. For investors tracking ""smart money"" sectors, AI tokens like FET remain at the top of the watchlist. Ethena (ENA): Deep Discount with High-Reward Potential Source: tradingview Ethena is hovering in a tight band between $0.20 and $0.30 after dropping more than 70% over six months—but this might present a strong accumulation zone. The RSI remains low, hinting at oversold conditions and growing buyer interest. A breakout past $0.35 could spark a rally to $0.45, representing a 50% upside from current prices. As a synthetic dollar project with strong fundamentals and a growing DeFi presence, ENA could be poised for a sharp recovery when market sentiment turns. For those who follow big-picture fundamentals, this may be a low-risk, high-reward setup. Conclusion While Metaplanet sets the tone with bold Bitcoin accumulation, the real alpha may lie in assets still flying under the radar. Worldcoin, FET, and Ethena each offer compelling setups—steep discounts, improving indicators, and alignment with major crypto narratives like AI, identity, and DeFi. As the market shifts from fear to opportunity, these tokens could be next in line for aggressive moves. Smart money isn’t just watching Bitcoin—it’s hunting for the next breakout story.

2025-06-24T16:05:07,"What Tariffs Will — and Won’t — Change for U.S. Bitcoin Miners","Will tariffs end the golden age of bitcoin mining in America? After China banned crypto in the summer of 2021, a huge chunk of the mining industry was forced to relocate — to Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada and other countries with cheap electricity. The biggest beneficiary of this exodus, however, was the United States, which over the last four years has overtaken every other country in the world in terms of hashrate (meaning that more bitcoin is produced in the U.S. than anywhere else). Yet President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, unveiled on April 2 but paused for the time being, threaten to increase the costs of ASICs , the extremely powerful computers used to produce bitcoin. Only a handful of companies know how to build these ASICs, and the majority of their manufacturing facilities are located in Southeast Asia, in nations that face roughly 10% to 50% tariffs. While the new taxes probably won’t make it prohibitively expensive for U.S.-based miners to import new machines, they will likely slow down the industry’s expansion in the country, multiple experts told CoinDesk. “The U.S. is still going to be the major source of hashrate globally for the foreseeable future, but its overarching dominance will likely erode as bitcoin mining becomes a much more global business,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Synteq Digital. “We're certainly going to see U.S. hashrate plateau in terms of relative growth,” he added. “Other countries are coming into the space in a big way. Pakistan just announced it will dedicate two gigawatts of power to bitcoin mining. There are all sorts of projects happening in Ethiopia and abroad. They will certainly take up quite a bit of hashrate capacity growth.” Tariffs are only a piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, such as the enormous demand for new data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and the diminishing number of ideal U.S. locations for firms to set up mining facilities, are likely to have a larger impact on a miner’s calculations when it comes to choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate. U.S.-based operations are still, in the short-term, able to tap into a robust secondary market in order to acquire mining rigs without paying tariffs. In the long-term, ASIC manufacturers are taking steps to produce their machines on U.S. soil. The consensus seems to be that, far from destroying bitcoin mining in the U.S., tariffs are simply shaping up to be a new variable that the quick-moving, hyper-competitive industry has to contend with. Biting the bullet Tariffs mostly presented a challenge to miners in April because of how sudden and steep they were. Miners and logistics companies rushed to push ASIC shipments into the U.S. before the policy’s implementation in order to avoid paying substantial taxes — only for the White House to push the deadline back a few months. Now, however, mining firms have adapted to the idea that imported ASICs will cost at least 10% more than they used to. But there is uncertainty as to whether this is the new normal. The Trump administration is still in the midst of trade negotiations, and the court system has yet to provide a definite ruling on the lawfulness of its new policies. “It’s likely going to take a long time for us to have a definitive answer on what tariffs will look like — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in,” Lauren Lin, head of hardware at bitcoin hardware firm Luxor Technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We expect it to take a few months, even over a year.” In the meantime, Luxor (which also runs a freight-forwarding business) isn’t seeing any signs of panic among its clients, though there has been an uptick in questions on how to prepare for Washington’s policy changes, according to Lin. Nor is the ASIC secondary market (where U.S.-based firms can acquire pre-owned, cheaper machines) slowing down, she said. In other words, miners are plodding along. But there are new difficulties, like the fact that tariffs also impact imported electrical hardware. Transformers, for example, are mostly manufactured overseas and were already difficult to obtain before April. Tariffs have only worsened the situation. This has been a bigger source of frustration for miners than tariffs on ASICs, according to an individual who works for a crypto trade organization. Overall, the White House’s initial tariffs on Southeast Asian nations should only be seen as a starting point for a policy that will likely evolve over time, Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at bitcoin miner Bitdeer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We're pretty optimistic that there'll be a reasonable outcome at the end of this,” he said. Made in America The $30 billion ASIC market is dominated by Bitmain, a Chinese firm whose machines power roughly 80% of Bitcoin’s hashrate , according to TheMinerMag. Its competitors include MicroBT, Canaan and Bitdeer. These companies manufacture the vast majority of their ASICs in Malaysia, Thailand and China, though MicroBT already has at least one facility in Pennsylvania, and Bitmain announced in December that it was launching a new production line in the United States. Canaan has also completed a U.S. trial run, meaning that it now has the capacity to build ASICs in the country if it chooses to. The Trump administration’s tariffs are accomplishing one of their stated objectives (to boost U.S. industry) in that they’re incentivizing these ASIC manufacturers to scale up their operations in the country. Canaan told CoinDesk that, while production in the U.S. is costly, it brings the advantages of being geographically closer to their customers and of reducing supply chain risks. The firm said that it is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with existing U.S.-based manufacturers for its own purposes. MicroBT is also looking into ways to avoid tariffs by ramping up U.S. production. Bitdeer, a new but technologically advanced player in the ASIC scene , is looking at the situation as an opportunity to seize market share from the incumbents. “We'd like to migrate as much as we can to the U.S.,” LaBerge said. “It will take some time to ramp that up.” “Being a manufacturer and a miner gives us tremendous optionality, because we'll always have a home for the rigs that we produce, whether it's in our own data centers or with a third party,” he added. Bitdeer has mining operations in Texas and Ohio, among other locations. The heavyweight, Bitmain, has not communicated new plans to ramp up U.S. production since tariffs were announced in April. But the company will likely want to demonstrate that it’s building in the U.S. in accordance with the Trump administration’s goals, Synteq’s Kulyk said. Bitmain did not respond to a request for comment. In any case, the consensus seems to be that expanding production capacity in the U.S. will be a slow and costly process. “Whether we scale our machine manufacturing in the U.S. depends on our ability to cut costs as well as demand from our U.S. customers. If demand from U.S. customers is low, manufacturing here doesn't make sense,” Canaan told CoinDesk. “In addition, if tariffs on products from Southeast Asia [end up being] low, then we don't necessarily need to build up our manufacturing capabilities in the United States.” The end of a golden age? So miners are quickly adapting to the new reality of tariffs, and ASIC manufacturers look ready to ramp up local production. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s U.S.-based hashrate ( currently worth over 40% of global hashrate ) is unlikely to keep growing as fast as it has in the last four years. For one thing, tariffs do have an impact. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and companies are always looking for ways to cut costs. If the choice is between opening a new mining facility in Texas or in Ontario, tariffs may swing the decision in favour of the latter. More important, however, is the fact that it’s getting harder to find new U.S. locations that meet the necessary requirements for spinning up new bitcoin mining operations. “Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked in the U.S.,” LaBerge said. Not to mention that competition has become more intense. Data centers dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) are popping up all over the country in order to scale AI capabilities, and the industry’s major players — Microsoft, Meta, Google — are deep-pocketed. If a site is suitable for both mining and HPC, the miners are unlikely to win a bidding war. Nor would they necessarily want to. HPC data centers are more complex and capital intensive to build , but they also bring in much higher profits; this has led a number of bitcoin mining firms to diversify into AI. “HPC chasing electrons is the main theme for the next two to 10 years,” Kulyk told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin miners most certainly have targets on their backs for acquisition and consolidation in the space… As a sector, they will likely get eaten or absorbed into overall digital compute.” This phenomenon is likely to stay contained to the U.S. because of the technical sophistication required to build and run HPC centers. Political considerations also play a big part, considering the ongoing AI arms race between the U.S. and China. In other words, bitcoin miners outside of the U.S. won’t be impacted by the rapid growth of the HPC industry the same way. For U.S.-based miners, the path forward may no longer be expanding in terms of megawatts, but in terms of efficiency, according to LaBerge. “If you look at the global hashrate right now… the majority of rigs have an efficiency of 30 joules per terahash (J/TH) or higher,” he said. For comparison, Bitmain and Bitdeer’s latest generation machines are closer to 10 J/TH in efficiency. “In today’s economics, that’s marginally profitable at best.” “All of those rigs need to be refreshed,” he continued. “We see this as a $4-6 billion a year addressable market for the next three to five years.” CORRECTION (June 24, 2025, 16:30 UTC): Canaan isn't looking into building its own U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, as previously stated by the article, but is mulling the idea of partnering with existing U.S. manufacturers.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/06/24/what-tariffs-will-and-wont-change-for-us-bitcoin-miners,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News Analysis|Bitcoin Mining|ASIC|Exclusive|Feature",cryptocompare

After these approvals, ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL) are also expected to be approved. While the ETF movement in the USA has become an example for other countries, Japan has also opened the doors to ETFs. Japan's Financial Services Agency has published a proposal today to include cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, local news agency Coinpost reported. At this point, the proposal proposes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin be recognized as “financial products” under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which regulates securities and traditional financial products. The proposal, which will be reviewed by the Financial System Council tomorrow, June 25, could pave the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs in Japan and allow crypto gains to be taxed at a flat 20% rate instead of the current graduated tax rate of up to 55%. It was stated that this change could make BTC and crypto investments more attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Finally, experts predict that if the proposal submitted in Japan is accepted and cryptocurrencies are treated as a financial product, it will pave the way for regulated crypto investment vehicles. It was stated that this could mean that spot Bitcoin ETFs, something that Japan has been holding back for years, could finally get approval. *This is not investment advice.

Its association with Ripple Labs and its institutional focus gave it a unique positioning in the market. But in 2025, the conversation is shifting. Crypto insiders, influencers, and developers are now turning their attention to Bitcoin Solaris. Why? Because what XRP once represented—low-cost, scalable finance—BTC-S is now executing with stronger technology, deeper decentralization, and actual wealth creation potential. In the race toward the next wave of generational crypto wealth, Bitcoin Solaris is no longer an alternative. It’s becoming the main path forward. XRP’s Legacy and Its Limit There’s no denying XRP played a significant role in bringing blockchain to financial institutions. Its speed and cost-efficiency were ahead of their time. But today, innovation moves faster than regulation. XRP is still navigating legal turbulence and battling for utility adoption outside centralized banking. Meanwhile, the crypto world is evolving in a direction that values openness, mobility, and grassroots scalability—precisely where Bitcoin Solaris thrives. XRP is still a good investment to some.

Less than 24 hours after revealing a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp.

The purchase kicks off a treasury program that could swell to $1 billion in bitcoin once the SPAC transaction closes and the combined company, to be called ProCap Financial, lists on Nasdaq. It comes after the company revealed it raised $550 million through a preferred equity offering and an additional $225 million in convertible notes. If the company was already publicly traded, it would rank as the 14th biggest BTC holder among listed companies, just below Semler Scientific, according to Bitcointreasuries.com.

2025-06-24T15:36:37,"Pompliano’s ProCap SPAC Aims for $1B Bitcoin Treasury Splash","Crypto investor and podcast host Anthony Pompliano is taking the MicroStrategy playbook to Wall Street's next level, raising $750 million to go public with his Bitcoin-native financial platform ProCap via a SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The deal, which was announced Monday, will see ProCap Financial go public on Nasdaq with a plan to rapidly buy and hold up to $1 billion of Bitcoin—about an eighth of Michael Saylor's legendary hoard—making it among the biggest BTC treasuries to list on public markets in history. Deal Structure: How ProCap Is Going Public ProCap's route to the public markets is a conventional SPAC play with a cryptocurrency twist. The $750 million financing consists of $516.5 million in equity and $235 million of convertible notes, with U.S. Bank as collateral agent and trustee. Unusually, ProCap is investing $516.5 million to buy Bitcoin within 15 days of signing, giving investors immediate BTC exposure even before the closing of the merger. The convertible notes are 130% convertible and 2x collateralized in cash or Bitcoin, giving institutional backers downside protection. Upon merging, ProCap Financial will be led by Pompliano, offering not just a humongous Bitcoin reserve but also a series of BTC-denominated financial products—lending, trading, and capital markets—to generate yield and profits off its balance sheet. Why SPACs Are Back—And Why Crypto Loves Them SPACs, or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, are making a comeback in 2025 after a two-year absence, with the help of a better regulatory climate and a slowdown in traditional IPOs. SPACs offer crypto firms a short-cut to the public markets, sidestepping the lengthy and costly IPO route. ProCap's transaction is the largest initial raise for a publicly listed Bitcoin treasury business thus far, demonstrating Wall Street's appetites for risk and digital assets once more. The property is also a testament to the growing ”Bitcoin treasury” trend, spearheaded by MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and holding over 592,000 BTC. ProCap's $1 billion target would represent about 12.5% of Saylor's stack and be among the largest corporate BTC holders globally. Regulatory Hurdles and Listing-Day Pricing Even with the hype, the deal is under quite high regulatory scrutiny. The transaction is expected to be finalized in 2025, pending shareholder approval and SEC approval. According to experts, although the SPAC framework allows for speed, it also brings scrutiny—especially for crypto firms that are grappling with evolving custody, accounting, and reporting requirements. ProCap's hiring of U.S. Bank as collateral agent and its spot BTC buying initiative are meant to appease regulators and investors both. Valuation will be done on the final closing price of BTC bought, but with Bitcoin above $100,000, the market capitalization of ProCap can equal or even surpass some traditional financial institutions. Listing will come with the ticker $CCCM and provides shareholders with near-immediate exposure to BTC. SPACs, Bitcoin Treasuries, and Wall Street's Crypto Pivot ProCap's flashy entrance is symptomatic of a broader phenomenon: public companies vying to be ”Bitcoin proxies” for investors who would like exposure to digital currencies without the hassle of wallets or exchanges. More than 70 public companies collectively now hold over $67 billion in BTC, and 30+ new crypto treasury transactions have been announced since April. The SPAC route is specially attractive with Wall Street banks and institutional investors becoming friendly to the space and the Trump administration's light regulatory touch inviting new listings. While the SPAC renaissance and ProCap's aggressive listing have sparked the market, some experts warn against forces of a bubble and savvy risk management. ”There's an old George Soros quote: When I see a bubble, I buy,” Pompliano joked, ”because the trend works.” However, ProCap's successful listing will be contingent upon regulatory openness, timing in the markets, and learning how to generate yield from its BTC stack—something even Saylor's Strategy now attempts to accomplish. Bottom Line Pompliano's ProCap SPAC is a landmark for Bitcoin public market adoption and the return of SPACs to Wall Street's main stage. With $750 million in capital and a $1 billion BTC target, ProCap stands poised to raise the bar for corporate crypto treasuries—if it can clear the regulatory hurdle and fulfill its bold vision.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9690/pompliano-s-pro-cap-spac-aims-for-1-b-bitcoin-treasury-splash,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T15:26:34,"CZ hypes ‘BNB MicroStrategy’ as corporate reserve interest grows","Former Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao is cheering the growing institutional spotlight on BNB as more firms move to tap the token as a reserve asset. In a July 24 X post, Zhao praised China-based Labs cryptocurrency-mining chip designer Nano Labs for its vision to launch a BNB ( BNB ) focused strategic reserve. The Binance founder’s applause follows Nano Labs’ announcement earlier that day of a $500 million convertible note raise, with plans to acquire up to $1 billion worth of BNB over time. According to the company, it aims to hold 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply and position the token as a long-term treasury asset. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1937468397891256476 While CZ clarified that neither he nor any affiliated entities took part in the raise, he described the move as a major vote of confidence for BNB’s future and expressed support for the vision. You might also like: BNB flashes a golden cross as DEX volume soars ahead of Maxwell upgrade The comments build on his previous nod to a similar initiative. Former Coral Capital Holdings executives were recently reported to be raising $100 million through a Nasdaq-listed entity to accumulate BNB as part of a similar institutional reserve strategy. “BNB ‘MicroStrategy’ coming to a company near you!” cheered the Binance founder. He further emphasized that more institutions around the world are mulling the same idea, adding that the rising interest may soon mark a turning point for the token. A new narrative for BNB? Institutional adoption played a defining role in Bitcoin’s rise, and a similar wave of interest may now be forming around BNB. Still, doubts remain. Although BNB is described as a public, blockchain-native token not affiliated with Binance, its ties to the exchange have long weighed on its image. This is largely due to the exchange’s regulatory troubles and lingering concerns about the token’s distribution and decentralization, fueling investor skepticism. That cautious sentiment is reflected in BNB’s stunted growth over the past year, lagging behind many of its peers in both performance and market enthusiasm. However, some believe that the recent wave of institutional interest could promote adoption, helping it carve out an identity beyond Binance’s shadow.

2025-06-24T15:20:28,"Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Shift: Ending ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision","BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Shift: Ending ‘Reputational Risk’ in Bank Supervision The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant development that could reshape how digital asset firms interact with traditional banking. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, has just made a pivotal announcement: it will no longer consider “reputational risk” as a standalone factor in its bank supervision guidelines. This move, initially brought to light by Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a profound shift, particularly for crypto firms that have long struggled with banking access. Understanding the Shift in Federal Reserve Guidelines For years, the term “reputational risk” has been a contentious point in the banking sector, especially concerning businesses deemed “high-risk” or “novel” – a category into which many cryptocurrency companies often fell. This vague classification allowed banks to deny services to crypto firms, citing potential damage to their public image, even if the firms themselves were operating legally and compliantly. This often led to the frustrating phenomenon known as “debanking.” The Federal Reserve’s decision means this subjective criterion is being removed from their official bank examination manuals. Instead, examiners will now be retrained to focus solely on concrete financial risks, such as money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing – risks that are quantifiable and can be mitigated through established compliance protocols. This change represents a crucial step towards creating a more objective and fair banking environment for all legitimate businesses, including those in the digital asset space. The Impact of Ending Reputational Risk for Crypto Firms The removal of “reputational risk” from the Fed’s lexicon is a monumental victory for the crypto industry. Historically, many legitimate crypto businesses, from exchanges to blockchain developers, found themselves shut out of traditional banking services. This wasn’t necessarily due to actual financial misconduct but rather a perception of risk or a lack of understanding from financial institutions. Increased Banking Access: This change could open doors for crypto firms that previously struggled to secure bank accounts, loans, and other essential financial services. Banks might now be more willing to engage with crypto businesses without the looming threat of regulatory scrutiny based on subjective reputational concerns. Reduced Debanking: The practice of “debanking,” where banks unilaterally terminate relationships with crypto companies, is expected to decrease. This provides much-needed stability and predictability for an industry that thrives on innovation but has been hampered by banking instability. Level Playing Field: By focusing on tangible financial risks, the Fed is helping to create a more level playing field. Crypto firms, like any other business, will now be evaluated based on their adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, rather than on their perceived “newness” or “riskiness” by association. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about legitimizing an entire sector. When crypto firms can access banking services, they can operate more efficiently, grow, and contribute more effectively to the broader economy. It’s a clear signal that regulators are moving towards integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system, albeit cautiously. How Bank Supervision is Evolving The Federal Reserve is not acting in isolation. It is the last major U.S. financial regulator to make this specific change, following in the footsteps of others like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This concerted effort across multiple regulatory bodies suggests a unified approach to modernizing bank supervision and fostering innovation responsibly. The evolution of bank supervision can be seen in several key shifts: From Subjective to Objective: Moving away from vague “reputational” concerns towards measurable financial risks. Focus on Risk Management: Emphasizing robust internal controls, compliance programs, and due diligence processes within banks. Technological Adaptation: Regulators are increasingly understanding the nuances of blockchain technology and digital assets, leading to more informed policy decisions. This evolving landscape requires banks to adapt their internal frameworks. Instead of simply avoiding crypto, they must now develop sophisticated risk assessment models that can accurately evaluate the financial crime risks associated with digital asset transactions. This encourages banks to become more knowledgeable about the crypto space, which can only benefit the ecosystem in the long run. Addressing Crypto Debanking : A Historical Perspective The issue of crypto debanking has been a persistent thorn in the side of the digital asset industry for years. Many crypto businesses, even those with strong compliance frameworks, found themselves without banking partners. This was often driven by a combination of factors: Regulatory Uncertainty: A lack of clear guidelines from regulators made banks hesitant to engage with crypto. Perceived High Risk: The nascent nature of the industry and its association with illicit activities (even if a small percentage) led to a blanket classification of “high risk.” Operational Burden: Banks found it complex and costly to implement the necessary AML/KYC procedures for crypto businesses, often opting to avoid them entirely. “Reputational Risk” Concerns: The fear that associating with crypto could damage their standing with customers or regulators was a significant deterrent. The Federal Reserve’s latest move directly addresses the fourth point, removing a major hurdle. This historical context underscores the significance of the Fed’s decision. It’s not just a minor policy tweak; it’s a direct response to years of advocacy from the crypto industry and a recognition of the need for a more balanced regulatory approach. What Does This Mean for US Financial Regulators and the Future? With the Federal Reserve now aligning with other major US financial regulators on this specific issue, there’s a clearer, more consistent message being sent to the banking industry: don’t debank legitimate businesses simply because of their industry. Instead, focus on effective risk management. This convergence among regulators bodes well for the future of crypto in the United States. It suggests a growing maturity in regulatory thinking, moving from outright avoidance or extreme caution to a more nuanced approach that seeks to integrate digital assets responsibly into the financial system. Key Takeaways for the Future: Increased Clarity: Banks can expect more consistent guidance from regulators regarding how to engage with crypto firms. Innovation Encouraged: A more stable banking environment could foster greater innovation within the crypto space, as businesses can operate with more confidence. Continued Scrutiny on Financial Risks: While “reputational risk” is out, the focus on robust AML, KYC, and anti-fraud measures will remain paramount. Crypto firms must continue to prioritize compliance. Potential for New Banking Models: This shift might encourage more traditional banks to develop specialized departments or services tailored for crypto businesses. The path forward won’t be without its challenges. Banks will need to invest in training, technology, and expertise to properly assess and manage the financial risks associated with crypto. However, the regulatory landscape is undeniably shifting towards greater acceptance and integration. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the Fed’s decision is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain. Banks will still need to overcome their own internal biases and invest in the necessary infrastructure to serve crypto clients compliantly. For crypto firms, the onus remains on demonstrating impeccable compliance and transparency. Opportunities: Growth of Crypto-Friendly Banks: We may see an increase in the number of banks willing to serve crypto businesses, potentially leading to more competitive services. Mainstream Adoption: Easier banking access could accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Regulatory Certainty: This move contributes to a broader trend of increasing regulatory clarity, which is crucial for industry growth. Challenges: Bank Reluctance: Some banks may still be hesitant due to a lack of understanding or existing risk aversion, even without the “reputational risk” clause. Compliance Costs: Implementing robust AML/KYC for crypto remains complex and potentially costly for banks. Evolving Threats: The crypto landscape is dynamic, and new financial crime risks can emerge, requiring continuous adaptation from both banks and regulators. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses and Banks For crypto firms, this is a call to double down on compliance. While a major hurdle has been removed, the expectation for robust AML/KYC frameworks remains. Banks, on the other hand, should view this as an opportunity to expand their client base and adapt to the evolving financial landscape. For Crypto Firms: Strengthen Compliance: Ensure your AML, KYC, and anti-fraud programs are top-notch and demonstrable. Educate Banks: Be prepared to educate potential banking partners about your operations and compliance measures. Seek Proactive Engagement: Reach out to banks that are showing signs of openness to the crypto sector. For Banks: Invest in Expertise: Train staff on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and associated financial crime risks. Develop Tailored Solutions: Consider creating specific banking products and services for the digital asset industry. Review Risk Frameworks: Update internal risk assessment models to align with the Fed’s new guidance, focusing on tangible financial risks. The Federal Reserve’s decision to remove “reputational risk” from its bank supervision guidelines marks a truly transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that legitimate crypto firms deserve fair access to banking services, judged on concrete financial risks rather than subjective perceptions. This move, aligning the Fed with other major U.S. regulators, paves the way for a more integrated, stable, and innovative financial ecosystem. While challenges remain, the path forward for crypto-traditional finance collaboration looks significantly brighter. This isn’t just about policy; it’s about fostering an environment where innovation can truly thrive without unnecessary barriers.

2025-06-24T15:10:54,"Dogecoin Bounces 12% After Weekend Crash but Faces Resistance","The apex meme coin witnessed this decline over the weekend due to global macro uncertainty, fueled by escalating geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. What’s in Store for Dogecoin? Market analyst Crypto Master believes that Dogecoin is staring at a strong reversal signal, having witnessed a 25.3% drop in the past month. The analyst pointed out , “DOGE has printed a powerful bullish candle on the 4H chart after reclaiming $0.165 support. A breakout above the $0.167 resistance could ignite a new upward leg. Momentum is building up fast.” Based on this analysis, Dogecoin will have to breach major resistance at $0.167 to enhance its chances of soaring to the $0.171, $0.176, and $0.183 targets. Similar sentiments were shared by crypto analyst Tektonic that Dogecoin was gearing towards recovery if it defended a crucial support zone. Tektonic stated , “DOGE is holding firm above the $0.142–$0.16 demand zone, with bulls stepping in to defend the structure. On-chain metrics, particularly the 30-day MVRV, are signaling that a potential bottom may be in. If support holds, a price rebound could be on the horizon.” At the time of this writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1636, representing a 7.2% increase in the past 24 hours. Therefore, this shows that DOGE is inching closer to the $0.167 resistance zone, which will be pivotal in determining its next move. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase recently launched decentralized finance (DeFi) access for wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 (L2) Base network. Why a Dogecoin ETF is Deemed a Game-Changer The potential launch of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is making waves across both traditional and crypto markets. Often dubbed the “people’s crypto,” Dogecoin began as a meme but evolved into a cultural and financial phenomenon. Now, a Dogecoin ETF could mark a pivotal shift, unlocking institutional access, mainstream credibility, and massive liquidity. Mainstream Legitimacy A Dogecoin ETF would represent a crucial milestone in the coin’s journey from internet joke to legitimate financial asset. By gaining regulatory approval and listing on major stock exchanges, Dogecoin would earn recognition akin to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum—both of which saw institutional inflows soar after their respective ETF approvals. A regulated vehicle would signal to traditional investors that Dogecoin is no longer just speculative fun—it’s a viable digital asset. Increased Institutional Exposure Currently, Dogecoin’s accessibility is limited to crypto exchanges, retail wallets, and a few payment integrations. An ETF would open the floodgates to institutional capital—pension funds, asset managers, and hedge funds—many of which are restricted from directly holding crypto. This new gateway could significantly increase demand and market stability, shifting Dogecoin’s price dynamics and volatility profile. Liquidity and Volume Surge With an ETF, Dogecoin’s daily trading volume could spike, improving liquidity and reducing slippage for large trades. Greater liquidity often leads to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery, which is crucial for sophisticated investors. As we've seen with Bitcoin ETFs, increased trading volumes tend to coincide with stronger price momentum and deeper market participation. Retail Simplicity Dogecoin’s brand is heavily retail-driven, and an ETF would allow everyday investors to gain exposure through familiar brokerage platforms without handling wallets, keys, or direct crypto transactions. This simplicity could supercharge retail participation while expanding Dogecoin’s appeal to cautious newcomers. Cultural and Strategic Timing The rise of meme-driven finance and social investing trends makes the Dogecoin ETF proposal especially timely. As platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) continue to amplify community sentiment, Dogecoin’s popularity gives it an edge other altcoins lack. A Dogecoin ETF doesn’t just represent an investment product—it symbolizes the intersection of internet culture and Wall Street. Conclusion A Dogecoin ETF wouldn’t just validate the token, it could reshape the meme coin investment landscape. By bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, such a product has the potential to elevate Dogecoin from meme status to mainstream asset class. As Dogecoin stares at the major resistance zone of $0.167, it remains to be seen whether 9th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization will breach this level for sustained bullish momentum.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9689/dogecoin-bounces-12-after-weekend-crash-but-faces-resistance,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Arthur Britto Breaks His Silence Britto posted for the first time on the X social media platform on Monday for the first time since creating the account in August 2011. The cryptic post features an emoji of a face without a mouth, which typically suggests speechlessness. Some X users questioned whether his account had been compromised. However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz, Britto’s long-time collaborator, clarified that the post was real and ruled out a hacking incident. “I can confirm this was not a hack or compromise,” he noted . I can confirm this was not a hack or compromise. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 23, 2025 Britto created the decentralized, open-source XRP Ledger (XRPL) alongside Schwartz and Mt. Gox founder Jed McCaleb and launched it in 2012. He later helped add XRP, a digital asset designed for fast, low-cost global payments that serves as the native cryptocurrency of the XRPL. Britto also co-created NewCoin alongside Schwartz, McCaleb, and Chris Larsen, which was later renamed to OpenCoin before finally rebranding as Ripple. A recently leaked agreement reveals that Britto received 2% of the total supply of XRP (formerly “Ripple Credits”). However, despite his significant contribution, Britto has remained largely out of the limelight. He has never given interviews, appeared in photographs, or participated in public forums, making him one of the most mysterious figures in the crypto space, akin to the pseudonymous Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, some crypto community members think Britto is Satoshi. What Britto’s Return Could Mean For XRP Britto’s post sparked speculation among XRP fans about what his potential return could mean. Prominent commentator John Squire pointed out the Ripple co-founder’s strategic timing, asserting that it coincides with several key developments, including record on-chain volume. Speculation around Ripple’s initial public offering (IPO) prospects and pre-bull market conditions further signals a pattern. “Bullrun confirmed? Too early to say. But Arthur Britto doesn’t casually drop breadcrumbs. When someone this silent speaks… You listen,” Squire added . Others highlighted Britto’s past ambitious assertion that XRP is “designed” to be worth $10,000 per token and should scale to 8 billion users, making it the core protocol for a truly inclusive global financial system. “Perhaps a signal. XRP is reaching its moment. The global shift towards digital payments, CBDCs, and stablecoins is aligning with the original vision. The #XRPLedger is closer than ever to serving billions,” said another X user. It’s also worth mentioning that Britto’s return comes as Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission await a court ruling on their joint motion to advance the settlement process and wrap up the years-long legal drama.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/enigmatic-ripple-xrp-co-founder-resurfaces-after-14-years-of-silence-is-something-big-brewing/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|WALLET|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T15:00:13,"Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month","Ethereum has experienced significant volatility in recent days, driven largely by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. After breaking down from the range that had held since early May, ETH fell sharply to $2,100, triggering widespread concern among investors. The breakdown was largely attributed to the market’s reaction to the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which escalated the conflict between Israel and Iran. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction However, markets quickly responded to positive developments. Ethereum rebounded strongly above the $2,400 level following reports that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, temporarily easing global risk sentiment. This relief rally brought new optimism to the Ethereum market, especially amid signs of institutional confidence. According to data shared by top analyst Ted Pillows, a major whale or institutional entity purchased another $8.91 million worth of ETH, continuing an aggressive accumulation streak. Over the past three weeks, this same entity has reportedly bought $422 million in Ethereum, signaling strong conviction despite recent market stress. This wave of accumulation suggests that long-term players may view the current price zone as a key opportunity, reinforcing the idea that Ethereum could be building a base for its next major move once broader conditions stabilize. Ethereum Surges As Ceasefire Ignites Market Optimism Ethereum surged over 14% following reports of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, providing a much-needed relief rally after weeks of geopolitical tension and uncertainty. The news sparked a wave of bullish momentum across the market, with ETH rebounding sharply from recent lows near $2,100 to trade firmly above the $2,400 mark. Bulls, who had lost control amid panic selling, are now showing signs of strength as the market prepares for its next decisive move. Despite this rebound, caution remains. The broader macroeconomic environment continues to tighten, with rising concerns over a potential US recession, high Treasury yields, and sustained hawkishness from the Federal Reserve. These factors could weigh on risk assets in the weeks ahead, putting Ethereum’s rally to the test. Nonetheless, optimism is building, especially around the possibility of the long-awaited altseason—one that many believe will be led by Ethereum. Adding fuel to this narrative is the growing trend of whale accumulation. According to insights shared by analyst Ted Pillows, a major whale or institutional entity has just acquired another $8.91 million worth of ETH. This purchase adds to a staggering $422 million in Ethereum accumulated over the past three weeks. Such aggressive buying suggests that large players are positioning themselves for a major move ahead, likely expecting Ethereum to be at the forefront of the next market cycle. As ETH consolidates above key levels, the accumulation trend could act as a foundational force supporting higher prices, especially if macro and geopolitical risks stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move ETH Reclaims $2,400 Following Sharp Rebound Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,400 level after a swift rebound from a breakdown near $2,100. The recent candle structure on the 3-day chart shows a strong wick to the downside, followed by a recovery, reflecting the impact of geopolitical developments, most notably the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. This bounce prevented a deeper selloff and has brought Ethereum back above a key psychological level. Looking at the chart, ETH remains under pressure from the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, currently acting as resistance around the $2,638 and $2,779 zones. Price also recently broke a short-term descending trendline and is now attempting to consolidate above it. This suggests the potential for a trend reversal if bulls can sustain momentum and push through the moving average cluster.

2025-06-24T15:00:11,"Bitcoin Triumph: The Blockchain Group Unveils Massive 1,728 BTC Holdings and Soaring Yield","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Triumph: The Blockchain Group Unveils Massive 1,728 BTC Holdings and Soaring Yield The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news from The Blockchain Group , which recently announced a significant expansion of its Bitcoin reserves. This move isn’t just a simple purchase; it’s a bold statement in the evolving landscape of corporate Bitcoin strategy , pushing their total BTC holdings to an impressive 1,728 and showcasing an extraordinary 1,231.7% year-to-date yield. For anyone interested in crypto investment , this development offers a fascinating glimpse into how major players are leveraging digital assets to achieve remarkable financial success. What’s Behind The Blockchain Group’s Latest Bitcoin Acquisition? The Blockchain Group ‘s recent acquisition of 75 BTC for approximately €6.9 million, announced via X, underscores their unwavering confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t their first foray into significant Bitcoin purchases, but each new addition reinforces their long-term vision for digital assets and their commitment to a robust corporate Bitcoin strategy . Why are forward-thinking companies like The Blockchain Group increasingly accumulating Bitcoin ? The reasons are compelling and multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: Many institutional investors and corporations view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce, decentralized asset that can potentially preserve value against fiat currency devaluation and economic uncertainties. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to traditional investment portfolios can help reduce overall risk and enhance returns, offering a unique avenue for growth. Growth Potential: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin’s historical performance has demonstrated immense upside potential, attracting entities seeking significant long-term appreciation. Strategic Positioning: Being an early or prominent mover in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies can provide a significant competitive edge, positioning a company at the forefront of financial innovation. Understanding The Blockchain Group’s Impressive 1,728 BTC Holdings With this latest purchase, The Blockchain Group ‘s total BTC holdings now stand at 1,728. While this figure may not match the colossal reserves of crypto giants like MicroStrategy (which holds over 200,000 BTC), it firmly positions The Blockchain Group as a notable institutional holder. This substantial reserve reflects a deliberate and sustained corporate Bitcoin strategy , emphasizing a long-term belief in the asset’s value. Perhaps even more striking is the reported year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 1,231.7%. This astounding figure highlights the substantial gains possible for strategic and early adopters in the crypto space. While the exact mechanisms generating this yield are not detailed in the announcement, it typically involves a combination of market appreciation of their existing holdings and potentially other yield-generating activities such as staking or lending their Bitcoin reserves. This demonstrates not just holding, but actively growing their digital asset portfolio. Key figures from The Blockchain Group ‘s announcement: Current Total BTC Holdings: 1,728 BTC Latest Bitcoin Acquisition: 75 BTC Approximate Cost of Latest Purchase: €6.9 million Year-to-Date Bitcoin Yield: 1,231.7% The Power of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: A Growing Trend The Blockchain Group ‘s actions are part of a broader, accelerating trend: corporations integrating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves. This shift signifies a growing recognition among businesses that Bitcoin is not merely a speculative asset, but a legitimate and potentially valuable component of a robust treasury management system. This evolution signals a maturing market and burgeoning institutional confidence in digital assets. Notable examples of companies that have embraced a significant corporate Bitcoin strategy include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding an immense amount as its primary treasury reserve asset, effectively transforming into a Bitcoin holding company. Tesla: While its holdings have fluctuated, Tesla’s initial large purchase brought significant mainstream attention and legitimacy to corporate crypto adoption. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s financial services company has also invested in Bitcoin, aligning with its mission to empower economic independence through decentralized finance. This growing trend suggests a future where digital assets play a more central role in corporate finance, moving beyond niche speculation to mainstream treasury management and strategic asset allocation. Navigating Crypto Investment: Benefits and Risks For individuals and institutions alike, crypto investment offers compelling opportunities, as powerfully demonstrated by The Blockchain Group ‘s impressive yield. However, it’s crucial to approach this space with a clear understanding of both the potential benefits and the inherent risks. Key Benefits of Crypto Investment: High Growth Potential: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have historically delivered substantial returns, outperforming many traditional asset classes over various timeframes. Decentralization: The peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin offers freedom from traditional financial intermediaries and government control, appealing to those seeking financial autonomy. Accessibility: Crypto markets operate 24/7, globally, with relatively lower barriers to entry compared to some traditional investments, making them accessible to a wider audience. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Price swings in the crypto market can be extreme and rapid, leading to substantial gains or equally significant losses in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential challenges and unpredictable shifts for investors and businesses. Security Concerns: The digital nature of crypto assets makes them susceptible to hacks, scams, and the irreversible loss of private keys if not managed with utmost care. Market Manipulation: Smaller market capitalization assets can be more susceptible to manipulation by large holders or coordinated groups, leading to artificial price movements. Actionable Insight: Always conduct thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) and carefully consider your risk tolerance before engaging in crypto investment . Diversification, both within crypto and across different asset classes, remains a key strategy for managing risk. What Does This Mean for The Blockchain Group’s Future? The Blockchain Group ‘s continued and substantial accumulation of Bitcoin signals a strong conviction in the long-term value proposition of digital assets. This aggressive and forward-thinking stance, combined with their reported high yield, could serve as a blueprint for other companies looking to enhance their treasury strategies with cryptocurrencies. Their actions validate Bitcoin as a serious asset class for corporate balance sheets. This strategic approach could lead to several positive outcomes for the company: Increased Shareholder Value: Direct appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings can significantly boost the company’s overall valuation and financial health. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Being recognized as a technologically astute and innovative company that embraces future-oriented financial strategies can attract new talent and business opportunities. Potential for Future Expansion: Leveraging their significant BTC holdings , The Blockchain Group might explore further ventures within the blockchain ecosystem, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3 initiatives. As the digital economy continues its rapid expansion, companies that strategically embrace assets like Bitcoin are likely to be at the forefront of innovation, demonstrating robust financial foresight and securing a strong position in the evolving global market. The Blockchain Group ‘s latest 75 BTC purchase, bringing their total BTC holdings to 1,728, is a powerful testament to the growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin . Coupled with an astounding 1,231.7% year-to-date yield, their corporate Bitcoin strategy exemplifies the significant opportunities available in crypto investment . While the journey involves inherent volatility, the benefits of diversification, inflation hedging, and growth potential are clearly driving more companies to consider Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. This decisive move by The Blockchain Group not only strengthens their financial position but also highlights the increasing legitimacy and transformative potential of the digital asset space for businesses worldwide.

The move could legalize Bitcoin ETFs and reduce the tax on crypto gains from up to 55% to a flat 20%. This marks a strategic change toward embracing Web3 technologies as part of Japan’s economic agenda. Japan has signaled a shift in its approach to cryptocurrency, with regulators putting a sweeping proposal on the table that would dramatically cut taxes on crypto gains and clear the path for the nation to launch its own Bitcoin ETFs. The plan was unveiled today by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to bring crypto assets under the country’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). If the proposal is approved, crypto assets in Japan, currently regulated under the Payment Services Act, would be officially recognized as “financial products” under the FIEA. The move aims to align cryptocurrencies more closely with traditional investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds. The proposal will be discussed at the upcoming Financial Services Council meeting on June 25.

2025-06-24T14:52:34,"Pulte’s FHFA eyes crypto in $8.5 trillion U.S. housing and mortgage markets — what’s next?","What does Pulte’s FHFA crypto mortgage signal actually mean for American homebuyers, and could it rewrite lending norms for those who store wealth in Bitcoin and stablecoins? Table of Contents Mortgage, Pulte, and FHFA enter the crypto conversation Freddie Mac compliance drives lender finance models How crypto might be evaluated Gains in private finance suggest real demand for Bitcoin integration Mortgage, Pulte, and FHFA enter the crypto conversation In a recent announcement, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has publicly stated that the agency will “study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages.” The announcement, posted on X on Jun. 24, introduces the possibility that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets could soon factor into U.S. home loan evaluations. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 The idea comes at a time when housing access remains strained. As of mid-2025, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is just under 7%, the highest level since the mid-2000s. 30-year fixed mortgage rate chart | Source: FRED In May, the median price for an existing home reached $422,800, a record high for the month. Existing home sales have also slowed sharply, with May 2025 marking the weakest pace for that month since 2009. Meanwhile, the affordability squeeze is especially pronounced for first-time buyers. According to the National Association of Realtors, only 30% of home purchases are currently being made by first-time buyers, well below the 40% share considered typical for a balanced market. Rising monthly payments and strict lending criteria have made access difficult for younger buyers and self-employed individuals, particularly those with irregular income but sizable assets. The FHFA is now examining whether crypto holdings could be considered similar to savings, investment portfolios, or other assets during mortgage evaluations. Under such a framework, for example, a person holding $200,000 worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum ( ETH ), but lacking a traditional salary, might still qualify for a loan based on their overall net worth. At present, most mortgage lenders exclude crypto from financial assessments, citing concerns over price volatility, limited regulatory clarity, and the challenges of verifying digital asset ownership. Even high net-worth applicants holding substantial crypto assets are often treated as lacking adequate financial stability under current standards. The FHFA’s announcement does not indicate a finalized policy or regulatory timeline. The review remains in its early stages, and many operational and legal questions will need to be addressed before any change is implemented. Freddie Mac compliance drives lender finance models The FHFA plays a quiet but central role in shaping how Americans access home loans. It oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored entities that guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the United States. It also regulates the Federal Home Loan Bank system, a network of regional banks that provide liquidity to housing and community development lenders. According to the agency’s data, these institutions collectively support over $8.5 trillion in U.S. home financing. Any change in policy issued by the FHFA carries broad market consequences. Updates to guidelines on credit scores, down payments, or eligible asset classes often influence how banks and lenders structure their loan products. Most lending institutions follow FHFA standards to ensure that their mortgages remain eligible for resale to Fannie or Freddie, which helps manage long-term risk exposure. The agency was established in 2008, following the housing market collapse, with a mandate to strengthen oversight and preserve the safety and liquidity of the mortgage finance system. Within that framework, even a preliminary inquiry into counting crypto assets toward mortgage qualifications carries real weight. The agency’s current direction is closely tied to the background of its director, Bill Pulte. Appointed in March 2025 during President Trump ’s second term, Pulte took office after a lengthy confirmation process. He is the grandson of William Pulte, founder of Pulte Homes, one of the largest homebuilders in the country. Before entering public service, Pulte led Pulte Capital, a private investment firm. He also gained a public following through philanthropic giveaways on X, where he became known as the “Twitter Philanthropist.” Unlike his predecessors, Pulte has direct involvement in the crypto space. Financial disclosures show personal holdings of $500,000 to $1 million in Bitcoin, along with a similar-sized position in Solana ( SOL ). He also holds equity in Marathon Digital Holdings, a U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company, and has previously invested in speculative stocks such as GameStop. His profile stands out in a field typically characterized by conservative financial backgrounds. Pulte has publicly supported crypto since 2019, using his social media presence to promote adoption and encourage policy openness toward digital assets. While the FHFA’s review of crypto in mortgage underwriting is still early and exploratory, its very consideration reflects a shift in both the asset class’s relevance and the leadership’s priorities. How crypto might be evaluated Pulte’s announcement has raised fresh questions about how crypto holdings might eventually be evaluated under mortgage lending standards. Currently, borrowers who want to use digital assets in the mortgage process must first convert them into U.S. dollars and deposit the funds into a regulated American bank account. To meet eligibility for down payments or reserves under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, those funds must also be seasoned, meaning they must remain in the account for at least 60 days. The FHFA’s review is expected to examine whether these requirements can or should be updated. One likely area of focus is asset valuation. Due to the volatility of crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, lenders may hesitate to accept their full market value when assessing borrower assets. A common method in traditional finance is to apply a haircut — a discount from the stated value — to account for potential price swings. Whether similar adjustments would be adopted for crypto remains uncertain. Holding history may also come under review. Lenders often view long-held assets more favorably than short-term holdings. Assets with clear documentation, consistent custody, and minimal trading activity may carry more weight than those recently acquired or frequently moved. Stablecoins present a separate set of considerations. Tokens such as USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ) are designed to maintain a consistent value relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make them more suitable for underwriting purposes. Even so, treatment of stablecoins would depend on regulatory comfort with their structure, custody arrangements, and transparency standards. For now, mortgage advisors commonly recommend that crypto holders convert their assets to dollars well in advance of applying for a loan, giving lenders time to verify the source of funds and ensuring the assets meet seasoning requirements. Any future update is likely to preserve strict documentation standards. Borrowers would still need to show a complete audit trail, including wallet ownership, transaction history, and evidence that the funds are not tied to loans or suspicious activity. Verification of custody, clarity of origin, and compliance with anti-money laundering rules are also expected to remain central to any policy changes under consideration. Gains in private finance suggest real demand for Bitcoin integration While federal regulators are just beginning to explore the idea of integrating crypto into mortgage lending, several private fintech firms have already launched experimental models. Milo Credit, a Florida-based lender, introduced one of the first crypto mortgage products in the U.S. in 2022. Its structure departs from the traditional approach. Rather than requiring borrowers to sell crypto and make a cash down payment, Milo allows buyers to pledge digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or certain stablecoins, as collateral. The setup enables clients to finance up to 100% of the home’s value without liquidating their crypto holdings. Similarly, Figure Technologies, a San Francisco fintech company led by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, has explored large-scale crypto-backed mortgage programs, offering loans as high as $20 million using digital assets as security. According to Milo, clients continue to retain ownership of their pledged crypto, which means they can benefit if asset values rise during the mortgage term. Another advantage is tax-related: selling large crypto positions to cover a down payment would typically trigger capital gains taxes. By pledging rather than selling, borrowers avoid those immediate tax events. As of early-2025, Milo reported over $65 million in crypto-collateralized home loans issued. However, these private offerings function outside the federal mortgage system. Their loans are not eligible for resale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, meaning they cannot benefit from the same level of liquidity and risk-sharing that conventional loans do. As a result, interest rates tend to be higher, and lenders often retain the loans in-house or work with alternative investors to fund them. These limitations place a ceiling on how widely such products can scale. Another constraint is risk. Crypto-backed mortgages usually require over-collateralization — meaning borrowers must pledge more in crypto value than the loan amount to offset volatility. But even with that buffer, price swings can present challenges. A drop of 15% in asset value between approval and closing is enough to disrupt a loan. And historically, crypto drawdowns have been far steeper. If the FHFA chooses to move forward, it could bring more consistency and structure to the space. Private models have shown that crypto can be integrated into housing finance, but only with careful safeguards and a full understanding of its tradeoffs. Whether the outcome is adoption, rejection, or something in between, the process will influence how crypto is viewed not just in capital markets, but in everyday financial life.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/pulte-fhfa-crypto-housing-mortgage-move/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Donald Trump|Regulation|United States",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T14:51:30,"Ripple’s XRP Rockets 11%: Is $3 Next After SEC Twist?","The latest price action saw XRP leap from $1.97 to a high of $2.173, posting a 10.5% range and confirming a decisive breakout above the $2 psychological barrier. Volume spiked to 217 million during the late session, nearly three times the average, as buyers overwhelmed sellers and established $2.06 as a new support zone. Technical analysts highlight that XRP has now cleared both the 100-hour moving average and a multi-month bearish trend line, setting up a bullish structure if the $2.13–$2.15 region holds. Whale Transfers and On-Chain Signals On-chain data reveals a flurry of large XRP transfers in recent days. Notably, a whale moved $58 million in XRP to Coinbase, raising fears of a potential selloff. Yet, instead of tanking, XRP’s price held firm—showing “impressive resilience” even as other cryptos struggled amid global tensions. “XRP’s breakout is real—volume, whales, and retail are all in sync. $3 is next if this momentum holds.” — @CryptoDom Analysts suggest this signals a maturing market, with institutional buyers absorbing supply and retail traders undeterred by whale moves. Ripple itself transferred nearly $439 million in XRP to an unknown wallet, sparking debate about the company’s intentions. While some community members worry about transparency, others see these moves as positioning for a potential spot ETF or treasury accumulation, especially as the SEC lawsuit nears a resolution. Ripple v. SEC: Lawsuit Timelines Fuel Sentiment The ongoing Ripple v. SEC case remains a major driver of sentiment. After a recent 60-day pause in appeals, investors are watching for the next round of filings, which could bring long-awaited regulatory clarity. The settlement of this years-long battle has already shifted industry sentiment, with many now betting on an eventual XRP ETF approval and broader institutional adoption. Google Trends and Retail FOMO: “XRP to $3” Goes Viral Retail interest is exploding. Google autocomplete queries for “XRP to $3,” “XRP price prediction,” and “Is XRP a good investment?” have surged in the past week. On January 15, XRP even surpassed Bitcoin in global search volume, a rare feat that underscores the token’s growing mainstream appeal. The “XRP Army” community continues to swell, with 58,000 new holders joining in 2025 and daily active addresses up 490% since 2022. Bulls and Bears Draw Battle Lines Market analysts remain split. Some see a clear path to $3 and beyond, citing strong technicals, whale accumulation, and the prospect of an ETF. Others warn of a possible 25% correction if support at $2.13 fails, especially if whale selling accelerates. For now, the structure remains bullish as long as XRP holds above $2.13–$2.15. The implications go beyond short-term price action. Sustained institutional interest and elevated network activity could set new market dynamics for XRP, potentially supporting its long-term value and reinforcing its position as a leading cross-border payments token. For now, all eyes are on whether this wave of participation can help XRP break through the $2.20–$2.30 resistance and sustain its bullish momentum Bottom Line XRP’s 11% rally to $2.20 is powered by a rare alignment of technical strength, whale accumulation, and surging retail interest. With Ripple’s legal saga nearing its climax and search trends pointing to $3, all eyes are on whether XRP can sustain its momentum—or if another round of volatility is just around the corner.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9688/ripple-s-xrp-rockets-11-is-3-next-after-sec-twist,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Ripple",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T14:46:30,"Capitulation Signs? Ethereum Whale Offloads 5,000 ETH in Panic Move","A flood of sell orders hit Ethereum after a major whale transferred 5,000 ETH—worth about $12 million—to Binance, triggering alarm among analysts who view it as a possible capitulation signal. Blockchain tracker Lookonchain shared the on-chain data on X, noting this whale’s sudden transfer that coincided with a sharp dip in ETH’s price earlier in the day. Such large, abrupt wallet movements often precede heavy sell-offs. ETH source: lookonchain ETH Whale Movement Sparks Concerns The key transaction unfolded shortly before ETH price dropped to as low as $2,240, per CoinGecko data. The seller reportedly retains around $12 million in ETH at press time. While whale offloading is not uncommon, timing and scale often make them noteworthy. According to CoinGlass data, the sell-off catalyzed around $300 million in liquidations across Ethereum derivatives in the past 24 hours. That surge aligns with an 8% fall in ETH’s price this week, marking it among the worst performers by market capitalization. Crypto markets absorbed $712 million in liquidations during the same period. During the rug pull, Bitcoin dominance rose sharply. As Ethereum sold off, BTC held steady, underscoring its status as a relative safe haven amid market distress. ETH/BTC ratio remains above 0.017, but the shift highlights capital rotation toward Bitcoin. This bearish whale action comes alongside record highs in Ethereum derivatives. Glassnode reports ETH futures open interest now tops $20 billion, marking an all-time high leveraged by traders using stablecoin-based contracts. Analysts note that such leverage increases vulnerability—sharp price moves can trigger cascading liquidations. Crypto trader “Credible Crypto” flagged $2,240 as a critical support level; breaking below could prompt a slide toward $2,000–2,100. Ethereum’s next support lies near the low-$2,200s range. A bounce may require robust uptake in spot ETF inflows or institutional accumulation, neither of which has outweighed this wave of liquidations yet. It’s not the first time whale behavior has triggered concern. Lookonchain identified on X a 48,825 ETH purchase (~$127 million), suggesting a contrast between profit-taking and accumulation points in time. The latest transfer, however, aligns more with panic-driven selling. Source: X On-chain sadness and fear may be setting in. But several established whales continue building positions—as many analysts suggested accumulation during pullbacks reflects longer-term confidence. Still, this 5,000 ETH transfer and active liquidations emphasize how leverage can amplify a sell move. What This Means for Traders With futures leverage at record highs and whales fleeing, ETH faces short-term downside risk. But whales also load up during price dips—creating volatility both ways. Traders need to monitor exchange inflows and outflows, futures liquidations, and BTC ratio for clues.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/capitulation-signs-ethereum-whale-offloads-5000-eth-in-panic-move/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

In a recent post on X, Sugar declared that this is the moment XRP holders have been waiting for, calling it a “now or never” scenario for the digital asset. A Bold Prediction Backed by Market Momentum Sugar’s prediction hinges on one critical factor: a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs . According to him, if Bitcoin can break past its current resistance and set new highs, it would likely trigger a wave of capital rotation into altcoins, a common pattern seen during bullish market cycles. In this scenario, XRP could benefit immensely and finally catch up to the broader market’s momentum. This kind of explosive rally would represent a 500%+ increase from XRP’s current trading range near $2. The validator believes this run-up would not only signal a major altcoin season but also position XRP among the top performers, finally delivering the price action many long-term holders have anticipated for years. Ok, you all have asked so here it is. The top for $XRP will be $11.33-$13.83. I would like to see this achieved in the next 30-40 days but it can extend in to the end of August.

With global market sentiment improving and crypto-friendly momentum growing, especially amid regulatory developments, this may be XRP’s best shot at achieving its long-promised breakout. “This is the moment,” Sugar wrote. “If $BTC breaks out to new highs, then the altcoin market should follow.” He added that although he expects to see this move within a month or so, he would allow for an extension into late August if market conditions take longer to align. Notably, he has promised to share detailed charts and technical reasoning behind his prediction soon, further building anticipation among traders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Legal Case and Market Sentiment This forecast also arrives at a critical moment in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As both parties work toward finalizing a penalty settlement , the outcome could have significant implications for XRP’s market trajectory. A favorable resolution may remove one of the biggest overhangs affecting XRP’s price for years. Institutional interest is also picking up, following recent moves by U.S. regulators that have made crypto access slightly more favorable for banks. Combined with Ripple’s continued push for enterprise adoption, including its rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin, market conditions appear more supportive than ever. All Eyes on Bitcoin, and Sugar’s Charts While Sugar has not yet shared the technical analysis supporting his $11–$13 XRP projection, his reputation as a trusted validator and market commentator has given his words significant weight. The community now waits to see the charts he plans to publish, which could offer more clarity into the pattern or fractal analysis he’s using to justify such a target. Until then, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s next move. Should BTC break to new highs, XRP may indeed ride the wave — possibly straight into double digits.

2025-06-24T14:40:11,"Trump Iran News: De-escalation Triumph? Assessing the Aftermath of Missile Retaliation","BitcoinWorld Trump Iran News: De-escalation Triumph? Assessing the Aftermath of Missile Retaliation The world often holds its breath when geopolitical tensions escalate, and the financial markets, including the ever-dynamic cryptocurrency space, feel every ripple. When news emerged of Iran’s missile retaliation following the U.S. strike on Qasem Soleimani, global investors braced for impact. However, U.S. President Donald Trump’s immediate response offered a surprising turn, shaping not just immediate reactions but also the long-term outlook for global stability and various asset classes. This incident, as reported by JinSe Finance, provides a fascinating case study in how political rhetoric can swiftly alter market sentiment and the perception of risk. Trump Iran News: Did Advance Warning Avert a Crisis? In the wake of Iran’s missile strikes, President Donald Trump addressed the nation, delivering a message that swiftly eased widespread fears of a full-blown war. He characterized Iran’s retaliation as “weak” and “ineffective,” highlighting that out of 14 missiles launched, 13 were intercepted, resulting in no U.S. casualties and only minor damage to an airbase. But perhaps the most striking detail, and one that quickly became a focal point of analysis, was Trump’s direct acknowledgement: he “thanked Iran for advance notice.” This seemingly casual remark carried immense weight. It suggested a pre-arranged understanding, a carefully orchestrated move by Iran to save face domestically while avoiding a direct, escalatory confrontation with the United States. This “advance notice” allowed U.S. forces to take precautionary measures, ensuring the safety of personnel and minimizing potential damage. In essence, it transformed a moment of potential crisis into a controlled, symbolic act of retaliation, preventing a wider, more destructive conflict. This immediate de-escalation was a critical turning point, profoundly impacting global markets and setting a precedent for managing future international disputes. What Was the True Geopolitical Impact Beyond Initial Fears? The initial hours following the missile strikes were fraught with uncertainty. Global markets reacted instinctively: oil prices surged, stock futures plummeted, and traditional safe-haven assets like gold saw significant gains. There was a palpable sense that the Middle East was on the brink of a major conflict. However, once President Trump’s measured response became clear, and the reality of the limited damage and lack of casualties sank in, the immediate panic subsided almost as quickly as it began. The true geopolitical impact of this event, therefore, was less about direct military escalation and more about the demonstration of a delicate, albeit dangerous, dance between two powerful adversaries. It showcased that even amidst intense animosity, channels for de-escalation and communication can exist, whether overt or covert. While the underlying tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and indeed across the broader Middle East, remained unresolved, this specific incident proved that both sides, at that moment, preferred to avoid an all-out war. This provided a temporary reprieve for global stability, allowing markets to rebound and focus on other economic fundamentals, rather than immediate conflict. Key Takeaways from the Incident: Avoided Direct Escalation: The most significant outcome was the prevention of a larger military conflict. Informal Communication Channels: The “advance notice” highlighted the existence of back-channel communications. Brief Market Jitters: Financial markets reacted sharply but recovered quickly, demonstrating resilience. Underlying Tensions Remain: Despite de-escalation, the fundamental geopolitical friction in the region persists. Can Middle East Stability Be Achieved Amidst Ongoing Tensions? President Trump’s statement went beyond merely acknowledging the missile strike; he also expressed hope for regional peace and stated his intention to encourage Israel to pursue the same. This highlights the intricate web of relationships and conflicts that define Middle East stability . The region is a geopolitical chessboard, with numerous state and non-state actors vying for influence, often through proxy conflicts and ideological battles. From the ongoing civil war in Syria to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, true stability remains an elusive goal. The incident with Iran, while contained, serves as a stark reminder of how quickly regional flashpoints can escalate and impact global affairs, including energy markets and international trade routes. For investors, understanding the dynamics of Middle East stability is crucial, as sustained peace can foster investor confidence, encouraging investment in risk-on assets, while instability can trigger flights to safety. Trump’s call for broader regional peace, while ambitious, underscores the global desire to mitigate risks emanating from this volatile but strategically vital part of the world. How Do Geopolitical Shocks Drive Market Volatility? Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major global powers or critical regions, are potent drivers of market volatility . The immediate aftermath of the Iran missile strikes perfectly illustrated this phenomenon. As news broke, investors reacted by shedding riskier assets and flocking to perceived safe havens. This rapid reallocation of capital leads to sharp price swings across various asset classes. The interconnectedness of global financial systems means that a crisis in one region can send shockwaves worldwide. For the cryptocurrency market, while often touted as uncorrelated with traditional finance, significant geopolitical events can still have a profound impact. Bitcoin, for instance, frequently experiences price movements in response to global uncertainty. During the initial fear surrounding the Iran incident, Bitcoin saw a brief surge, mirroring gold’s performance, as some investors sought alternatives to traditional fiat currencies and stock markets. However, its high volatility also means that these gains can be short-lived once the immediate crisis subsides or de-escalation occurs. Understanding this interplay is vital for crypto investors looking to navigate turbulent times. Market Reactions During the Iran-U.S. Tensions: Event Traditional Market Reaction (Initial) Cryptocurrency Market Reaction (Bitcoin) U.S. Strike on Soleimani Stocks down, Oil prices up, Gold up Bitcoin price surged Iran Missile Retaliation Stocks down, Oil prices up, Gold up (briefly) Bitcoin price surged (briefly) Trump’s De-escalation Speech Stocks recovered, Oil prices down, Gold down Bitcoin price retreated from peak Are Safe-Haven Assets Like Bitcoin a True Sanctuary in Crisis? The concept of safe-haven assets becomes particularly relevant during periods of geopolitical uncertainty. Traditionally, assets like gold, the U.S. dollar, and certain government bonds are considered safe havens, as they are expected to retain or increase in value during market downturns. In recent years, Bitcoin has increasingly been discussed in this context, with proponents arguing it acts as a “digital gold” due to its decentralized nature and limited supply. During the Iran crisis, Bitcoin’s initial price surge reinforced this narrative for many. However, its relatively young history and inherent volatility mean that its status as a true safe haven is still debated. While it can offer a hedge against traditional financial systems, it is also susceptible to its own market dynamics and speculative trading. For investors, the actionable insight is clear: while cryptocurrencies might offer diversification and a potential hedge against certain risks, relying solely on them as a safe haven without understanding their unique risk profile can be precarious. A balanced portfolio, considering both traditional and digital assets, remains the most prudent approach during times of global uncertainty. A Compelling Conclusion: Navigating an Interconnected World The Iran missile incident, and President Trump’s subsequent response, served as a powerful reminder of the intricate dance between geopolitics, diplomacy, and global financial markets. What began as a moment of intense fear quickly transitioned into a cautious de-escalation, largely due to perceived advance warnings and measured reactions from both sides. While the immediate threat of a wider conflict receded, the underlying complexities and tensions in the Middle East persist, continually influencing global economic sentiment. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, such events underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world. Geopolitical shifts, market volatility, and the evolving role of assets like Bitcoin as potential safe havens are all part of a larger narrative. Staying informed, understanding the nuanced reactions of various asset classes, and maintaining a diversified and adaptable investment strategy are paramount in navigating an increasingly unpredictable global landscape. The quest for Middle East stability continues, and with it, the ripple effects across all facets of the global economy.

2025-06-24T14:40:00,"Andy Konwinski’s Visionary $100M Pledge Fuels Independent AI Research Through Laude Institute","BitcoinWorld Andy Konwinski’s Visionary $100M Pledge Fuels Independent AI Research Through Laude Institute In a truly transformative move poised to reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence, Andy Konwinski , a visionary co-founder behind tech giants Databricks and Perplexity AI , has announced a monumental $100 million pledge for his new venture, Laude Institute . This bold initiative aims to inject fresh capital and independent thought into the burgeoning field of AI research , promising a new era for innovation that prioritizes beneficial outcomes over purely commercial gains. For those invested in the future of technology and its ethical development, Konwinski’s commitment marks a pivotal moment. Andy Konwinski’s Vision: Catalyzing Independent AI Research Andy Konwinski , a computer scientist with a formidable track record, has always been at the forefront of technological advancement. His co-founding roles at Databricks , a leader in big data analytics and AI, and Perplexity AI , a revolutionary conversational answer engine, speak volumes about his foresight. On Monday, Konwinski unveiled his personal company, Laude, is forming a new AI research institute, backed by a significant $100 million of his own money. This isn’t just another lab; the Laude Institute is structured more like a fund, making investments akin to grants, designed to empower researchers without the immediate pressures of commercialization. The institute’s board boasts an impressive lineup of academic and industry luminaries: Dave Patterson: A UC Berkeley professor renowned for his award-winning research in computer architecture. Jeff Dean: Known globally as Google’s chief scientist, a titan in AI development. Joelle Pineau: Meta’s vice president of AI Research, bringing deep expertise from a major tech player. The Laude Institute has already made its first significant commitment: a flagship grant of $3 million per year for five years. This substantial funding will anchor the new AI Systems Lab at UC Berkeley, a lab set to open in 2027 and led by the celebrated Ion Stoica. Stoica, also a co-founder of Anyscale and Databricks, both born from Berkeley’s lab system, brings invaluable experience to this new endeavor. This foundational grant underscores Laude’s commitment to fostering deep, impactful AI research at leading academic institutions. The Laude Institute: A New Paradigm for AI Advancement Konwinski articulated the Laude Institute’s core mission in his blog post, describing it as “built by and for computer science researchers … We exist to catalyze work that doesn’t just push the field forward but guides it towards more beneficial outcomes.” This statement is a subtle yet pointed commentary on the current landscape of AI development, where many organizations, including those that started with noble research goals like OpenAI, have arguably become consumed by their commercial ambitions. The institute’s structure is unique, operating across boundaries as a nonprofit with a public benefit corporation arm. Konwinski is strategically dividing his research investments into two distinct categories: Slingshots: These are geared towards early-stage research projects that can benefit from grants and hands-on support, providing the initial push for promising ideas. Moonshots: As the name suggests, these are long-horizon labs tackling “species-level challenges” such as AI for scientific discovery, civic discourse, healthcare, and workforce reskilling. This bucket aims for truly groundbreaking, long-term impact. For instance, Laude has already collaborated with “terminal-bench,” a Stanford-led benchmark designed to assess how well AI agents handle tasks, a tool actively utilized by companies like Anthropic. This demonstrates a practical approach to fostering foundational tools that benefit the wider AI research community. Beyond Profit: The Imperative for Ethical AI Research The increasing commercialization of AI has led to a muddled research environment. We’ve seen a proliferation of AI benchmarks designed to prove that a particular vendor’s model works best, rather than objectively measuring progress. Even major players like Salesforce have developed their own LLM benchmarks for CRMs, highlighting a trend where research often serves commercial interests. A recent controversy involving popular AI researcher Epoch, which revealed OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks used to unveil its new o3 model, further illustrates this blurred line. The founder of Epoch also launched a startup with the controversial mission to replace all human workers everywhere with AI agents. These examples underscore the urgent need for truly independent AI research that is not swayed by commercial pressures or profit motives. This is where an alliance like the one Konwinski is forging, with the likes of Jeff Dean and Ion Stoica, becomes critically important. Their support for independent research could lead to innovations that are genuinely “human-helpful” and foster a more ethical, beneficial path for AI development. This initiative presents an attractive alternative to the often-conflicted models currently dominating the space. The Financial Backbone: Success of Databricks and Perplexity AI Many might wonder how Andy Konwinski amassed the fortune necessary to pledge a staggering $100 million to this new endeavor. The answer lies in the phenomenal success of his previous ventures, particularly Databricks and Perplexity AI . In January, Databricks closed a funding round that valued the company at an astounding $62 billion, a testament to its pivotal role in the big data and AI landscape. Similarly, Perplexity AI secured a $14 billion valuation just last month, solidifying its position as a major player in conversational AI. It is important to note that Konwinski’s company, Laude, isn’t solely a grant-writing research institute. He also co-founded a for-profit venture fund, launched in 2024, with former NEA VC Pete Sonsini. This fund has quietly backed other startups and notably led a $12 million investment in AI agent infrastructure startup Arcade, as previously reported by Bitcoin World. A spokesperson for Laude confirmed that while Konwinski has pledged the initial $100 million, he is also actively seeking and open to additional investment from other successful technologists, signaling a broader vision for the fund’s impact. Why Laude Matters: Shaping the Future of AI In a world grappling with the rapid advancements of artificial intelligence, a pertinent question arises: does the world truly need yet another AI “good for humanity” research institute, especially one with a potentially murky nonprofit/commercial structure? The answer is both no, and emphatically yes. While the landscape of AI research has become increasingly muddled with commercial interests, the unique structure and clear mission of the Laude Institute offer a refreshing counter-narrative. By bringing together a formidable alliance of minds like Konwinski, Dean, and Stoica, Laude is poised to champion truly independent research. This independence is crucial for developing unbiased benchmarks, exploring ethical implications, and ensuring that AI innovations ultimately serve humanity rather than just corporate bottom lines. The potential for this initiative to foster genuinely independent, human-centric commerce and innovation is immense. Konwinski’s substantial pledge and the institute’s focus on “Slingshots” and “Moonshots” could ignite breakthroughs that address species-level challenges, steering the powerful currents of AI towards more beneficial outcomes for society as a whole. It’s an exciting prospect for anyone hoping for a more responsible and impactful future for AI.

Here Are the Details","Japan-based technology firm Metaplanet announced today that it will make a $5 billion capital contribution to its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, subject to board approval. The move is considered an important part of the company’s global expansion strategy. $5 Billion Capital Move from Metaplanet to the US: Global Growth Accelerates Metaplanet, which announced last month that it had established a U.S.-based subsidiary in Miami, Florida, is positioning the new structure as the centerpiece of its “aggressive global growth” plans. The company said the initial capitalization phase has been completed and it is now moving into the expansion phase. “As we continue to lead institutional Bitcoin adoption in Japan, our U.S. expansion demonstrates our commitment to establishing an integrated treasury model on a global scale,” Metaplanet said in a statement. The company said the new $5 billion contribution is planned to be financed through the use of share purchase rights. Bitcoin Stands Out With Its Strategy Metaplanet draws attention with the Bitcoin accumulation strategy it adopted in April 2024. Believing that this strategy will create shareholder value in the long term, the company purchased an additional 1,111 BTC earlier this week, increasing its treasury assets to a total of 11,111 BTC. With this figure, Metaplanet became the eighth largest institutional Bitcoin holder in the world, just 398 BTC behind Tesla (according to bitcointreasuries.net data). Metaplanet stated that the impact of the capital contribution on the current fiscal year will be limited, and emphasized that important developments will be shared with the public in a transparent manner. Despite the capital move and BTC purchase, markets have seen mixed reactions. Metaplanet’s shares traded on OTC Markets in the US (MTPLF) fell 5.9% to $11.64 on Monday, while its shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 6.36% as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Google Finance data. This move by Metaplanet sets an important example not only for cryptocurrency strategies but also for Japanese technology companies seeking global growth. *This is not investment advice.
