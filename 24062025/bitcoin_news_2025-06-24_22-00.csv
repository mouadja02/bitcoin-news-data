2025-06-24T19:57:20,"Fluence AI Roadmap: Delivering A Neutral Compute Layer for the Future of Intelligence With FLT","Fluence is building what centralized clouds cannot: an open, low cost and enterprise grade compute layer that is sovereign, transparent, and open to everyone. 2025 has started the way 2024 ended with cloud giants investing aggressively to dominate AI infrastructure. Microsoft is spending over $80 billion on new data centers, Google launched its AI Hypercomputer, Oracle is investing $25 billion into its Stargate AI clusters, and AWS is prioritizing AI-native services. Specialized players are scaling rapidly too. CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its March IPO and is worth over $70 billion currently. As AI becomes critical infrastructure, access to compute power will be one of the defining battles of our era. While hyperscalers consolidate and centralize compute power by building exclusive data centers and vertically integrating silicon, networks like Fluence offer a radically different vision— a decentralized, open, and neutral platform for AI compute, tokenizing compute to meet AI’s exponential demand and having FLT as a RWA Tokenized compute asset. Fluence is already collaborating with top decentralized infrastructure networks across AI (Spheron, Aethir, IO.net) and storage (Filecoin, Arweave, Akave, IPFS) on multiple initiatives, reinforcing its position as a neutral compute-data layer. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap for 2025–2026 focuses on the convergence of three key action areas: 1. Launching A Global GPU-Powered Compute Layer Fluence will soon support GPU nodes across the globe, enabling compute providers to contribute AI-ready hardware to the network. This new GPU mesh will upgrade Fluence platform from CPU-based capacity into an additional AI-grade compute layer, designed for inference, fine-tuning, and model serving. Fluence will integrate container support for secure, portable GPU job execution. Containerization enables reliable ML workload serving and establishes critical infrastructure for future inference, fine-tuning, and agentic applications across the decentralized network. Fluence will explore privacy-preserving inference through confidential computing for GPUs, keeping sensitive business or personal data private while helping reduce costs of AI inference. Using trusted execution environments (TEE) and encrypted memory, this R&D initiative enables sensitive workload processing while maintaining decentralization and supporting sovereign agent development. Key Milestones: GPU node onboarding – Q3 2025 GPU container runtime support live – Q4 2025 Confidential GPU computing R&D track kickoff – Q4 2025 Pilot confidential job execution – Q2 2026 2. Hosted AI Models And Unified Inference Fluence will provide one-click deployment templates for popular open-source models including LLMs, orchestration frameworks like LangChain, agentic stacks, and MCP servers. The Fluence platform AI stack will be expanded with an integrated inference layer for hosted models and agents. This simplifies AI model deployment while leveraging community contributions and external development support. Model + orchestration templates live – Q4 2025 Inference endpoints and routing infra live – Q2 2026 3. Enabling Verifiable, Community-Driven SLA Fluence will introduce a new approach to network trust and resilience through Guardians —retail and institutional actors who verify compute availability. Rather than relying on closed dashboards, Guardians monitor infrastructure through decentralized telemetry and earn FLT rewards for enforcing service-level agreements (SLAs). Guardians turn an enterprise-grade infrastructure network into something anyone can participate in —without needing to own hardware. The Guardian program is complemented by the Pointless Program, a gamified reputation system that rewards community contributions and leads to Guardian eligibility. Key Milestones: Guardian first batch – Q3 2025 Guardians full rollout and programmatic SLA – Q4 2025 4. Integrating AI Compute with a Composable Data Stack AI is not just compute—it’s compute + data . Fluence is building deep integrations with decentralized storage networks like Filecoin, Arweave, Akave, and IPFS to provide developers with access to verifiable datasets alongside execution environments. These integrations will allow users to define jobs that access persistent, distributed data and run on GPU-backed nodes— turning Fluence into a full-stack AI backend that is orchestrated via FLT. To support this, the network will offer composable templates and prebuilt SDK modules for connecting compute jobs with storage buckets or on-chain datasets. Developers building AI agents, LLM inference tools, or science applications will be able to treat Fluence like a modular AI pipeline—with open data, compute, and validation stitched together by protocol logic. Key Milestones: Decentralized storage backups – Q1 2026 Integrated dataset access for AI workloads – Q3 2026 From Cloudless Compute To Shared Intelligence With a roadmap focused on GPU onboarding, verifiable execution, and seamless data access, Fluence is laying the foundation for the next era of AI— one that will not be controlled by a handful of hyperscalers, but powered by a global community of cooperating and decentralized compute providers and participants The infrastructure for AI must reflect the values we want AI to serve: openness, collaboration, verifiability and accountability. Fluence is turning that principle into a protocol.

Bitcoin Has Reached Its Peak, Here’s the Latest on Altcoins","Cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment has revealed the cryptocurrencies that are currently in the money following the recent surge in the crypto market. According to the firm’s data, the majority of the supply of some leading cryptocurrencies is currently in the money. According to Santiment's data, the percentage of total supply that is in profit is as follows: Bitcoin (BTC): 94.5% Ethereum (ETH): 88.7% XRP: 65.1% Dogecoin (DOGE): 64.7% Chainlink (LINK): 59.4% Cardano (ADA): 46.5% Related News: This Altcoin's Price Experienced a Sudden Surge Today Following the Latest News - It Stood Out Positively in the Market Santiment notes that this metric shows how much of each asset’s circulating supply is currently in profit relative to the average on-chain purchase price. With 94.5% of Bitcoin’s supply in profit, it suggests that the majority of investors are currently in positive territory. According to Santiment, this indicates that market confidence is quite high, but it also points to a short-term risk of “overvaluation.” “When 19 out of every 20 BTC is in profit, the probability of investors realizing profits increases,” the company warned. On the other hand, the situation is reversed for coins like Cardano. Only 46.5% of ADA is in profit, meaning more than half of investors are currently at a loss. According to the analytics company, this shows that current prices are not satisfactory for the majority of investors, while at the same time it suggests that ADA may be relatively undervalued. *This is not investment advice.

According to a new press release , ProCap Financial, renamed ProCap BTC after it merged with Columbus Circle Capital I, has acquired $387 million in Bitcoin to actively manage a new digital asset treasury. The firm aims to raise as much as $1 billion to deploy the funds into various crypto-related revenue strategies that include lending, derivatives, and structured finance. According to the announcement, the Bitcoin purchase is part of an ongoing program that aims to provide investors with immediate exposure to the flagship crypto asset. In a new interview with CNBC, Pompliano, an outspoken BTC bull, lays out his vision for the firm. “We want to build the leading bitcoin-native financial services company – like a traditional Wall Street firm, but on top of a Bitcoin balance sheet instead of dollars… The goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution. That resonates very differently with capital allocators… Many companies don’t care about the cost of capital. We do. We’re traditional capital allocators — we care about building a sustainable business that generates cash flow.” BTC is worth $105,329 at time of writing, up 4% on the day.

2025-06-24T19:50:48,"Cardano-linked Midnight Network set to airdrop 24 billion NIGHT tokens to BTC, SOL and BTC holders","Midnight Network has announced that it will soon start airdropping its NIGHT token to XRP and Bitcoin holders. Apart from the two networks, Solana, Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Ethereum users will also get the token. The zero-knowledge proofs privacy blockchain with connections to Cardano disclosed this in a post , stating that the distribution process is designed to be fair and inclusive. Those who have held at least $100 worth of the native tokens across the listed blockchain network before Midnight’s snapshot can claim the tokens. Interestingly, Cardano has already taken some snapshots of random wallets across the eight different blockchain networks on the 11th of June, 2025, ensuring a wide distribution. This was confirmed in a short video on X by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who said, “The snapshot’s already been taken.” This marks the beginning of arguably one of the most significant multi-chain airdrops in crypto history, with over 37 million wallets expected to benefit from this largesse. The token prices will be based on the rates displayed on CoinMarketCap when the snapshots are taken. This is a security measure to prevent unwanted bot activities and Sybil attacks, ensuring a fair distribution and the safety of the process. According to the whitepaper, the NIGHT tokens will be shared gradually in 3 stages. The first stage, the Glacier drop, will see qualified users claim their full tokens within a 60-day window. Then, there will be a 30-day period when those people can claim the rest of the tokens by engaging in small computing tasks such as validating transactions or participating in the network’s consensus mechanism. Lastly, the Scavenger Mine is the final phase, where those who missed out on earlier claims but are eligible can get back a fraction of their original allocation. Participants can reclaim their tokens in this phase by performing specific tasks, similar to small computing tasks, within a given timeframe. Unclaimed tokens after this phase will go to the Midnight treasury. Cardano holders to get most of the airdrop supply According to information from the released whitepaper, there is a cumulative supply of 24 billion NIGHT tokens. Out of the 24 billion tokens, Cardano participants will receive 50% or 12 billion NIGHT. Bitcoin holders will also get 20% of the supply, totaling 4.8 billion tokens. Meanwhile, the rest of the supply will be distributed equally (according to CoinMarketCap Data) among holders of the remaining eligible assets, including XRP, ETH, BAT, BNB, SOL, and AVAX. This means XRP users will get 1.4 billion NIGHT tokens. What individuals will get will depend on their holdings during the snapshot. Thus, ADA and Bitcoin whales eligible for the airdrop will likely get the most NIGHT tokens. Unsurprisingly, ADA and other altcoins have seen a sizable jump in value over the last 24 hours. Eligible airdrop participants will start getting tokens in July Meanwhile, Midnight stated that participants can claim their NIGHT token allocation for the next two months, starting in July. Once this phase has ended, the second phase, Scavenger Mine, will start immediately and last for 30 days, while the Lost and Found phase is set to last for four years. However, all claimed tokens in the first two phases will be locked for a period, with vesting happening at 25% per unlock every 90 days for 360 days. This scheduled unlock has been classified as a Thawing and Redemption Period, and likely implemented to prevent immediate dumping on the part of the claimants. In the next four years, 25% of the claimed tokens will be released across four installments for claimants. Interestingly, claimants can either claim all their allotted tokens using the vesting schedule or wait till the end of the 360 days and claim at once. The claim portal will remain open for another 90 days after the last vesting to allow for redemptions for three extra months.

2025-06-24T19:30:44,"Trump Middle East Stance: Unveiling a Crucial Shift in US Foreign Policy","BitcoinWorld Trump Middle East Stance: Unveiling a Crucial Shift in US Foreign Policy In the ever-unpredictable landscape of global politics, a single statement from a prominent figure can send ripples across continents, impacting everything from diplomatic relations to the very stability of financial markets, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. Recent reports from CNN have brought to light a significant declaration from former U.S. President Donald Trump: his disinclination towards further military engagement in the Middle East. This assertion, if it were to guide future policy, marks a potentially pivotal moment, one that warrants careful examination for anyone navigating the complexities of global markets and assessing the role of assets like Bitcoin. What Does Trump’s Middle East Stance Truly Mean? The recent CNN report, citing former U.S. President Donald Trump, indicates a clear preference: a move away from increased military intervention in the Middle East. This isn’t merely a casual remark; it signals a potential re-evaluation of a cornerstone of Trump Middle East policy that has defined American foreign relations for decades. Historically, the U.S. has maintained a significant military footprint in the region, driven by various factors including oil interests, counter-terrorism efforts, and regional stability. Trump’s statement suggests a desire to significantly alter this paradigm. But what does ‘no more military engagement’ truly entail? Reduced Military Presence: It could mean a significant draw-down of troops and military assets, focusing instead on strategic partnerships and intelligence sharing rather than direct combat roles. Shift in Strategic Priorities: Less emphasis on nation-building or regime change, and more on protecting core U.S. interests, potentially through economic leverage or targeted operations. Emphasis on Diplomatic Solutions: A greater reliance on negotiation, mediation, and multilateral efforts to resolve conflicts, rather than military force as a primary tool. Empowerment of Regional Powers: A scenario where regional allies are encouraged, or even compelled, to take greater responsibility for their own security and regional stability. This approach stands in contrast to the interventionist policies often seen in post-Cold War American history, raising questions about the long-term implications for the region and for America’s global standing. How Might This Reshape US Foreign Policy? For generations, US foreign policy in the Middle East has been characterized by active involvement, often military, to safeguard interests and maintain a delicate balance of power. Trump’s expressed desire to pull back could represent a dramatic departure from this established approach. It raises crucial questions about America’s role as a global superpower and its commitment to long-standing alliances. Such a shift could redefine alliances, create new diplomatic challenges, and alter the global balance of power. Consider the potential contrasts: Feature Traditional US Foreign Policy in Middle East Potential Trump Approach (as per CNN report) Military Footprint Active, significant ground forces, air power, naval presence Reduced, selective, potentially limited to special operations or advisory roles Regional Focus Interventionist, nation-building, maintaining regional order More isolationist, prioritizing domestic concerns, transactional relationships Alliances Strong, supportive of long-term partners, multilateral engagements Transactional, re-evaluated based on perceived direct benefit to U.S., bilateral focus Energy Security Direct military protection of oil routes and production Reliance on global market forces, reduced direct military role This reorientation could necessitate a complete overhaul of diplomatic strategies and intelligence-sharing protocols with key allies like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Gulf states, potentially leading to new regional alignments. What are the Geopolitical Stability Implications? The pursuit of geopolitical stability is a complex dance, and any significant change in the choreography can lead to unpredictable outcomes. On one hand, a reduced U.S. military presence could alleviate tensions stemming from perceived foreign interference, potentially fostering greater regional autonomy and self-reliance. This might lead to: Reduced Financial Burden: A substantial decrease in the billions of dollars spent annually on military operations and maintenance in the region, freeing up resources for domestic priorities. Decreased Anti-American Sentiment: Fewer reasons for resentment or backlash linked to foreign military presence, potentially improving public perception in some areas. Empowerment of Regional Actors: Local powers taking greater ownership of their own security and diplomatic initiatives, fostering a more self-reliant regional order. However, the vacuum created by a U.S. withdrawal could also be filled by other ambitious state or non-state actors, potentially leading to increased regional rivalries, proxy conflicts, or a resurgence of extremist groups. This presents significant challenges to long-term stability. The absence of a strong U.S. deterrent could embolden revisionist powers or lead to an arms race, complicating an already volatile landscape. How Do Global Markets React to Such Shifts? Whenever there’s a significant shift in foreign policy or a rise in geopolitical tensions, global markets often react with immediate volatility. The Middle East, being a crucial hub for energy production and trade routes, holds particular sway. A perceived de-escalation of military involvement could initially be viewed positively, reducing ‘risk premiums’ associated with conflict. However, the uncertainty surrounding the long-term effects of such a policy could also introduce new forms of market anxiety. Key areas of market reaction typically include: Oil Prices: The Middle East is central to global oil supply. A stable, predictable environment could lead to stable or lower oil prices. Conversely, increased regional instability due to a power vacuum could send prices soaring, impacting energy costs worldwide. Stock Markets: Major indices often prefer predictability and stability. A clear, consistent policy, even one of withdrawal, might be welcomed more than prolonged uncertainty. However, sectors tied to defense or international trade could see re-evaluations. Safe-Haven Assets (Gold, Yen, Franc): These traditional safe havens typically see increased demand during times of uncertainty. If Trump’s policy leads to perceived de-escalation, demand might lessen. If it leads to new forms of instability, demand could surge. Currency Markets: The U.S. dollar’s strength is often linked to its role as a global reserve currency and the stability of U.S. foreign policy. Any perceived weakening of U.S. influence could affect its value relative to other major currencies. Investors closely monitor these developments, adjusting their portfolios based on their assessment of risk and opportunity in a changing geopolitical climate. Could Bitcoin Emerge as a True Bitcoin Safe Haven? In times of geopolitical flux, investors often seek refuge in ‘safe-haven’ assets – those expected to retain or increase in value during market turmoil. Traditionally, gold has filled this role. However, in the digital age, the narrative of Bitcoin safe haven has gained considerable traction. The argument is that Bitcoin, being decentralized, borderless, and outside the direct control of any single government or central bank, offers a unique hedge against traditional financial instability and geopolitical risks. During past geopolitical events, Bitcoin’s performance has been a subject of intense debate: Correlation vs. Decoupling: Sometimes, Bitcoin has shown correlation with traditional risk assets (like tech stocks), falling during broader market downturns. At other times, particularly during localized currency crises or heightened geopolitical tensions, it has demonstrated a degree of decoupling, acting as a flight-to-safety asset. For example, during certain phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Bitcoin saw increased adoption in affected regions. Censorship Resistance: Its ability to bypass traditional financial systems makes it attractive in regions facing sanctions or capital controls. Volatility Concerns: Despite its potential, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a significant factor. Its price can swing wildly, which can deter some traditional investors seeking absolute stability. For crypto investors, this shifting geopolitical landscape offers actionable insights: Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin holds potential, it should be considered as part of a diversified portfolio, not a sole safe haven. Monitor Geopolitical News: Stay informed about global events, as they can directly influence market sentiment and crypto prices. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid panic selling during short-term volatility. The long-term narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional system failures might strengthen with continued geopolitical uncertainty. Understand Regional Dynamics: Geopolitical shifts in one region can have unique impacts on crypto adoption and use cases in those specific areas. Donald Trump’s stated desire to reduce military intervention in the Middle East is more than just a political talking point; it’s a potential harbinger of significant shifts in US foreign policy and geopolitical stability . These shifts, in turn, have profound implications for global markets , prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies and consider the evolving role of assets like Bitcoin. While the concept of Bitcoin safe haven is still maturing, its performance during times of uncertainty will continue to be a focal point for the cryptocurrency community, underscoring the interconnectedness of world events and digital finance.

If buyers defend the immediate support at $16, we might see a strong recovery toward $20. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent ETC News/Opinions Arbitrum has activated Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade through ArbOS 40 “Callisto,” introducing powerful features like EIP-7702 for enhanced account abstraction, EIP-2537 for BLS precompiles, and EIP-2935 for improved block hash access.

Specifically, BlackRock withdrew over 11,000 ETH, worth approximately $27.2 million, from Coinbase Prime, according to blockchain data from Arkham Intel on June 24. The transfers came in two parts. The first one emerged at 10:43 UTC and involved 4,224 ETH worth $10.28 million, followed 15 minutes later by 6,961 ETH valued at $16.92 million. Both transactions originated from Coinbase Prime’s hot wallet and were sent to a wallet tied to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). BlackRock Ethereum transaction. Source: Arkham Intel BlackRock’s initial signal to sell ETH The move is especially noteworthy given that just a day earlier, on June 23, BlackRock transferred 9,928 ETH worth around $24.15 million from its ETF wallet to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation of profit-taking or rebalancing. However, the swift reversal suggests a renewed accumulation strategy. This marks one of BlackRock’s largest Ethereum purchases in recent weeks. Just days earlier, on June 20, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF recorded a $19.7 million outflow , the first after 30 consecutive days of inflows. That outflow was also the largest among all Ethereum ETFs, contributing to a net market outflow of $11.3 million. BlackRock’s renewed buying comes amid a broader rebound in institutional crypto activity, following a market-wide selloff driven by Middle East geopolitical tensions. However, markets turned bullish on Monday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, helping Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaim the $105,000 level. Ethereum price analysis As of press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,444, up over 6% in the past 24 hours but still down nearly 2% over the past week. ETH seven-day price chart.

The asset is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2,526.24, indicating short-term weakness but still above the 200-day SMA at $2,364.00, signaling a longer-term bullish bias.

2025-06-24T19:20:22,"Shares of Solana treasury firm Upexi tanks 60%","Upexi shares, trading under the UPXI ticker, took a beating as the U.S. market opened on Tuesday after investors registered 43.85 million shares for resale — stock equal to the company’s initial float in April, which was set aside to fund its Solana treasury plans. The shares have fallen by about 60%, but a prospectus filed on Monday shows that there is more offloading to be done, as buyers have signaled they want to offload 35.97 million common shares plus 7.89 million shares tied to pre-funded warrants. UPXI stocks are down ~60% as markets opened on Tuesday, June 24. Source: Google Finance Upexi will not profit from the share sales The prospectus filed on Monday states that Upexi will collect only $7,890 if holders exercise the warrants and take home from the share sales. “We are not selling any shares of Common Stock in this offering, and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders,” documents sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) read. The Florida-based e-commerce startup made headlines in the past for raising $100 million after outlining a plan to establish a corporate Solana treasury, hoping it would mirror the success from Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. 🚨 NEW: Upexi CEO says the company is doubling down on crypto “With the change in Administration, it seemed like there was an opportunity in crypto after a lot of headwinds.” Full quote from @theflynews 👇 pic.twitter.com/B96XUL1Tmt — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) June 5, 2025 The company purchased its first set of Solana coins on April 29, a total of 45,733 tokens, a few days after completing its public fundraising effort, and one month later, its holdings had reached 679,677 SOL following multiple purchases of discounted vested coins. Investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald shared a $16 price target for Upexi shares in June after it became one of the largest publicly traded Solana holders. The high price target aligns with Cantor’s bias towards Solana, as Cantor analysts see SOL as superior to ETH, its main competitor. Cantor is betting on Upexi and other Solana treasury companies Cantor analysts believe Solana “makes sense” as a treasury asset because it has adequate room for growth based on its market cap, buzzing developer activity, and viral meme culture. Last week, Matthew Sigel shared Cantor Fitzgerald’s initiation of coverage on three major Solana (SOL) treasury businesses: DeFi Development Corp, Upexi, and Sol Strategies, suggesting a bullish outlook. Cantor initiates on Solana treasury companies (HODL CN, DFDV, UPXI) w/ OUTPERFORM ratings.

Then he added that those at Cantor believe “Solana-oriented balance sheets deserve bigger premiums than BTC co’s due to native revenue opportunities & higher volatility.” He shared an excerpt from a report that highlighted Solana as a layer-1 blockchain with superior throughput and lower transaction fees compared to its main rival, Ethereum (ETH). The report compares Bitcoin and Solana, acknowledging that BTC is well-suited as a strategic reserve asset with established market acceptance. It also confirmed Solana’s potential as the technological backbone for transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy. This suggests that analysts at Cantor may see Solana as a utility-driven blockchain rather than a store of value like BTC or a memecoin chain like many degens. The report goes on to argue that Solana treasury companies are betting on a future where financial transactions and applications will predominantly be on-chain, with Solana as the preferred blockchain.

The amended agreement also comes with a fixed interest rate of 9% versus the previous floating rate of between 10.5% and 11.5%. The maturity of the facility was extended to July 16, 2026. “This facility has been an efficient source of capital on our balance sheet,” said Sean Glennan, Hut 8’s chief financial officer. “The combination of improved terms and collateral and borrower protections reflects our conviction that risk discipline is essential to building a resilient and efficient capital structure.” Unlike many traditional loans, this one is secured by bitcoin holdings. Coinbase, however, is restricted from rehypothecating the collateral, a measure that limits counterparty risk. The credit line also includes a limited recourse clause, further shielding Hut 8. The company said it will use the additional $65 million in capital to pursue expansion efforts. HUT shares are higher by 7.7% on Tuesday alongside gains for most of the bitcoin mining sector.

2025-06-24T19:18:36,"WazirX Gets Final Shot: Singapore Court Extends $234M Crypto Moratorium","The Singapore High Court has extended WazirX’s legal moratorium and granted the Indian cryptocurrency exchange a final chance to present arguments for its proposed restructuring plan. The decision comes nearly one year after a $234 million hack and months of silence that left users waiting for clarity on fund recovery. Court Grants Moratorium Extension Amid WazirX Restructuring Struggles Today, WazirX confirmed via its official X account that the Singapore High Court had accepted its request to present further arguments in support of its restructuring plan. The same ruling extended the moratorium on legal claims, which originally expired on June 6, 2025, until the court hears and rules on the new arguments. Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court's sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium granted in HC/OA 1284/2024… pic.twitter.com/QdozZHnWVX — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 24, 2025 The moratorium shields WazirX from legal action while it restructures. The extension offers the exchange one more opportunity to gain formal court approval for its Scheme of Arrangement, a legal process to reorganize operations and settle obligations. The court had previously declined to sanction WazirX’s proposal, citing transparency concerns about its parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd. In response, WazirX proposed relocating operations to Panama under a newly formed entity called Zensui Corporation. Singapore High Court rejects WazirX’s restructuring plan after parent company secretly rebrands and moves to Panama. This paves the way for Indian users to pursue legal action for their lost funds. What’s next for the hacked exchange? #WazirX #Zettai https://t.co/HDEmrYzdf6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Meanwhile, the July 18, 2024, breach was one of the largest crypto exchange hacks of the year, resulting in the loss of $234 million in digital assets. Since then, WazirX users have remained without access to their funds. The company initially pledged to return 85% of user balances, but progress has been stalled by legal challenges, vague communication, and investor objections. In its latest post, WazirX stated, “We are currently awaiting directions from the Court on the next steps and will keep you informed as soon as we have more clarity.” The update offered no concrete timelines for hearings, rulings, or user repayments. As part of its restructuring plan, WazirX plans to issue recovery tokens, on-chain IOUs representing unrecovered funds. “We will issue RT tokens and use them to distribute any future recovered funds to token holders,” WazirX CEO said. #WazirX #CryptoHack #AssetRecovery https://t.co/5YoXtIppwX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 11, 2025 These tokens are designed to help users claim between 75% and 80% of their hacked balances, depending on market conditions. However, the tokens remain speculative, and user confidence is waning. Legal and Community Pressures Mount Although more than 93% of voting creditors approved the restructuring plan in April 2025, legal complications and resistance from Zettai Pte Ltd have delayed implementation. Users and crypto community members have increasingly voiced frustration over the lack of transparency. Meanwhile, WazirX has not provided updates since the court’s earlier rejection, and many expected a final decision on the restructuring by June 20. With that date passed and no verdict announced, the latest extension feels like another pause rather than progress for affected users. In February, WazirX had earlier outlined two possible repayment outcomes , depending on whether its proposed restructuring plan is approved or rejected. The exchange warned that repayments could be delayed until 2030 if the court rejects the plan, potentially forcing the company into liquidation. A successful restructuring would allow for a faster, structured repayment process, possibly including profit-sharing benefits. In contrast, liquidation would involve lengthy legal proceedings, higher costs, and reduced payouts.

2025-06-24T19:10:44,"Trump Media’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy: A $400M Buyback Amidst Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Trump Media’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy: A $400M Buyback Amidst Market Volatility In a fascinating intersection of traditional finance, media, and cutting-edge digital assets, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has made headlines with a dual announcement that has investors and crypto enthusiasts buzzing. The company, known for its Truth Social platform, is embarking on a substantial share buyback program while reaffirming its ambitious Bitcoin strategy. What does this mean for the future of DJT stock, and what are the broader implications for corporate crypto adoption? Understanding Trump Media’s Financial Maneuver Trump Media , trading under the ticker DJT, recently unveiled plans to repurchase up to $400 million of its own shares. This move, often seen as a vote of confidence from a company’s management, signals a belief that the stock is undervalued and that buying back shares will ultimately benefit existing shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares, thus increasing earnings per share. What is a Share Buyback and Why Do Companies Do It? A share buyback, or share repurchase, is a strategy used by companies to reacquire their own outstanding shares from the open market. Here’s why companies typically engage in them: Boosting Shareholder Value: By reducing the number of shares in circulation, each remaining share represents a larger percentage of the company’s ownership, potentially increasing its value. Signaling Confidence: It sends a strong message to investors that the company believes its stock is undervalued, and management is confident in future prospects. Improving Financial Metrics: Key metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE) can improve as the denominator (number of shares) decreases. Returning Capital to Shareholders: It’s an alternative to dividends for distributing profits to investors, often preferred by companies that want to maintain financial flexibility. Offsetting Dilution: Can counteract the dilutive effect of stock options or restricted stock units granted to employees. For Trump Media , this $400 million buyback is a significant financial commitment, especially for a relatively young publicly traded entity. It suggests the company is looking to stabilize its valuation and perhaps reward long-term investors. The Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy: A $2.3 Billion Vision Perhaps even more intriguing than the buyback is Trump Media’s unwavering commitment to its previously announced Bitcoin strategy . The company confirmed that the share repurchase program will not impact its ambitious plan to establish a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury. This strategy, which recently received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), positions DJT as a notable player in the growing trend of corporate crypto adoption. Why a Media Company Needs a Bitcoin Treasury? The decision for a media company like Trump Media to hold such a substantial amount of Bitcoin in its treasury is unconventional, yet it aligns with a broader, albeit nascent, trend among forward-thinking corporations. Here are some potential motivations: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, particularly given its decentralized nature and fixed supply, which stands in contrast to fiat currencies. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and its readiness to participate in the evolving digital economy. This could attract tech-savvy investors and users. Diversification of Assets: Holding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional cash and equivalents, potentially offering higher returns, albeit with higher risk. Attracting a Specific Demographic: For a platform like Truth Social, appealing to users who are already interested in cryptocurrencies could be a strategic move to grow its user base and foster a vibrant community. Potential for Future Integration: While not explicitly stated, a significant Bitcoin treasury could pave the way for future crypto-related services, such as accepting Bitcoin for payments, integrating NFTs, or exploring Web3 functionalities on the Truth Social platform. SEC Approval: A Milestone for Corporate Crypto Adoption? The U.S. SEC’s approval of Trump Media’s Bitcoin treasury plan is a significant development. It suggests a degree of regulatory acceptance for large-scale corporate holdings of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. While the SEC’s stance on various crypto assets remains complex, this approval could set a precedent or at least provide some clarity for other companies considering similar moves. It highlights that with proper disclosures and adherence to regulatory frameworks, even substantial crypto strategies can pass muster with financial regulators. The Volatile Ride of DJT Stock Despite these strategic announcements, the journey for DJT stock has been anything but smooth. Reports indicate that DJT shares have seen a significant decline, down approximately 30% since the announcement of its crypto initiative. This volatility raises important questions: What’s Driving the DJT Stock Performance? Market Reaction to Crypto Exposure: While some investors view Bitcoin favorably, others may be wary of the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. A large Bitcoin treasury introduces a new layer of risk that traditional investors might find unappealing, leading to sell-offs. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards growth stocks and speculative assets can also influence DJT’s performance. Company Fundamentals: Beyond crypto, investors scrutinize the company’s core business performance, user growth, revenue generation, and profitability. Initial enthusiasm might wane if these fundamentals don’t meet expectations. Post-SPAC Volatility: DJT went public via a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) merger, which often results in significant price swings in the initial months as the market tries to find a stable valuation. Public Perception and Political Affiliation: As a company associated with a prominent political figure, DJT’s stock can be subject to unique market dynamics influenced by political events and public sentiment, which might not always align with traditional financial metrics. The 30% drop, as reported by The Block, underscores the market’s mixed reactions to the company’s bold strategic direction. It’s a reminder that while innovation can be rewarded, it also comes with increased scrutiny and potential for short-term price fluctuations. Challenges and Opportunities for Corporate Crypto Adoption Trump Media’s strategy serves as a case study for the broader landscape of corporate crypto adoption . While the potential benefits are clear, there are significant hurdles: Key Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can swing wildly, directly impacting the value of a company’s treasury and potentially its balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite SEC approval for this specific plan, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving across different jurisdictions. Accounting and Tax Complexities: Handling crypto assets on a corporate balance sheet introduces complex accounting and tax implications that require specialized expertise. Security Concerns: Storing and managing large amounts of digital assets requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public and Investor Perception: Some traditional investors may view crypto holdings as speculative or risky, impacting investor confidence and stock valuation. Emerging Opportunities: Pioneering New Business Models: Companies embracing crypto early can explore new revenue streams, payment methods, and user engagement models. Attracting Talent: Being at the forefront of crypto innovation can attract top talent interested in working with cutting-edge technologies. Enhanced Brand Image: For certain brands, adopting crypto can enhance their image as innovative, forward-thinking, and technologically advanced. Access to New Capital Pools: The crypto market represents a vast pool of capital and a distinct investor base that companies can tap into. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors considering DJT stock or any company with significant crypto exposure, due diligence is paramount. Understand not just the company’s core business, but also its crypto strategy, risk management protocols, and how these assets are accounted for. For businesses contemplating their own foray into corporate crypto adoption, Trump Media’s experience offers valuable lessons: Start Small and Scale: Unless you’re a major player, consider a phased approach to crypto integration. Understand Regulatory Landscape: Consult legal and financial experts familiar with crypto regulations in your operating regions. Robust Security is Non-Negotiable: Invest heavily in secure storage solutions (cold storage, multi-signature wallets) and cybersecurity protocols. Communicate Clearly: Transparently communicate your crypto strategy to investors and stakeholders, explaining the rationale and risk mitigation. Align with Business Goals: Ensure your crypto strategy genuinely supports your overall business objectives and isn’t just a speculative bet. The Road Ahead for Trump Media and Corporate Crypto Trump Media’s dual strategy of a substantial share buyback and an unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin strategy positions it at a unique and potentially pivotal point. The $400 million buyback signals confidence in its traditional valuation, while the $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury approved by the SEC underscores a bold vision for the future, embracing digital assets as a core component of its financial health. While the recent 30% dip in DJT stock highlights the market’s cautious reaction to its crypto exposure, it also sets the stage for a compelling narrative. Will Trump Media’s gamble on Bitcoin pay off, leading to long-term value creation and pioneering a new path for media companies? Or will the volatility of the crypto market continue to challenge its share performance? Regardless of the outcome, Trump Media’s approach serves as a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto adoption . It pushes the boundaries of how traditional businesses interact with digital assets, offering valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for companies brave enough to integrate cryptocurrencies into their core strategies. The coming months will undoubtedly reveal more about the wisdom of this bold financial and strategic play.

2025-06-24T19:00:53,"Moscow Exchange prepares to launch Bitcoin index futures","Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, will offer a new crypto futures contract, this time based on its own recently introduced Bitcoin index. The announcement comes after the exchange registered increased investor interest in its first such product issued earlier in June and based on a well-known Bitcoin ETF. Moscow Exchange to launch Bitcoin index futures The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) will soon present Russian investors with a new crypto derivative, its Managing Director, Vladimir Krekoten, unveiled in an interview with the business news portal RBC published on Tuesday. The platform’s own Moscow Exchange PFI Bitcoin Index (MOEXBTC), first calculated on June 10, will serve as the underlying asset for the new instrument, the executive further revealed. This will be the second offering of this kind by MOEX after it started trading Bitcoin futures earlier this month. On June 4, the exchange launched a futures contract for the Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) of American investment giant BlackRock. Krekoten explained the decision to expand the lineup with investor demand. At the end of the first day of trading, the Bitcoin futures volume exceeded 420 million Russian rubles (over $5.3 million). The top manager detailed: “Since then, the trading volume has amounted to a total of almost 7 billion rubles. Over 10,000 qualified investors have made transactions with it.” The figures are similar to those for some instruments that have been traded on the exchange for several months, the report noted. Krekoten emphasized: “Yes, we see interest now … These are very good indicators for such a short period of time the instrument has been in circulation on the market.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the largest Bitcoin ETF by capital under management. According to data from the crypto investment research platform Sosovalue, it holds more than $70 billion in Bitcoin, accounting for over half of the capital of all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs as of June 23. Spot ETFs based on Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, provide exposure to crypto assets through shares offered on major exchanges such as NASDAQ and the NYSE. To issue the shares, the funds need to buy Bitcoin. Demand for these products created a significant influx of capital into the crypto market and became a major driver for growth last year. MOEX plans to offer more crypto-related products The Moscow Exchange intends to also launch mutual funds and structured bonds focused on cryptocurrency indices. According to the RBC report, this is currently being discussed with capital management companies. Vladimir Krekoten remarked that the needed infrastructure is already in place. At the same time, he stressed that the development of this segment will depend on both market demand and the attitude of financial regulators in the Russian Federation. The Central Bank of Russia’s decision to authorize the offering of crypto derivatives sparked a race between major players in the financial sector, including MOEX, Russia’s largest bank, Sber, and the Russian broker Finam. Sberbank has already issued structured bonds, the yield of which is tied to the value of Bitcoin and takes into account fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Russian ruble and the U.S. dollar. The bonds are listed on the Moscow Exchange. All cryptocurrency derivatives are currently available exclusively to “highly qualified” investors. The criteria to fall in this category are yet to be officially approved but it’s clear that the products are not meant for ordinary Russians. In March, the Bank of Russia proposed a threshold of 100 million rubles ($1.25 million) in securities or deposits, as well as 50 million rubles in annual income, for private individuals who want to acquire crypto assets and derivatives under Russia’s special “experimental legal regime.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-24T19:00:44,"Iranian Retaliation: Escalation and Crypto Market Uncertainty","BitcoinWorld Iranian Retaliation: Escalation and Crypto Market Uncertainty The global stage is once again witnessing heightened tensions, with significant implications for financial landscapes worldwide, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Recent reports indicate that a senior Iranian official has reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to continued Iranian retaliation against U.S. attacks, as reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X. This declaration sends ripples across various sectors, prompting investors to re-evaluate strategies and consider the potential for increased market volatility. Understanding the Drivers of Iranian Retaliation The announcement of ongoing Iranian retaliation is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a complex geopolitical narrative. Such statements underscore the volatile nature of international relations, where actions and counter-actions can escalate rapidly. For those observing global financial markets, these developments are critical indicators. The initial report, disseminated via a widely followed economic news account, quickly captured attention due to its direct implications for regional stability and, by extension, global energy prices and investor confidence. Official Stance: A senior Iranian official explicitly stated the intent to continue retaliatory measures. Source Credibility: The information comes from the Walter Bloomberg economic news account, known for its rapid dissemination of market-moving headlines. Historical Context: This follows a period of escalating friction between Iran and the U.S., with a history of tit-for-tat actions. How Does Heightened Geopolitical Tension Affect Global Finance? When geopolitical tension rises, it rarely remains confined to political arenas. Its effects spill over into economies, influencing everything from oil prices to stock market performance. The interconnectedness of global finance means that instability in one region can trigger a domino effect. Investors often seek safe-haven assets during such times, or, conversely, may pull back from riskier ventures. The Middle East, being a crucial energy hub, means any instability there has immediate global economic ramifications. Consider these points regarding the broader impact: Area of Impact Description Oil Prices Increased tension in the Middle East often leads to supply concerns, driving crude oil prices higher. Traditional Markets Stock markets may experience sell-offs as investors de-risk, while bonds and gold might see increased demand. Trade Routes Disruptions to shipping lanes or air travel can impact global supply chains and trade. Currency Markets Major currencies might fluctuate as capital flows seek perceived safety. Navigating Market Volatility in the Crypto Space The cryptocurrency sector, known for its inherent dynamism, is particularly susceptible to external shocks. Periods of heightened market volatility , often triggered by significant geopolitical events, can lead to rapid price swings. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ sometimes acts as a hedge against traditional financial instability, but it can also behave as a risk asset, moving in tandem with equities during broader market downturns. Understanding these dual characteristics is key for crypto investors. In times of uncertainty, we often observe: Bitcoin’s Reaction: Depending on the narrative, Bitcoin might see inflows as a perceived safe haven, or it might decline alongside traditional risk assets if the broader market sentiment turns negative. Altcoin Performance: Smaller, less liquid altcoins tend to experience more extreme price movements during periods of high volatility, often amplifying Bitcoin’s moves. Trading Volumes: Increased uncertainty typically leads to higher trading volumes as participants react to news and price changes. What This Means for Crypto Markets The ongoing narrative of Iranian retaliation and its potential to escalate geopolitical tension directly influences crypto markets . While cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional financial systems to some extent, they are not immune to macro-economic forces or shifts in global investor sentiment . The fear of broader conflict can lead to a flight of capital from speculative assets, or, conversely, drive some investors towards decentralized alternatives. Consider the following potential scenarios for crypto markets: Risk-Off Environment: If geopolitical fears intensify, a general risk-off sentiment could prevail, leading to selling pressure across crypto assets, similar to traditional equities. Safe-Haven Narrative: A strong push towards Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ could emerge if investors lose faith in fiat currencies or traditional safe havens. Increased Regulation Scrutiny: Periods of global instability sometimes prompt governments to increase scrutiny on financial flows, potentially impacting crypto. Protecting Your Portfolio: Analyzing Investor Sentiment In an environment shaped by the threat of continued Iranian retaliation and the resultant geopolitical tension , understanding and reacting to shifts in investor sentiment becomes paramount. Emotional responses often drive market movements during uncertain times. For crypto investors, maintaining a rational approach is crucial. This involves not just monitoring news, but also having a clear strategy for risk management. Actionable insights for navigating this period: Diversification: Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio to mitigate risks associated with specific assets. Risk Assessment: Re-evaluate your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Avoid over-leveraging. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments from reliable sources, understanding their potential impact on global markets. Long-Term View: For long-term holders, short-term volatility might present accumulation opportunities, but only if fundamental convictions remain strong. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your crypto holdings are stored securely in cold wallets, especially during times of heightened uncertainty. A Compelling Summary: Navigating Uncharted Waters The declaration of continued Iranian retaliation against U.S. attacks serves as a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected global events are. This heightened geopolitical tension is a significant factor contributing to broader market volatility , which inevitably spills over into crypto markets . For investors, understanding these dynamics and carefully analyzing shifts in investor sentiment is not just beneficial but essential. While the future remains uncertain, a well-informed and strategic approach can help navigate these turbulent waters. Staying vigilant, exercising caution, and making decisions based on thorough analysis rather than emotion will be key to safeguarding your investments in these challenging times.

The outspoken real estate investor notes that Cardone Capital added approximately 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet. Cardone says the firm is the “first ever real estate/BTC company integrated with full BTC strategy, combining the two best-in-class assets.” He also says the firm plans to add another 3,000 BTC to its balance sheet this year. With BTC trading at $105,400 at time of writing, Cardone Capital’s 1,000 BTC investment is currently worth $105.4 million.

Cardone says the concept of saving money will just cause investors to lose purchasing power. “You can NOT save money! You either spend it, lose it or invest it. There is NO such thing as saving. Every US Dollar should come with ‘saver beware’ warning, ‘The purchasing power of this note will decline in purchasing value.'” Cardone Capital currently sports a portfolio of more than 14,200 units with a total value of $5.5 billion, per the firm’s LinkedIn account.

In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says retail traders appear to be taking the recent uncertainty as an opportunity to continue buying the familiar names they had already accumulated in the past, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and crypto-related equities. “I was a little bit surprised that over the weekend, when all this was happening, the markets didn’t move so much in the overnight. I don’t know if you were surprised by that, but I feel like if this had happened a year or two years ago, we would have had a huge move, but markets were flat to even a little bit up. And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Besides the top ten biggest stocks, Tanev also says there’s been interest in stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), telehealth company Hims and Hers (HIMS), and oil futures. “There’s been a lot of interest in Circle (CRCL), I think that [Hims and Hers (HIMS)] had a big move yesterday – when you have a big move like that around news, you always have retail and institutional jumping in – so I wouldn’t say it’s just the top ten, there’s new things coming all the time, and now we have futures trading, so we did see some heightened activity around crude oil. But the futures traders have always been trading that, so I would say, broad-based equities and crypto, it’s pretty similar to how it was last week. High volumes, but no huge shifts as a result of the conflict.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-24T18:30:26,"Nano Labs Raises $500M in Debt Notes in $1B BNB Push","China-based Web 3.0 company Nano Labs has secured up to $500 million through a convertible notes deal with multiple investors. The funding kicks off a bigger plan to invest heavily in BNB, one of the top digital assets. This move follows a growing trend where crypto firms and Web 3 startups are increasing their holdings of digital currencies. Nano Labs’ $500M Convertible Notes Agreement On June 24, Nano Labs announced it would issue convertible promissory notes totaling $500 million. Several investors have already committed to buying these notes, which will not earn interest and mature 360 days after being issued. During that time, investors can convert their notes into the company’s Class A ordinary shares. The conversion price is reportedly set at $20 per share but may change as described in the agreement. If not converted, the full amount must be repaid at the end of the 360-day term. These notes are unsecured, meaning company assets do not back them. The agreement is still subject to standard closing conditions. Also, the transaction will not be completed in full. Investors are advised to take this into account when considering this update. Strategic Growth Through BNB Acquisition This agreement is more than just a funding move. It is part of Nano Labs’ larger plan to strengthen its presence in Web 3.0. A key part of this strategy is a deep dive into BNB, a major blockchain asset. Nano Labs, which began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2024, plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of BNB through convertible notes and private deals. The company eventually hopes to own 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. The company shared that a full security and value assessment of BNB will be carried out in the early stages of this plan. With this agreement, Nano Labs is signaling strong confidence in blockchain infrastructure and digital assets. The company believes this move will support its long-term goals and growth in the Web 3.0 ecosystem. A Broader Industry Trend Nano Labs’ plan to build a BNB treasury using convertible notes is not a one-off move. More companies across the crypto and tech space are starting to include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB in their business strategies. Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy is leading this trend. The company raised funds using several methods, including selling shares and issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Today, Strategy holds more Bitcoin than almost any other public company. Its strong market performance has caught the attention of other companies. Firms like Metaplanet, MARA, and not limited to Semler Scientific have also started adding Bitcoin to their financial reserves.

With over $10 million raised in pre-sale and surging demand from both retail and institutional investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a hidden gem—it’s a top contender for the next major breakout . The question now: Can Arbitrum (ARB) join this elite group? MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the pre-sale landscape with a structure and momentum rarely seen in 2025. Analysts are already projecting 75x–100x returns upon listing. This rare combination is steering capital away from traditional altcoins and into MAGACOIN FINANCE, positioning it firmly among the top gainers of the year , alongside Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP.

Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP: Market Leaders Still Delivering Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, with 2025 targets between $180,000 and $250,000 , thanks to institutional inflows and ETF momentum. Solana continues gaining ground with a rapidly growing ecosystem and projections as high as $1,000 . Meanwhile, XRP benefits from strong legal positioning and ETF expectations, pushing analyst targets to as much as $19 . While these giants drive stability, their scale limits short-term upside, making emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE even more appealing. Is Arbitrum (ARB) Next? Arbitrum (ARB) is showing signs of revival, hovering between $0.37–$0.39 in June 2025. With upgraded Layer-2 solutions and renewed community interest, some forecasts suggest a rebound to $0.65–$2.76 by year-end.

2025-06-24T18:30:00,"COIN Act: a new turn in the Democrats battle v Trump’s cryptocurrency business?","Sen. Adam Schiff from the Democratic Party introduced a new bill, the COIN Act, aimed at blocking U.S. Presidents and their families from promoting or launching cryptocurrency ventures. Why did Democrats come up with a new bill, and what is at stake for Donald Trump? Table of Contents The new act Burgeoning crypto empire of the Trumps Future of the COIN Act The new act The full name of the bill introduced by Adam Schiff is Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure Act. The new act is not explicitly aimed at ruining Trump’s cryptocurrency business. Rather, it bans all the sitting presidents, vice presidents, and their immediate family members (siblings, spouses, and children) from using their privileged position in the crypto space and other financial spaces. On top of cryptocurrencies, the act regulates (bans) endorsements and issuance of securities, commodities, and futures. The act bars top officials and their families from endorsing crypto projects and other assets and using the likeness of their names or images for the promotion of crypto ventures. The legislation is also blocking the issuance and sponsorship of assets. The COIN Act does not prohibit presidents and their families from purchasing, holding, and sending cryptocurrencies. Crypto assets held by senior officials are subject to disclosures just like other financial assets. Violators are penalized and are subjected to disgorgement of their illegal profit to the Treasury of the U.S. If the violation led to an aggregate loss of $1,000,000 or more to a citizen or several citizens of the U.S. or if the assets were used for bribery, violators can be subjected to criminal prosecution. Understandably, insider trading and fraud are also banned. Democrats have tried to push similar regulations before. In the spring of 2025, they tried to add clauses that would ban Trump from the crypto business to the Genius Act, regulating stablecoins. However, Democrats didn’t succeed in amending the bill. Seemingly, that was the reason for creating a new one, fully dedicated to the ties of the top officials with the business. Read more: Senate crypto bill collapses: Is partisan divide or Trump’s digital fortune to blame? Burgeoning crypto empire of the Trumps As Trump and his family are closely tied to several cryptocurrency projects, the COIN Act threatens their well-being. Adam Schiff makes it clear in a video he posted on X. Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 In the video, Schiff says that from Trump’s recent financial disclosure , we learned that the POTUS has gained substantial amounts of money from selling branded goods with this image or name on them (including the Trump-labeled Bible). However, Schiff continues, the most lucrative source of income for Trump and his family is the “cryptocurrency scheme.” One of the elements of this scheme is the Official Trump memecoin (the proceeds from this venture are not subjected to disclosures, as Trump launched the token before the inauguration). Another element of the scheme mentioned by Schiff is the stablecoin USD1 launched by World Liberty Finance, a company closely tied to Donald Trump and his sons, Donald and Eric. Through his involvement in World Liberty Finance, Donald Trump alone made $57 million in the first quarter of 2025. The COIN Act threatens these ventures, as its ban on involvement in the crypto business stretches from 180 days pre-term to two years following the end of the term. It would make proceedings from memecoins Official Trump and Melania illegal, as well as the Trump family’s involvement in World Liberty Finance. In January 2025, Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company behind Truth Social, announced it would allocate $250 million in cryptocurrencies through a new platform Truth.Fi. Eric Trump is the chief strategic officer of the new mining venture American Bitcoin. In May, the company announced it was going public . 98% of the company belongs to Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Future of the COIN Act Schiff supported the GENIUS Act despite the fact that the restrictions for crypto businesses for senior officials were omitted from the bill. Generally, it shows that Schiff is not going to serve as a hurdle for crypto innovation in the U.S., while he is still concerned about eye-popping Trump’s conflict of interest. As of the press time, the COIN Act has the support of nine Senate Democrats. It is too early to judge if the proposal will see success. Previously, Republicans showed no interest in limiting Trump’s involvement in the crypto business, so the COIN Act may be rejected just like the amendments to the GENIUS Act that were denied before. However, time will show if this defining bill will become the rule.

Trump posted the peace claims on Truth Social after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Prediction market Polymarket registered a 99% likelihood of a ceasefire shortly after the announcement. Polymarket is in talks to raise $200 million at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. Bitcoin price has recovered to the $105,000 level today, after the truce announcement made by U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23.

The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures,” stated Trump on social media. “They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE,” he wrote. ""CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE…"" –President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/hLTBT34KnG — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 23, 2025 The ceasefire came after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar. The retaliation has not caused substantial damage or casualties. Since Trump announced the ceasefire, Israel has accused Iran of initiating another round of attacks. Iran denied the claimed attack. “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave’ to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!” wrote Trump. On the cryptocurrency-based prediction site Polymarket , the possibility of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has jumped to 99% from the previous 8% on June 23. The chance of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal remains fluctuating with a current Polymarket possibility of 44%. “IRAN WILL NEVER REBUILD THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES!” said Trump. Polymarket Users Bet on Peace as Platform Eyes $200M Raise According to The Information , Polymarket is in talks to raise $200 million in the latest round of funding with a valuation of over $1 billion. The decentralized platform raised $70 million from two recent rounds in May, including a Series A of $20 million led by General Catalyst and a $45 million Series B funding round led by Founders Fund. Bitcoin’s sharp reaction has revived discussion about its use as a geopolitical risk asset. Traders moved quickly following the ceasefire news, reinforcing the view that crypto can respond faster than traditional markets during global uncertainty. Polymarket’s activity represents growing interest in decentralized tools for gauging political outcomes. The platform’s rising volume suggests users are turning to crypto-based prediction markets for faster insights on diplomacy, conflict, and major international decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Polymarket different from traditional prediction tools? Polymarket uses blockchain infrastructure to settle predictions on-chain, providing transparent odds and rapid resolution of outcomes. How does Polymarket maintain credibility and accuracy? Outcomes on Polymarket are resolved using third-party oracles and predefined criteria, reducing subjective intervention. Disputes are resolved via decentralized governance, which supports integrity and transparency. Could Polymarket’s growth lead to regulatory scrutiny? As the platform gains traction and funding, it may attract attention from U.S. regulators, especially given the uncertain legal classification of prediction markets in jurisdictions like the United States.

2025-06-24T18:25:08,"Here’s the Current Status of the Altcoin Season Index – Analyst Takes an In-Depth Look at Potential Altcoin Bull Run","Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch drew attention to Bitcoin's market dominance in his assessment and warned about the upcoming altcoin season. According to Koch, for altcoin seasons to begin, Bitcoin’s market dominance rate must first reach a cycle peak. This rate peaked at around 70% in previous bull markets. It is currently around 66% and is trending upward. The US attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend has raised tensions in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump described the operation as a “complete success”, while the Iranian government reacted by accusing the US of crossing red lines and declaring that all US bases in the region were potential targets. Iran also threatened to halt maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz. These developments increased the perception of risk in financial markets. As in traditional crisis periods, investors turned to safe havens (gold, oil, and in this case Bitcoin) instead of risky assets (such as altcoins). This increased Bitcoin's market dominance, reaching 66%, the highest level in recent years. This increase is considered the biggest obstacle to the start of the altcoin season. However, Iran subsequently hit the US base in Qatar with prior notice and reduced tensions. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio between the market value of Bitcoin and the total value of the entire cryptocurrency market. When this ratio increases, it means that the vast majority of investors are holding their money in Bitcoin. When it decreases, capital is shifting towards altcoins. This shift is seen as one of the main signs of altcoin season. “Bitcoin dominance usually peaks towards the end of bull cycles and then declines. Along with this decline, altcoins experience sudden and sharp increases,” said analyst Simeon Koch. However, he added that this period carries serious risks despite the high profit potential. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List a New Surprise Altcoin Koch stated that technical indicators show that a peak formation is approaching in Bitcoin dominance. Indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index) are in the overbought region. In addition, the inverse correlation of the global liquidity index also indicates that there may be a decrease in dominance in the near future. If this scenario occurs, it is stated that the altcoin season may begin with the capital rotation shifting to altcoins. According to the analyst, when past cycles are examined, it is seen that the altcoin season usually begins in periods when Bitcoin dominance has been continuously falling for several weeks or months. During these periods, major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP outperform Bitcoin, indicating that investors' risk appetite has increased. Tools like the Altcoin Season Index are also used to track this. This index indicates that an altcoin season has begun if 75% of the largest altcoins have risen more than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 16, indicating Bitcoin’s continued dominance. Koch noted that altcoin season is the period when the highest gains are seen in the crypto market, but also carries the highest risks: “Investors may want to get on the track when the music is playing loudest. But it is also necessary to see the exit in time. The altcoin season ends at its peak, and a severe bear market may follow immediately.” *This is not investment advice.

Major U.S. stock indices rose after the announced ceasefire between Israel and Iran. On Tuesday, June 24, Dow Jones was up 470 points or 1.1%, reclaiming its levels before the 12-day war started. At the same time, the S&P 500 was up 1.05%, and the tech-focused Nasdaq was up 1.43%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Driving the markets were hopes that the conflict between Iran and Israel would cease for now. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries. Moreover, he pressured Israel to stop its attacks against Iran, which promised hope for an end to the war. The escalation of a broader conflict threatened the global oil economy. This was particularly true after the U.S. got directly involved with its own strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. After these strikes, Iran even threatened to push the price of oil to its historic levels by closing the Strait of Hormuz. The price of crude oil dropped back down to $64 per barrel, down 5.33% in just one day. Crude oil traded near $75 at the height of the crisis, the highest price since January this year. Lower oil prices are good news for the global macro outlook as they could lead to cooling inflation.

In particular, Powell is concerned by the potential effects of Trump’s tariffs, which could both push inflation up and lower growth.

2025-06-24T18:21:09,"Major Banks Try to Avoid Trump’s Crosshairs – What This Means for Crypto?","Key Takeaways: Banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup, are revising internal policies following pressure from Republican state governments. Texas and Oklahoma have barred certain financial institutions from state contracts over alleged bias against the fossil fuel and firearms industries. The Trump administration may issue an executive order restricting “debanking” on political or religious grounds. JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are taking steps to address concerns raised by Republican-led states over alleged political bias, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on June 24. The banks have held meetings with officials in Texas and Oklahoma to respond to accusations that they limit services to industries such as fossil fuels and firearms. Some of these states have blacklisted banks from contracts over policies perceived as discriminatory. Banks Scale Back “Woke” Policies “I’m not asking them to be MAGA banks,” said Todd Russ, Oklahoma’s state treasurer. “I want them to manage my portfolio and stay out of these political ideologies. I think they realize that’s a fair place to be.” Citigroup recently ended a policy that restricted business with firearms vendors selling to buyers under 21, a move discussed during a meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. JPMorgan and others have updated their policies to clarify that they do not base decisions on political views. Banks have also withdrawn from climate alliances targeted by Republican officials. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and others are reevaluating restrictions on coal-related activities. Bank of America lifted a ban on coal financing last year. At the federal level, the Trump administration is reportedly considering an executive order to prevent “debanking” based on political or religious views. This order could impact banks’ ability to engage in government business, including selling Treasury bonds. In Congress, Republican senators have proposed legislation barring regulators from using reputational risk as a factor in exams. The Federal Reserve recently announced it would no longer apply that standard, following direction from Trump-aligned officials. Trump Expands Crypto Push Against the backdrop of rising tensions between major financial institutions and Republican leadership, Trump’s expanding crypto activity introduces another potential fault line. By backing a Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF under the Truth Social brand, his media group is positioning itself at odds with institutions under scrutiny for ESG-linked decisions or perceived political biases. ""Welcome to the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit. Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world, AND WE'RE TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE."" –President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/nqUrHQ1xLl — President Donald J. Trump (@POTUS) March 8, 2025 Unlike traditional banks now adjusting policies to avoid state blacklists, Trump’s ventures are embracing digital assets with overt political branding. This contrast may appeal to constituents who feel underserved or penalized by large financial firms.

In a new interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, McInerney says Visa has long been preparing for the greater adoption of stablecoins. “We’ve been embracing and building for years, preparing for this moment. The GENIUS Act has now passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House. I think that will give regulatory clarity [for] stablecoins. And we’ve been embracing stablecoins. We’ve been enabling people to issue Visa credentials on top of stablecoins, we’ve been modernizing our own settlement infrastructure with stablecoins and we have a whole host of innovations that we plan to deploy around the world embracing stablecoins.” While Visa’s stock declined after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, McInerney says that Visa could enable stablecoin use across its payments network if there’s a demand for it. “For payments, you need three things. You need trust, you need ease of use and you need scale. And the reason why we have close to 5 billion Visa credentials around the world, the reason why we have 14 billion Visa tokens around the world and the reason why 150 million merchants around the world depend on Visa to grow their businesses is because nobody does that better than Visa. And if stablecoins become a mode of currency that people want to embrace around the world we will enable that on the Visa system and scale that to those billions of end points. That’s what you need to do well in payments, that’s what Visa does better than anybody in the world.” Visa is trading for $350 at time of writing, down from its 52-week high of $375.

2025-06-24T18:00:18,"Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply","Bitcoin is trading above the $105,000 level after a sharp rebound triggered by the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical relief provided a strong tailwind for risk assets, and BTC responded with a powerful surge, regaining a critical psychological level that had previously flipped into resistance. Now, as bulls regain momentum, Bitcoin is flirting with a potential breakout above the $110,000 mark — a key level that capped rallies throughout June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction This renewed strength comes after several days of volatility and fear, where BTC dipped to as low as $98,200 amid escalating conflict in the Middle East. However, the swift recovery has shifted sentiment back in favor of the bulls. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, there has been a heavy spike in Taker Buy Volume over the past 48 hours — a strong signal that aggressive market participants are stepping in with conviction. These buy-side imbalances suggest that institutional and high-conviction traders are positioning for further upside. As the market heats up and risk appetite grows, a breakout above the $110K resistance could confirm the start of a new bullish impulse. For now, all eyes are on whether BTC can hold and extend above current levels. Bitcoin Faces Uncertainty As Bulls Defend Structure Bitcoin is currently facing a critical test, trading in a tight range after failing to break above its all-time high. Although bulls have managed to defend the overall structure and keep BTC above key moving averages, the price action has not provided a clear directional signal. The asset is roughly 6% down from its $112K peak, and while some traders expect an imminent breakout toward new highs, others warn of a potential retrace below the $100K psychological level. This divide among analysts stems from ongoing geopolitical instability — particularly in the Middle East — and tightening macroeconomic conditions. The Fed’s commitment to elevated interest rates and rising US Treasury yields continues to weigh on risk sentiment, making it difficult for BTC to build sustained momentum. Despite the uncertainty, buyers have shown signs of strength, with many looking to confirm the recent bounce as a solid bottom. Top analyst Maartunn highlighted one key bullish signal: heavy spikes in Taker Buy Volume, which indicate aggressive market orders being filled on the buy side. This suggests that high-conviction buyers are stepping in at current levels, potentially front-running a larger move to the upside. While this is a positive sign for short-term sentiment, Bitcoin must still reclaim the $109K–$112K range to invalidate the risk of a broader correction. Until then, traders remain cautious. If BTC closes a daily candle below the $103.6K support or loses the $100K level again, it could trigger a wave of liquidations and send prices lower. On the other hand, holding above $105K and building volume could set the stage for the next leg up. The coming days will be crucial in defining Bitcoin’s path forward. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move BTC Surges Above Key Support As Buyers Step In The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a strong bullish reaction after a brief dip below the $103,600 support level. The price rebounded sharply, reclaiming both the 100 and 50-period moving averages (green and blue lines, respectively), with BTC now trading around $105,357. This move confirms the importance of the $103,600 zone as a high-demand area, which has acted as a launchpad multiple times since early May. Volume surged on the recent bounce, indicating aggressive buying activity. The spike suggests whales and institutional buyers likely absorbed the panic selling triggered by geopolitical events earlier in the week. Price is now approaching the $109,300 resistance level, a key ceiling that capped multiple rallies in May and June. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 The short-term momentum remains constructive as long as BTC holds above the moving averages. However, a rejection near $109K could confirm a broader consolidation range between $103K and $109K. If bulls manage to flip $109,300 into support, the path to retest the all-time highs around $112K opens up.

2025-06-24T18:00:18,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Surging as Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors Move into Litecoin","As the 2025 crypto market enters a new phase, seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investors are increasingly turning their attention to both established altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and high-upside pre-sale opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This strategic capital rotation is fueling surging demand for early-stage tokens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the year’s most watched new entries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Pre-Sale of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become a magnet for traders seeking high-return potential, securing over $10 million and selling out each round with remarkable speed. Its capped token supply, verified HashEx audit, and transparent rollout have positioned it as a standout project among early-stage assets . Rather than relying on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on a structured, community-first approach. The combination of scarcity-based tokenomics, strong governance, and growing demand has led many to view it as one of the few altcoin projects with the infrastructure and investor backing to thrive in a post-cycle environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Rotation Fuels New Opportunities With Bitcoin crossing $111,000 and Ethereum holding between $2,800 and $3,000, both are widely seen as market leaders with more modest near-term upside. As institutional inflows stabilize and ETF-driven sentiment matures, some investors are now redirecting a portion of their capital toward alternative assets with asymmetric return profiles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a leading destination for those seeking that kind of opportunity, gaining traction among both early adopters and traditional holders. Litecoin: Reliable Performer with Fresh Momentum Often referred to as “digital silver,” Litecoin is reemerging in 2025 as a strong performer with renewed attention. As Litecoin benefits from reduced fees, strong transactional history, and ETF-related interest, it’s also clear that many traders are simultaneously turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its early-stage appeal. The dual interest highlights a broader trend: investors are looking for both reliability and upside potential in the same portfolio. Conclusion The reallocation of capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum into Litecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE marks a shift in how investors approach the 2025 market. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading in early-stage demand and Litecoin showing signs of resurgence, many are positioning themselves now in anticipation of the next altcoin rally.

Per data shared by on-chain and financial metrics platform Glassnode, Solana ( SOL ) CME Futures volume has hit 1.75 million contracts. The milestone, reached in the past 24 hours, coincided with a notable reversal for the SOL token. Its price bounced off lows of $125 in the wake of the Middle East conflict to hit highs of $146. At its current value, the altcoin is about 50% off its all-time high of $294 reached in January 2025.

But the benchmark digital asset has since bounced to above $105k, fueling gains across the crypto market . Solana’s gains have cut weekly losses for SOL price to under 1% as at the time of writing. CME Group announced the launch of SOL futures in March 2025, offering access to micro-sized contracts and larger-sized contracts. Market participants can choose between the 25 SOL micro-sized contract or the larger 500 SOL contract. “With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s global head of cryptocurrency products, said. After a slow start, with less than 400k in volume in April and May, the metric picked up and surpassed 1 million contracts this week. Analysts have opined that notable CME futures volume could be a signal for demand for Solana exchange-traded funds. Recently, experts gave SOL spot ETFs a 95% chance of approval in 2025. Coinglass data shows open interest in Solana has increased to over $6 billion. Meanwhile, derivatives volume has increased by more than 28% to $19.2 billion.

According to a June 24 press release , Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC, LLC purchased 3,724 Bitcoins (BTC) at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per BTC on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after announcing its $1 billion SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The aggressive initial purchase, worth roughly $387 million, was funded directly from a $750 million capital raise disclosed as part of the SPAC deal. The newly created company plans to hold the full amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and is expected to continue accumulating after it transitions into ProCap Financial, Inc., a publicly traded entity focused on institutional-grade Bitcoin services. You might also like: Chainlink and Mastercard partner to enable onchain crypto purchases Anthony Pompliano’s billion-dollar bet on the new institutional standard For Pompliano and his team, the decision to buy and hold $387 million worth of Bitcoin as part of a long-term accumulation strategy is less about optics and more about conviction. In public remarks and SEC filings, ProCap has made it clear that it views BTC not just as an asset, but as a benchmark. “Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate,” the company stated—underscoring its belief that the cryptocurrency is no longer speculative, but rather the minimum acceptable performance standard for capital deployment. By frontloading its BTC treasury with millions worth of the original cryptocurrency instead of holding idle dollars post-raise, ProCap is signaling a departure from traditional finance’s risk-averse playbook and leaning into Bitcoin as a base-layer financial asset. This isn’t just theory. Since 2020, public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets have outperformed their cash-heavy peers by staggering margins. Strategy, the most aggressive corporate adopter, saw its stock surge more than 3,000% at one point, not because of its core software business, but because of its Bitcoin treasury.

This news has caused the company’s value, once a small UK-based web design business, to jump from £3.7 million to over £1 billion. This dramatic rise followed its decision to buy large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a new business strategy. Smarter Web Makes A Big Move into Bitcoin Treasury On Tuesday, Smarter Web announced it bought 196.9 more BTC for £15.2 million, equivalent to $20.3 million. The company now owns 543.52 Bitcoins. They paid an average price of £77,988 for each coin, about $104,450. So far, Smarter Web has invested £42.4 million, or $56.8 million, in Bitcoin. At the same time, the company continues to provide web design, development, and online marketing services. It also earns money through setup fees, yearly hosting charges, and optional monthly plans. However, since April, the company, like many others, has also focused on building a Bitcoin treasury . In 2023, Smarter Web started accepting Bitcoin payments, believing it would be necessary for the future financial system. Confidence Fueled By Long-Term Gains with BTC The Smarter Web Company shared a 10-year growth plan to expand its customer base through web services and buy more Bitcoin when the time is right. The goal is to increase the company’s value and deliver long-term returns to shareholders. Since starting this plan, the company has become the UK’s largest Bitcoin holder. After a reverse takeover, it began trading on the Aquis Stock Exchange on April 25 with a value of about £3.7 million ($5 million). After announcing its Bitcoin strategy, its stock price soared nearly 20,000%, pushing its company value above £1 billion, equivalent to $1.4 billion. Even after a recent drop, Smarter Web remains the top company listed on Aquis. Smarter Web Backed By Bitcoin Heavyweights The Smarter Web Company is not making these moves alone. It is working with UTXO Management, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm led by David Bailey. David Bailey also runs Bitcoin Magazine and founded Nakamoto, a company that recently secured $51.5 million through a private deal. Bailey and UTXO’s Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, are on the company’s board. UTXO also invested in Smarter Web before it went public and is involved in other Bitcoin firms like Metaplanet and The Blockchain Group. While Smarter Web believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is unconvinced. The agency has warned that this kind of investment is high risk due to Bitcoin’s price swings. Coinbase’s David Duong also warned that companies using borrowed money to buy crypto could pose financial risks. However, he noted that the danger is still relatively limited.

2025-06-24T17:15:02,"Something Funky Has Been Happening to the Bitcoin Markets Since 2021: Details","The number of Bitcoin (BTC) deposit addresses on exchanges has dropped sharply. Such a pattern points to a deepening long-term conviction among investors. Data reveals a dramatic reversal in behavior that began after the 2021 cycle peak. Between 2015 and 2021, the number of unique addresses depositing BTC to exchanges steadily increased, averaging 180,000 annually. However, since 2022, that trend has not only stalled, but it has declined consistently. BTC Exchange Deposit Trend Reverses According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the 10-year average now stands at approximately 90,000, while the current 30-day moving average is just 48,000. On a daily basis, the number of depositing addresses has dropped to around 37,000, recording a multi-year low. Analysts say that this indicates a growing preference for holding Bitcoin rather than trading it. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has played a key role, which gave institutional and retail investors access to BTC’s price performance without needing to move or manage the asset directly. Additionally, lower retail trading activity in the current cycle has reduced active deposit behavior. At the same time, an increasing number of investors, and even corporations , are adopting a savings-oriented approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative instrument. The report said, “These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value.” This sentiment in investor behavior is echoed on a macro scale. Bitcoin As Modern Reserve Asset Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic asset for nations seeking to strengthen economic resilience in the current global landscape, according to a recent report by CoinShares. The cryptocurrency’s potential to hedge inflation, diversify sovereign portfolios, and offer protection against geopolitical instability positions it as a modern complement to gold and foreign exchange reserves. While the US decision in 2025 to add Bitcoin to its reserves is a crucial moment, CoinShares noted that the ongoing skepticism among economists who highlight its volatility and speculative nature. Despite this, with rising global debt, inflation, and mounting geopolitical tensions, more governments are exploring alternatives. Brazil’s RESBit proposal and Russia’s reported interest in Bitcoin reserves suggest a competitive push to secure a share of the asset’s fixed supply. With a $2 trillion market cap and growing institutional presence, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible reserve option alongside traditional holdings.

2025-06-24T17:11:31,"Israel-Iran Ceasefire Breakthrough Sends Crypto Markets Upwards; Bitcoin Bursts Back Above $106K","The crypto market rebounded during early Asian trading hours Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire between Iran and Israel had come into effect, triggering a sharp comeback across Bitcoin and major altcoins. The move seems to have largely erased recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment. Markets Gain As Tensions Ease Relief from the Middle East conflict in the form of a surprise ceasefire spurred a crypto and risk-asset rally. President Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump wrote. Crypto markets have turned nicely higher, with Bitcoin (BTC) now up by 5.1% over the past 24 hours to $106,017 after the brutal Sunday-Monday crash. The premier crypto had plummeted below the psychologically important $100,000 level on Sunday before staging its recovery. Bitcoin has historically trended positively during times of global unrest. During major events like the US–Iran conflict in 2020, Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022, and now the Iran–Israel war of 2025, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price stability. While it does not act like a traditional safe haven, it usually behaves like an uncorrelated hedge in systemic uncertainty. Ether (ETH), the industry’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is ahead 10.6% to trade back above $2,455. Ripple-promoted cryptocurrency XRP surged 11.2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto’s double-digit spike comes after Arthur Britto, co-founder of Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), posted on X for the first time in nearly 14 years. According to market data, Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and Dogecoin (DOGE) also rose between 9.6%-10% following the news of a possible ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/israel-iran-ceasefire-breakthrough-sends-crypto-markets-upwards-bitcoin-bursts-back-above-106k/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T17:06:37,"Why is crypto up today? Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins see big gains","The overall crypto market cap rose 2.3% as traders hoped for de-escalation in the Middle East. Crypto markets saw notable gains on Tuesday, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the rally. On Tuesday, June 24, Bitcoin climbed 5.3%, rising back above $105,000. Altcoins performed even better, posting double-digit gains, with the total crypto market cap up 5.19%. Ethereum (ETH) was among the strongest performers, up 11.33%. Altcoins also saw big gains, with XRP (XRP) up 10.15%, Solana (SOL) rising 9.61%, and Cardano (ADA) up 9.4%. Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also saw strong growth, nearing double digits. The most likely catalyst for this rally was growing optimism that tensions in the Middle East are easing. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel be stricly respected on both sides. You might also like: Stablecoins and oil are Trump’s macro weapons, says DeVere CEO The ceasefire came after U.S. bombers targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, prompting a symbolic response from Iran via strikes on U.S. bases in Qatar. Iran reportedly gave ample warning, allowing U.S. personnel to evacuate and avoid escalation. This development brought relief to traders, as a prolonged war, especially one involving the U.S., threatened to destabilize the global economy. In particular, heightened tensions had driven up oil prices, stoking fears of rising global inflation. In particular, at one point, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of global oil production flows every day. In this environment, central banks are forced to raise interest rates, which hurts risk assets like crypto. You might also like: Oil, inflation, and Bitcoin are now locked in the same trade Where will Bitcoin and Ethereum go next? The ceasefire between Iran and Israel is fragile, as seen by Israeli strikes on Iran soon after Trump announced the deal. Still, an irate response from Trump seems to have caused Israel to back down. In any case, the risk of further escalation is lower now than it was two weeks ago. Traders, both retail and institutional, will now likely take a more risk-on approach. Future catalysts for growth include the GENIUS Act , which will bring the first regulatory framework for stablecoins to the U.S. Institutions will also likely continue to buy up Bitcoin for their treasuries.
