2025-06-24T10:46:08,"Words of Praise for This Altcoin from the Company That Made the First Big Step in the US! ""Wall Street Can't See the Truth, It Could Even Overtake Bitcoin!""","Ripple (XRP) became one of the altcoins that gained the most momentum after Donald Trump's presidential victory in November 2024, making a name for itself with a massive rally extending above $3. XRP, which has generally maintained its $2 level since then, continues to see strong demand. While major companies announced major moves to create XRP Treasuries after Bitcoin and Ethereum, Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie spoke highly of XRP. In a recent interview, Sal Gilbertie said that XRP shows strong demand and long-term bullish potential. Stating that there has been tremendous interest in XRP recently, the famous CEO drew attention to the increasing demand for XRP-related investment products. “We have known for many years that there has been pent-up demand for XRP. Will there be more upside potential than Bitcoin? Many say yes… I think XRP has very good upside potential.” Sal Gilbertie also stated that Wall Street is ignoring the true power of the XRP community. According to the CEO, Ripple plays a significant role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and its influence is being underestimated. At this point, Gilbertie added that he sees XRP as the most useful crypto. Finally, comparing XRP to other major cryptocurrencies, Gilbertie described Bitcoin as a digital store of value, as digital gold. Regarding Ethereum, Gilbertie admitted that he does not have a deep understanding of the ETH ecosystem and did not give a clear assessment of ETH. However, Teucrium CEO stated that XRP is developing and argued that there is much more growth potential. Although he did not give an exact price target, he predicted that the XRP price would rise to much higher levels. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T10:40:44,"Trump Media Keeps Bitcoin Plan Despite $400M Buyback Move","Despite initial denials, the company confirmed it raised $2.5 billion for Bitcoin purchases via share resales and convertible notes, supported by a registration approved by SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Meanwhile, President Trump’s broader crypto agenda is under scrutiny. Lawmakers introduced the COIN Act to restrict political figures from crypto involvement, due to ethical concerns. Separately, Panther Metals Plc surged 21% after announcing it would integrate Bitcoin into its own treasury and use it as collateral for mining acquisitions. Stock Buyback Won’t Stop Trump’s Bitcoin Plans Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind the Truth Social platform, announced a $400-million stock buyback program, and explained that the move will not interfere with its previously disclosed plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. In a notice that was released Monday, the company stated that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million in common shares, and clarified that this initiative is separate from its cryptocurrency ambitions, which include investing more than $2 billion into Bitcoin. Announcement from TMTG After initially denying reports that it planned to raise $3 billion for cryptocurrency investments, Trump Media later confirmed that it secured $2.5 billion in funding for Bitcoin purchases. According to the filing, the company’s Bitcoin strategy includes a private placement offering amounting to roughly $2.3 billion. These funds were generated through the resale of 56 million shares and 29 million shares linked to convertible notes, based on debt and equity agreements previously registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC, which is now chaired by Paul Atkins, approved the registration statement tied to Trump Media’s Bitcoin initiative earlier this year. The company also submitted applications to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF and, through Truth Social, a dual ETF tied to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These applications came after the SEC began approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January of 2024 and spot Ether ETFs in May of 2024. Beyond corporate investments, President Trump proposed the creation of a national “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a broader “Digital Asset Stockpile” via a March executive order. These reserves will hold digital assets seized or forfeited to the US government. However, Trump advisers have hinted at broader ambitions for accumulating digital assets beyond legal forfeitures. Critics, including lawmakers on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, accused the president of leveraging his office to financially benefit crypto-aligned entities. Bill Targets Trump’s Crypto Ties The disapproval of Trump’s crypto ties is only increasing. California Senator Adam Schiff and nine other Democratic lawmakers recently introduced the COIN Act . This is a bill that is specifically aimed at preventing what they describe as the financial exploitation of digital assets by the US president and other public officials. Announcement from Sen. Adam Schiff The legislation comes in response to the growing concerns over President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly after the disclosure that he earned $57.4 million through World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform backed by members of his family. According to Schiff , Trump’s involvement with digital assets raised “significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns” regarding the use of presidential power for personal financial gain. The COIN Act proposes to bar current and former public officials—including presidents and their families—from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of digital asset like cryptocurrencies, meme coins, NFTs, or stablecoins. These restrictions would apply for a period extending from 180 days before taking office to two years after leaving office. The bill specifically targets payment stablecoins, after WLF’s announcement of its USD1 stablecoin in March. An Abu Dhabi-based company reportedly planned to use the stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment on Binance. Additionally, the Trump family’s ownership stake in WLF reduced from 75% in December to 40% in June, with the divestment potentially netting millions in proceeds. An April report from the State Democracy Defenders Action revealed that Trump’s digital asset holdings were worth approximately $2.9 billion, and consists of about 40% of his total net worth. The bill by Schiff is one of the Senate’s earliest attempts to directly confront the president’s crypto-related financial interests. On the same day, California Representative Maxine Waters introduced a parallel bill in the House called the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act. The measure was introduced shortly after Trump held a private dinner to honor top holders of his personal meme coin. Despite their high-profile nature, the future of either bill is still very uncertain. With Democrats in the minority in both chambers of Congress, the legislation faces an uphill battle. Even if it passes the House and Senate, it would likely be vetoed by President Trump. Panther Metals Rides Bitcoin Treasury Wave Trump and TMTG are not alone in their Bitcoin ambitions. Panther Metals Plc, a UK-listed mineral exploration company, also recently unveiled a strategic shift by integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, combining traditional mining operations with digital asset holdings. On Monday, the company announced plans to acquire £4 million ($5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin to position the asset not just as a store of value but as a form of productive capital. As part of this strategy, Panther will use £1.3 million ($1.75 million) in Bitcoin from its treasury as collateral to complete the acquisition of the Pick Lake mining deposit in Ontario, Canada, while maintaining full Bitcoin exposure. Announcement highlights from Panther Metals This move is a departure from the standard Bitcoin treasury model, where companies passively hold the asset. Panther plans to actively leverage Bitcoin to finance high-quality mineral projects, minimizing shareholder dilution by tapping into more favorable terms available in the digital asset market. CEO Darren Hazelwood believes in Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency volatility, and stated that the hybrid strategy enhances the company’s resilience and market adaptability. The Pick Lake asset is part of the larger Winston Project, a high-grade, polymetallic zinc, copper, and precious metals deposit. It represents approximately 85% of the project's total mineral resources. Zinc is a key component in galvanizing steel and battery technologies, and is considered a critical mineral, adding even more strategic value to the acquisition. Hazelwood claims the model equips Panther to thrive across varying market cycles. Investor enthusiasm was evident, as shares of Panther Metals (PALM) surged 21% on the London Stock Exchange on Monday. Over the past month, PALM stock climbed 150%, including a 61% rise in just the last week, according to Google Finance. Panther Metals share price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) Panther now joins a growing list of corporations adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Real estate magnate Grant Cardone recently revealed his firm’s first Bitcoin purchase after acquiring 1,000 BTC for its corporate treasury.

According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) experienced a price surge following news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran . The largest cryptocurrency by market cap almost touched the $106,000 threshold, reaching as high as $105,927 in the past 24 hours. At press time, BTC has gone up 3.9% and is currently trading hands at a price of $105,302. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin has suffered through the geopolitical events that have broken through between Israel, Iran and the United States . Within the past few days, BTC fell into a slump following news of the U.S. bombing three of Iran’s nuclear bases. On June 22, BTC experienced a sharp decline, dropping well beyond it previous peak of $106,003 just two days prior. On June 23, Bitcoin reached its lowest point since May, dropping to $98,974.

The past month has seen the cryptocurrency fall by nearly 2%. Not only that, Bitcoin’s market cap also enjoyed a 3.24% boost, climbing up to $2.09 trillion following the recent price surge. Additionally, BTC’s trading volume also saw a 6.9% increase compared to the previous day, amounting to $52.8 billion based on current market prices. Even the wider crypto market cap has experienced a 2.1% surge after news of the ceasefire broke, amounting to $3.36 trillion. A ceasefire signal between Israel and Iran may have eased investor concerns for now. Crypto markets often recover quickly when geopolitical fears recede. However, traders still have their eyes on the continuing conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite the agreed upon deal between the two countries, brokered by Donald Trump and Qatar, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Iran of violating the ceasefire only two hours after the deal was announced. According to the BBC, despite Iran furiously denying the accusation, Israel plans to “respond forcefully to Iran’s violation of the ceasefire with intense strikes” targeting the nation’s capital in Iran. It remains to be seen whether Israel will follow through with the threat, and how it will affect Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

2025-06-24T10:38:29,"Why is the crypto market going up today?","Crypto market recovered as Bitcoin reclaimed the $100k level, following reports of a potential truce between Israel and Iran that may bring an end to the recent ongoing hostilities between the two nations. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that both nations have agreed to a full truce, which he said will bring an end to what he called “The 12 Day War.” The announcement helped calm investor fears and gave markets a reason to rally after a volatile weekend. According to crypto.news, the global crypto market cap rose 2.8% to hit $3.39 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon in Asia. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged 3.4% to cross $105k, while Ethereum ( ETH ) spiked 6.7% to reclaim the $2,400 level. Major altcoins followed the trend, with XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) climbing 8.5%, 8.2%, and 7%, respectively. The rebound follows a steep weekend sell-off triggered by heightened conflict, after Israel intensified its airstrikes and the U.S. reportedly launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities. BTC had dropped nearly 4% to $98,615, while ETH and SOL saw declines of up to 10% amid investor concerns over an extended conflict and its potential economic fallout. Now, with geopolitical risks easing, market sentiment has improved sharply. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 47 points to hit 65, back into “Greed” territory. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows the average RSI across the market rose to a neutral 58. Open interest also climbed by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped 28% to $482 million per CoinGlass data . Interestingly, most of the liquidations came from shorts, indicating a possible short squeeze that may have helped fuel the rally even more. You might also like: Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire Increased institutional participation further underpinned the market rebound. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $350.4 million in inflows on Monday, a sharp rise from just $6.37 million on Friday. Ethereum ETFs also saw strong inflows of $100.7 million, reversing from previous day outflows of $11.3 million. Adding to the bullish momentum, Strategy’s Michael Saylor revealed the company had bought another $26 million worth of Bitcoin. Strategy’s latest purchase came amid a broader 2025 trend, with more public companies following its lead and adopting Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset. For instance, Japan’s Metaplanet recently executed a $108 million purchase , while entrepreneur and investor Anthony Pompliano announced the launch of a Bitcoin treasury firm backed by prominent institutions such as Citadel and Jane Street, with the goal of building a $1 billion Bitcoin reserve. On the regulatory front, the Federal Reserve’s decision on June 23 to remove the term “reputational risk” from its bank supervision guidelines was seen as a key catalyst. The change eliminates a subjective barrier that had deterred banks from engaging with crypto firms. Industry observers believe this move could normalize banking access for digital asset companies and accelerate crypto-financial integration.

2025-06-24T10:35:11,"Ripple’s Arthur Britto resurfaces on X after 14-year silence","A mysterious Ripple co-founder and co-developer of XRP Ledger has resurfaced on X after 14 years of silence, sparking speculation that his reappearance means big things are ahead for XRP. Arthur Britto, a mysterious co-creator of the XRP Ledger alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb and also a co-founder of Ripple, posted on X today for the first time in 14 years. 😶 — Arthur Britto (@ahbritto) June 23, 2025 Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed that the post, which contained a single emoji, was legitimate and not the result of any hack or unauthorized access. The development sparked excitement in the XRP community, as Britto has kept an extremely low profile despite his key role in the project. He has never given interviews, appeared in photos, or taken part in public discussions. The secrecy surrounding Britto has even fueled speculation about whether he’s a real person. However, this seems unlikely as Ripple CTO David Schwartz has publicly referenced Britto before. In a 2021 thread on X, Schwartz confirmed Britto is a “separate and distinct human being” who is simply “intensely private.” In that thread, Schwartz also mentioned that Britto was entitled to 2% of assets created with the Stellar ledger, referencing an agreement that Jed McCaleb allegedly violated. Source: @JoelKatz You might also like: CZ speculates Satoshi Nakamoto is an AI from the future Britto has also been tied to the bold claim that “XRP was designed to reach $10,000,” a statement that gained traction from a 2019 YouTube video claiming he made the prediction in 2017. However, there’s no confirmed source linking the quote directly to him. What is confirmed is Britto’s original focus on utility over hype. In a 2013 internal memo, Britto wrote: “The value of XRP is probably less important than the spread. I expect most people and institutions using the ledger to ignore XRP altogether.” Some users believe Britto’s sudden reappearance could signal major developments ahead for XRP. “The network is waking up. And Britto doesn’t post for nothing,” wrote John Squire, highlighting the coincidence that Britto’s return came as XRP hit 1.5 million transactions in 24 hours, the highest volume in four months. So why does his return matter? Because this week, $XRP just hit 1.5 million transactions in 24 hours — the highest in 4 months. The network is waking up.

2025-06-24T10:30:53,"Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern—Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead","Bitcoin rallied above $105,000 in mid-morning European trading on Tuesday, clawing back losses sustained over the weekend after dipping below six figures for the first time since May. Yet the respite may prove fleeting, says veteran technician Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend). Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2021 On side-by-side charts of the current cycle and the 2021-to-2024 arc, the analyst argued that Bitcoin is “the same exact pattern—run-up, one high, back down, second high,” followed by an ABC corrective sequence that in 2021 bottomed only after a second, deeper flush. “Gut says no,” he told viewers when asked whether last Friday’s sell-off had already marked capitulation. “We’ve been talking about this ABC since March… people were calling for new lows; I said nope, we got five waves at the top, we got an ABC and then we go— and that’s when the alts take off.” His base case now envisions a relief rally toward the $107,000–$108,000 band—the level where a trend-line projected from the two post-halving peaks intersects—before a final leg lower drives price into what he calls the “pain box” sandwiched between the 0.702 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracements of the entire rally from last October’s $58,000 breakout. In 2021 that zone ultimately wicked to the exact 0.618, a move he believes could repeat, implying spot levels between roughly $96,500 and $92,000. “This measurement fits the parameter now… if it wants to turn around and rip, great,” he conceded, “but there’s still a very good chance that was not the end.” Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss Internally, the analyst parses the current drop as the developing C-wave of a larger flat, subdividing into a classic five-wave impulse. Wave three, he notes, appears complete; wave four “could come up high,” granting altcoins a short-lived pop, “but hopefully, again, sooner than later, we roll over.” He cites 2021’s July fractal, when Bitcoin bounced 20% before sliding a final time, as a psychological template. “When there’s a big news narrative event,” he observed, “we’ll get a little relief—people think it’s done—then wham, one more thing to scare retail.” Macro sentiment, he argues, remains fragile. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange gap at $92,000 is drawing “average-retail” bids, a setup he characterises as a “washing machine” in which professional money fronts liquidity only to fade it. “Retail is just a washing machine, man… that buy isn’t going to get filled,” he warned. Still, he reiterated long-term optimism, revealing he “hammered some buys” during Monday’s dip and advising his followers to dollar-cost average—“not financial advice”—through the turbulence. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Quantum Ascend’s upside target for the ensuing impulsive advance is comparatively restrained: $132,000, a level he says enjoys “two pieces of confluence” and would coincide with “the alts moment” when Bitcoin dominance finally cracks. “We will eventually work our way back up near the top of this B-wave… flag a little, and then boom,” he predicted, referencing November 2021’s so-called “Trump pump” that ignited a multisector altcoin surge. For now, traders watch the 0.702–0.618 pocket and the mooted relief ceiling at $108,000. Should Bitcoin slice through support without that interim bounce, the analyst says, the flush could conclude “sooner than later,” clearing the runway for what he calls “the next few months—our moment.” In his sign-off he urged viewers to “be an adult, live through it,” but also confessed palpable excitement: “I feel really good about where we’re at.” Whether the market shares his confidence will likely become clear once the final C-wave verdict arrives—perhaps, he hopes, within the week. At press time, BTC traded at $105,077.

2025-06-24T10:19:16,"Fed Cracks Down: U.S. Banks Can No Longer Block Crypto Over “Reputational Risk”—Now What?","The United States Federal Reserve has removed “reputational risk” from its supervisory framework for banks, a decision that could reshape how financial institutions engage with the crypto sector. In a policy update released Monday, the Fed said it will now focus on more specific financial risk discussions instead of the vague and often criticized reputational risk metric. For years, crypto firms have argued that reputational risk has been used as a vague and unfair justification to block or sever banking relationships with crypto firms, contributing to what many referred to as “debanking.” @federalreserve announces that reputational risk will no longer be a component of examination programs in its supervision of banks: https://t.co/7Gwn1UuyNx — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) June 23, 2025 With the change, banks may now find it easier to do business with digital asset companies without fear of supervisory pushback. Fed Clarifies Banks Risk Ratings, Dropping Barrier Long Blamed for Crypto Exclusion The policy shift may ease access to financial services for companies operating in the digital asset space, many of which have faced challenges in maintaining banking ties over the past several years. “This is a win, but there is still more work to be done,” said U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis in response to the announcement. Lummis, a pro-crypto lawmaker from Wyoming, has been vocal about the need for regulatory clarity in the crypto space and has criticized what she called the “assassination” of digital asset businesses in the U.S. through aggressive regulatory practices. In February, I exposed the Fed’s aggressive reputation risk policies that assassinated American bitcoin & digital asset businesses. Today, the Fed announced it will scrap reputation risk as a factor in its bank supervision. This is a win, but there is still more work to be done. https://t.co/AOZSr0IFcp pic.twitter.com/1FtsIcNJsI — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 23, 2025 According to the Federal Reserve, the removal of reputational risk is meant to clarify how examiners evaluate a bank’s risk management practices. The updated guidance emphasizes that the formal rating will now reflect both quantitative and qualitative elements tied directly to financial performance and safety. “This change does not alter the Board’s expectation that banks maintain strong risk management,” the Fed said, adding that the adjustment is not meant to prevent banks from using the concept of reputational risk in their own internal assessments. Historically, reputational risk was defined by the Fed as the possibility that negative publicity, true or not, could lead to customer losses, litigation, or a drop in revenue. Critics in the crypto industry have long argued that the term was too broad and too subjective, allowing regulators to apply inconsistent standards, especially when it came to digital assets. Fed Ends ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ Tactics with Reputational Risk Reform The decision comes after years of what some have described as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ,” a period during which more than 30 crypto and fintech firms reported being cut off from banking services. Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, welcomed the change. “The supervisory process will now be more transparent and consistent,” he said. “We have long believed banks should be able to make business decisions based on prudent risk management and the free market, not the individual perspectives of regulators,” he added. The Fed has already begun reviewing and removing references to reputational risk from its guidance materials. It is also planning to train examiners on the new framework and coordinate with other federal banking regulators to ensure consistent application. The removal of reputational risk references will be done gradually as existing guidance is updated. Although banks are still required to manage risks in line with existing regulations, the shift could provide relief for crypto firms seeking stable banking relationships in the U.S. It also follows a broader trend of regulatory recalibration, as several federal agencies appear to be easing crypto-related restrictions introduced in previous years . The crypto industry scored several wins in recent months as federal regulators eased long-standing banking barriers. The FDIC removed “reputational risk” from its bank oversight criteria , following the Senate Banking Committee’s approval of the FIRM Act. In May, the OCC confirmed banks can handle crypto trading and delegate services. The FDIC also greenlit crypto activities without prior approval. On June 17, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoin regulation, with strong bipartisan support. The bill now heads to the House, potentially cementing the first comprehensive US crypto framework. Still, some observers warn the change could reduce oversight and open the door to riskier bank behavior if not properly monitored. But for the digital asset industry, the removal of reputational risk marks a moment of progress after years of regulatory uncertainty.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price has been down more than 75% since December 2024, and Q1 2025 played a significant role in pushing it deep down the well. However, in April of Q2 2025, bullish forces revived and took it to the 0.236 level-based resistance in mid-May. Despite the efforts, the Polygon was still very low and was among the list of altcoins that showed muted growth in Q2 compared to other altcoins. However, the muted growth was brief as mid-May to June bears pushed its price back to April’s low, which shows that the asset strongly lacks bullish conviction in the short term. The POL price could pull below $0.1000 if bearish forces continue downward pressure. All these circumstances occurred during Donald Trump’s presidential start in 2025, and by H1 so far, the market participants have witnessed multiple wars, resulting in bearish dominance. The recent Israel-Iran agreement was the most significant factor that pushed altcoins like POL’s price in June. However, on June 24th, POL saw a 7% intraday rise with a ceasefire announcement, which reignited people’s expectations. Therefore, if the conditions improve, the 0.236 Fibonacci level could be retested in June or July. If it clears that $0.4572 level in June or July, the odds of clearing Fibo are 0.50, 0.786, and the 1.0 level could be retested by the end of 2025. Additionally, RSI has reached oversold territory, and with the recent intraday rise, RSI has reversed, too. It shows that the Bullish sentiment is increasing in the short term.

The move comes as the firm advances a bold cryptocurrency investment strategy, despite rising scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. According to a company notice, the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $400 million in common stock. However, the company clarified that the share buyback initiative is separate from its cryptocurrency plans, which involve a $2.3 billion private placement aimed at building a Bitcoin reserve. Trump Media had previously denied reports of a $3 billion fundraising effort for digital assets but later confirmed it had secured $2.5 billion for that purpose. SEC Greenlights Trump Media’s Bitcoin Investment The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, approved the registration statement related to the Bitcoin funding plan in June. Documents show that Trump Media raised the capital through the resale of 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares linked to convertible notes under debt and equity agreements. In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Trump Media has applied to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF . A separate filing by Truth Social seeks approval to list a dual ETF tied to both Bitcoin and Ether. The SEC has been greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs since January 2024 and Ether ETFs since May, indicating a shifting regulatory environment toward mainstream crypto investment products. Trump’s broader crypto ambitions also include the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile —proposed in a March executive order. These reserves would contain digital assets forfeited to the government, though advisers have hinted at additional ways to expand the holdings. Political Scrutiny Intensifies Over Digital Asset Plans Despite Trump Media’s reassurances, political backlash is growing. Lawmakers from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations have accused President Trump of using his office to benefit crypto firms through initiatives like the Strategic Reserve. Coinciding with the announcement, Senator Adam Schiff introduced the COIN Act, which seeks to bar presidents and other public officials from issuing or endorsing digital assets . If passed, the legislation could place Trump Media’s Bitcoin strategy in legal jeopardy.

2025-06-24T10:10:17,"Crucial Iran Israel Ceasefire: What It Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Crucial Iran Israel Ceasefire: What It Means for the Crypto Market In a significant development echoing across global headlines, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) has confirmed that the Iran Israel ceasefire has officially entered its implementation stage. This crucial announcement, reported by Jin10.com and citing Chinese media CCTV, marks a potentially pivotal moment for the Middle East and, by extension, the intricate web of global financial markets, including the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency space. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding the ripple effects of such geopolitical shifts is paramount. Understanding the Iran Israel Ceasefire: A Glimmer of Hope? The news of an operational ceasefire between Iran and Israel is a development that demands attention. While specific details of the agreement remain under wraps, the mere confirmation of its implementation phase suggests a de-escalation of tensions that have long simmered in one of the world’s most sensitive regions. This move could signal a cautious step towards a more stable environment, potentially easing concerns that have weighed on international relations and economic forecasts. Historically, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been characterized by deep-seated animosity and proxy conflicts, contributing to regional instability. Any formal or informal agreement to cease hostilities, even temporarily, can have far-reaching consequences. It’s not just about the immediate cessation of conflict; it’s about the potential for reduced uncertainty, which is a commodity highly valued in financial markets. Why Geopolitical Stability Matters for the Global Economy The interconnectedness of the modern world means that events in one region can send shockwaves across continents. Geopolitical stability is a cornerstone of a thriving global economy . When major powers or key regions are embroiled in conflict, several economic consequences typically unfold: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can impede trade routes, disrupt energy supplies, and affect the movement of goods and services, leading to inflation and shortages. Investor Uncertainty: Heightened tensions cause investors to become risk-averse, pulling capital from speculative or volatile assets and seeking safer havens. Commodity Price Volatility: Prices of essential commodities like oil and gas are particularly sensitive to geopolitical events, as production and transit routes can be threatened. Reduced Consumer Confidence: Economic uncertainty can lead consumers to reduce spending, further dampening economic growth. Conversely, signs of de-escalation or peace often lead to renewed optimism, encouraging investment and fostering economic growth. A ceasefire, even if fragile, can inject a dose of confidence into markets that have been bracing for worse outcomes. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: Opportunities and Risks So, how does this Iran Israel ceasefire news specifically relate to the cryptocurrency market? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to global macro events. In fact, it often reacts with amplified volatility due to its relatively smaller market capitalization compared to traditional assets. Here’s how geopolitical shifts can influence digital assets: Flight to Safe-Haven Assets: During times of extreme uncertainty, investors often seek safe-haven assets . Traditionally, this has been gold, the U.S. dollar, or government bonds. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has increasingly been considered a safe haven by some, particularly during periods of fiat currency instability or regional conflict. A de-escalation could see some of this ‘safe-haven’ demand for Bitcoin wane, as investors might rotate back into riskier, higher-yield assets. Risk-On Sentiment: If the ceasefire holds and fosters greater global stability, it could encourage a ‘risk-on’ sentiment. This means investors might be more willing to allocate capital to growth-oriented and higher-risk assets, which includes cryptocurrencies. Increased investor confidence could lead to broader capital inflows into the crypto ecosystem, potentially boosting prices across the board. Market Volatility: While a ceasefire generally implies positive sentiment, initial reactions can still be volatile as markets digest the news and assess its long-term implications. Traders might take profits on assets that rallied during the period of heightened tension, or new capital might flow in, causing price swings. Altcoin Performance: Bitcoin often leads the market, but altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to perform well during periods of broader market optimism. If the ceasefire contributes to sustained positive sentiment, we could see altcoins experiencing significant gains as investor appetite for riskier, higher-reward assets increases. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and broader economic indicators all play significant roles. What are the Challenges and Lingering Questions? While the news of a ceasefire is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to approach it with cautious optimism. Several challenges and questions remain: Fragility of the Ceasefire: Is this a temporary truce or a step towards a more enduring peace? The long history of tensions suggests that any agreement could be fragile and subject to immediate reversal if underlying issues are not addressed. Underlying Issues: A ceasefire addresses immediate hostilities but doesn’t necessarily resolve the fundamental disagreements and power dynamics that fuel the conflict. Broader Regional Dynamics: The Middle East is a complex region with numerous interconnected conflicts and alliances. This ceasefire, while significant, might not immediately resolve other regional flashpoints. Global Economic Headwinds: Even with improved geopolitical stability, the global economy still faces challenges such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and potential recessions in major economies. These factors will continue to influence market performance, including crypto. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst Evolving Geopolitics Given the potential for both positive and negative market reactions to geopolitical news, here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, particularly those involving major global powers or regions with significant economic implications. News sources like IRNA, Jin10.com, and CCTV can provide direct updates, but always cross-reference. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of different cryptocurrencies and potentially traditional assets, can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Practice Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Geopolitical events can trigger rapid price movements, making robust risk management essential. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. While short-term volatility due to geopolitical news can be unsettling, focusing on the long-term potential of the technology and its adoption can help weather temporary storms. Assess Bitcoin’s Role: Continue to observe Bitcoin’s performance during periods of geopolitical stress. Its increasing acceptance as a potential safe-haven asset could further solidify its position in global finance. A Path Towards Stability? The confirmation of an Iran Israel ceasefire entering its implementation phase is a development that brings a cautious sense of relief. While the road ahead remains uncertain and filled with complexities, any step towards de-escalation in a region as pivotal as the Middle East is a positive sign for geopolitical stability and, by extension, the global economy . For the crypto community, this news underscores the profound interconnectedness of world events and the digital asset space. Investors should remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate the evolving landscape, always mindful of both the opportunities and the inherent risks that come with a world in flux.

2025-06-24T10:10:00,"Cardano Price Prediction Experts Now Eyeing Bitcoin Solaris as the Faster, More Profitable Bitcoin Alternative","Cardano has built its reputation on research-driven development and a loyal community. But recently, even some of its strongest advocates have started looking elsewhere. With ADA price predictions pointing to sluggish or even negative short-term movement, investors are exploring faster and more lucrative options. One name keeps rising through the noise: Bitcoin Solaris. A new wave of analysts and early adopters believe Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) offers what Cardano currently cannot. It is not just about speed. It is about accessibility, real utility, and a presale that is catching fire. The shift is not random. It is driven by real numbers and revolutionary design. ADA Holds Its Ground, But It Is No Longer Enough Cardano is still a respected force in the layer-one race. Its staking ecosystem and development roadmap are well structured. However, the excitement around it has dulled. ADA’s current price trends are uninspiring, and predictions are showing a possible decline. This has raised concern among retail traders who are searching for quicker wins or better fundamentals. The current stagnation is not a flaw in Cardano’s vision. It is simply a signal that market sentiment is shifting toward projects that can offer both high performance and immediate potential. Bitcoin Solaris Captures the Moment Bitcoin Solaris is doing what most coins promise but fail to deliver. It is faster, lighter, and truly decentralized. More importantly, it is structured to make wealth-building not only possible but accessible. Unlike traditional mining projects, Bitcoin Solaris puts power into your hands, literally. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, anyone with a smartphone or basic device will be able to mine BTC-S without owning a mining rig. That alone redefines who gets to participate in crypto wealth generation. But accessibility is only part of the story. Bitcoin Solaris is built on solid performance benchmarks. A dual-layer blockchain structure separates the base Proof-of-Work layer from the fast Solaris Layer. Transaction throughput reaches over 10,000 transactions per second. Finality is achieved in just 2 seconds, thanks to an optimized block rotation mechanism. Validator rotation occurs in real time to maximize decentralization and network stability. Smart contracts are fully integrated and support advanced logic for real-world applications. These are not promises. These are benchmarks already embedded in the project’s DNA. Early Bitcoin Changed Lives, BTC-S Is the Second Chance Tokenomics That Make Sense Where many projects inflate token supply or rely on hype cycles, Bitcoin Solaris keeps things focused and sustainable. The total supply of BTC-S is fixed at 21 million tokens. That number is not just symbolic. It is the foundation of a carefully balanced economy. 66.66 percent of the supply is allocated for mining over the next 90 years. 20 percent support the ongoing presale. 5 percent powers liquidity pools. Smaller percentages are reserved for ecosystem growth, marketing, and staking rewards. This structure ensures that control remains with the community, not just insiders. It encourages long-term value, not quick flips. You can read more in detail on the Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics Page . The Buzz Behind the Breakout Crypto influencers and analysts are starting to break down the project publicly. A detailed breakdown of Bitcoin Solaris’s mechanics and potential was recently published in a review by Crypto Vlog , which highlighted its layered structure and mobile-first vision. Enthusiasts are not just watching. They are participating. More than 11,500 early adopters have already secured tokens through the presale. Over 5 million dollars has been raised. And with less than six weeks left until launch, the clock is ticking on what could be the fastest-growing crypto event of 2025. Presale Momentum Is Unmatched We are now in phase 8 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale. The price per token is 8 dollars. In the next phase, it jumps to 9 dollars. The launch price is set at 20 dollars. That represents a potential 150 percent return in just a few weeks. Over 11,500 unique buyers have joined the movement. Momentum has not slowed even as the price continues to rise. This presale is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive in recent memory. The team is backed by audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , offering transparency and security to new investors.

Bitcoin Solaris is designed for utility, scalability, and reward. From mobile mining to lightning-fast transactions, it is redefining what it means to earn in Web3. Cardano will always have its place in the ecosystem, but if speed, profitability, and timing matter to you, then BTC-S may be the better answer for 2025. One link. One app. One opportunity to mine and earn from the palm of your hand. Start mining and explore what Bitcoin Solaris has already built before the rest of the market catches up.

2025-06-24T10:07:55,"Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2?","The post Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the Cardano token is $ 0.58209674 . Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

The fall continued in June, eroding nearly 38% of its gains to April’s low near $0.55 support level. The bleeding price has pierced its strong standing support zone in H1 2025, which aligns with the “FR volume profile level” at $0.60. This level was of utmost value, and losing this support makes the situation weaker for ADA. This all happened with geopolitical changes in June that pulled the ADA market to April’s low. However, ADA has seen renewed buying from this level back in April, and if it repeats the same this time, a rise above $0.60 could lead to a retest of the channels’ upper border again and break if firm bullish conviction joins in a future session. ADA must close above $0.74 to confirm a bullish breakout, which could open the path to retesting $1.10, as this was a significant resistance level since mid-December 2024. A breakdown here would be catastrophic, which could push the fall toward the lower border of the falling wedge. The support levels that could halt ADA from falling are $0.55 and $0.40. However, if selling fails to push the sustain above H1 support by clearing $0.60 in the short term and reverses, a fall could be severe. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) June 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-06-24T10:00:10,"Urgent: Donald Trump Pushes Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts Before Jerome Powell Testimony","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Donald Trump Pushes Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts Before Jerome Powell Testimony In the dynamic world of finance, where every whisper from a key figure can send ripples through global markets, a recent statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump has once again ignited a fiery debate. Ahead of what promises to be a pivotal Jerome Powell Testimony before Congress, Trump has voiced a remarkably strong opinion on the direction of U.S. monetary policy. His insistence on substantial Interest Rate Cuts isn’t just a political talking point; it’s a declaration that could significantly influence economic discourse and, by extension, the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macroeconomic currents is paramount, as central bank actions often dictate the broader liquidity and risk appetite that fuel digital asset markets. Donald Trump’s Bold Call for Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts On his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump reiterated his firm belief that the Federal Reserve needs to drastically lower interest rates. His specific suggestion of a two to three percentage point reduction is not a minor adjustment but a seismic shift from current levels. Trump argued that such a move could inject massive savings into the U.S. economy, potentially saving the nation an astounding $800 billion annually. His rationale is straightforward: lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing for the government, businesses, and consumers, theoretically stimulating economic activity. He also proposed a flexible approach, suggesting that rates could be increased again if future economic conditions warranted it. This perspective underscores a fundamental divergence from the traditional, independent stance of the Federal Reserve. The Stakes for Jerome Powell’s Testimony: Navigating Pressure The timing of Trump’s comments is crucial, coming just before Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled testimony before Congress on June 24. Powell’s appearances before legislative bodies are always closely watched, offering insights into the central bank’s thinking on inflation, employment, and future monetary policy. However, this testimony carries added weight due to the explicit political pressure from a former President who may yet return to office. The Federal Reserve prides itself on its independence from political influence, making decisions based purely on economic data and its dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. Will Powell address Trump’s comments directly? How will he balance the Fed’s independence with the political rhetoric? These are key questions that investors, economists, and even crypto traders will be asking. Key Considerations for Powell’s Testimony: Inflation Data: Recent inflation figures will heavily influence the Fed’s stance. Employment Trends: The strength of the job market is another critical factor. Economic Projections: Powell will likely provide updated economic forecasts. Interest Rate Outlook: While he won’t commit to specific cuts, his language on future policy will be scrutinized. Response to Political Pressure: How he handles questions regarding political influence on Fed decisions. How Federal Reserve Decision-Making Shapes the US Economy Outlook The Federal Reserve Decision to raise or lower interest rates is arguably the most powerful tool in its arsenal for steering the US Economy Outlook . When rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation. Conversely, lower rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending, investment, and economic growth. Trump’s call for significant cuts reflects a desire for a more expansionary monetary policy, believing it will unleash economic potential. However, economists often debate the precise impact and potential pitfalls of such aggressive moves. Potential Economic Impacts of Aggressive Rate Cuts: Stimulated Growth: Lower borrowing costs can spur business expansion and consumer spending. Increased Debt: Cheaper money can lead to higher levels of corporate and government debt. Inflationary Pressure: Too much money in circulation can lead to a rise in prices. Dollar Weakness: Lower rates can make the U.S. dollar less attractive, impacting trade. Asset Bubbles: Cheap money can inflate asset prices, potentially leading to bubbles in real estate or stocks. The Fed’s challenge is to find the ‘Goldilocks’ zone – not too hot, not too cold – to ensure sustainable growth without triggering runaway inflation or a recession. This delicate balancing act is what makes every Federal Reserve Decision so impactful. Navigating Interest Rate Cuts: Implications for Crypto Markets For the cryptocurrency community, the prospect of significant Interest Rate Cuts by the Federal Reserve carries profound implications. Crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are often viewed as ‘risk-on’ assets, meaning they tend to perform well when investors have a higher appetite for risk. Lower interest rates typically lead to: Increased Liquidity: When traditional investments offer lower returns, capital often flows into riskier, higher-potential assets like cryptocurrencies. Weaker Dollar: A weaker U.S. dollar, often a consequence of lower rates, can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If aggressive rate cuts lead to concerns about inflation, Bitcoin’s narrative as a digital store of value and inflation hedge could gain traction. Reduced Cost of Capital: For crypto projects and companies, lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, potentially fueling innovation and expansion within the industry. Conversely, if Powell’s testimony indicates a more hawkish (higher rates) or even a neutral stance, it could temper the enthusiasm for risk assets. The market’s reaction to the testimony will be critical, as it will signal whether the Fed is leaning towards an easing cycle that could benefit crypto, or maintaining a tighter policy. Comparison: High vs. Low Interest Rates and Crypto Factor High Interest Rates Low Interest Rates (Trump’s Proposal) Borrowing Cost Expensive Cheap Traditional Returns Higher (e.g., bonds) Lower Risk Appetite Lower (flight to safety) Higher (search for yield) Crypto Impact Potential headwinds, capital outflow Potential tailwinds, capital inflow Dollar Strength Stronger Weaker Expert Insights and Future Projections for the US Economy Outlook Economists and market analysts are divided on the optimal path for the US Economy Outlook . Some argue that the economy remains robust, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target, making aggressive rate cuts premature. They fear that such cuts could reignite inflationary pressures and lead to instability. Others contend that the economy is showing signs of cooling and that preemptive cuts are necessary to avoid a recession. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed’s rate policy, typically moves cautiously, preferring to observe data trends rather than reacting to political calls. The consensus view, prior to Trump’s recent comments, was that the Fed would likely implement one or two modest rate cuts later in the year, assuming inflation continued to trend downwards. Trump’s intervention, however, adds a layer of political complexity that could influence market sentiment, even if the Fed remains steadfast in its independence. Investors will be closely watching for any signals from Powell regarding the Fed’s reaction function to incoming data and, subtly, to external pressures. What to Watch For: Powell’s Tone: Is he dovish (leaning towards cuts) or hawkish (leaning against cuts)? Economic Data Releases: Future CPI, PPI, and jobs reports will be crucial. FOMC Statements: The language used in upcoming Fed meeting summaries. Geopolitical Events: Global events can quickly shift economic priorities. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Economic Showdown Donald Trump’s assertive call for substantial Interest Rate Cuts has set the stage for a compelling economic narrative, particularly ahead of Jerome Powell’s Testimony . While the Federal Reserve Decision -making process is designed to be independent, the sheer weight of such public demands from a prominent political figure cannot be entirely ignored by the markets. The ensuing debate highlights the fundamental tension between political expediency and sound monetary policy. For those invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, these macroeconomic shifts are not mere headlines; they are critical indicators of the broader financial environment that shapes digital asset valuations. The coming days will reveal how the Fed navigates these pressures, and the ripple effects will undoubtedly be felt across the entire financial spectrum, from traditional stocks to the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed and understanding these complex interplays is key to making strategic decisions in an ever-evolving economic landscape.

2025-06-24T09:59:47,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.18677004 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.18677004 9.67% Market cap $ 128,885,279,435.54 Circulating Supply 58,938,652,386.00 Trading Volume $ 5,126,196,864.4283 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Since then, it has slipped below a key high-volume profile level. In June, XRP is trying to hold above the previous month’s swing low support at $2.10. However, any upside potential has been limited under worsening geopolitical conditions with the Iran and Israel conflict. Many were expecting a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but that, too, ended up in a 60-day pause in appeals. Also, on June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton XRP spot ETF amid ongoing conflicts. In the third week of June, the US bombed some Iranian nuclear sites, shaking investor sentiment seen even in top crypto. As a result of the past few days ‘ internal and external developments, the XRP price marked a low of $1.94, breaking below the 200-day EMA and alongside last month’s swing low support area. However, a quick climb in XRP price was witnessed on June 24th, rising over 12% with a ceasefire announced, turning it into a short-term battle. The improved investor sentiment shows less panic among investors this time, and a tremendous “buy-the-dip” philosophy has been exercised amid the chaos of battle. Yet, danger still lingers for XRP amid the renewed bullishness. If a ceasefire is broken, then the pressure could rise. That could push the XRP price down because a bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs remains active. If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the $2.10 support—which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA—the price could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. On the upside, if any external or internal factor becomes a catalyst and boosts XRP price, XRP must break past the short-term EMA crossover and reclaim the key $2.40 resistance. Doing so could trigger a rally toward $2.80, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in June or July. However, momentum depends heavily on a substantial rising volume, as witnessed last April to mid-May. On comparing volume to June, the rise in whale transaction count (>1m USD) contributed to increased exchange outflow. The volume is currently testing a declining trendline; if volume spikes more and breaches this volume trendline, a spark could be witnessed in sessions ahead. However, things would reverse if no clear and strong catalyst appeared, and then a flash crash could occur on the bearish plate. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T09:50:10,"Metaplanet’s Bold Strategic $5 Billion Bitcoin Capital Allocation to US Subsidiary","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Bold Strategic $5 Billion Bitcoin Capital Allocation to US Subsidiary In a move that has sent ripples across the global financial landscape, Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese firm renowned for its proactive embrace of Bitcoin (BTC), has announced an extraordinary expansion of its digital asset strategy. The company revealed on X its intention to allocate an additional capital of up to $5 billion to its U.S. subsidiary. This decisive action underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to integrate digital assets into their core financial frameworks, particularly when seeking optimal environments for growth and stability. Metaplanet’s commitment to strengthening its Bitcoin holdings through this substantial capital allocation is a testament to its long-term vision for the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet’s Pioneering Journey into Bitcoin and Digital Assets For those unfamiliar, Metaplanet has distinguished itself as a trailblazer among publicly traded companies in Japan by adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy in the United States, positioning Metaplanet as a key player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in Asia. Their initial foray into Bitcoin was driven by a desire to hedge against currency depreciation and seek long-term value appreciation, moving beyond traditional financial instruments. This latest announcement of an additional $5 billion in capital signifies not just a continuation, but a dramatic acceleration of their Bitcoin-centric strategy. It’s a clear signal that the company sees immense potential in Bitcoin, not merely as a speculative asset, but as a fundamental component of its future financial health. This move could inspire other Japanese and Asian corporations to re-evaluate their own treasury management strategies and consider a similar pivot towards digital assets . Why the US Subsidiary? Unpacking the ‘Optimal Conditions’ for Bitcoin Acquisition Metaplanet explicitly stated that the United States offers “optimal conditions” for acquiring and managing Bitcoin at scale. But what exactly makes the U.S. such an attractive destination for a Japanese firm looking to bolster its crypto holdings? Several factors likely contribute to this strategic choice: Regulatory Clarity (Comparatively): While the U.S. regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, it has seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has provided a degree of institutional comfort and established clear pathways for large-scale digital asset investments, offering more certainty than many other jurisdictions. Mature Market Infrastructure: The U.S. boasts a robust and sophisticated financial infrastructure, including well-established crypto exchanges, custody solutions, and liquidity providers capable of handling multi-billion dollar transactions. This infrastructure is crucial for efficient and secure large-scale Bitcoin acquisition. Access to Capital and Expertise: The U.S. financial market is deep and liquid, offering ample access to capital markets and a wealth of expertise in digital asset management, trading, and compliance. This allows companies like Metaplanet to leverage specialized knowledge and resources. Investor Base and Adoption: The U.S. has a large and increasingly sophisticated investor base with a growing appetite for Bitcoin and other digital assets, which can influence market stability and liquidity for large holders. By channeling this massive capital allocation through its US subsidiary , Metaplanet aims to capitalize on these favorable conditions, ensuring its Bitcoin acquisition strategy is executed with maximum efficiency and security. The Mechanics of a $5 Billion Capital Allocation: What Does it Mean? The phrase “up to an additional $5 billion” indicates a significant commitment, though the exact timeline and deployment strategy might be flexible. This capital could be deployed in various ways, primarily focused on accumulating more Bitcoin : Direct Bitcoin Purchases: The most straightforward approach would be direct market purchases of BTC, similar to MicroStrategy’s strategy. This would involve leveraging their U.S. subsidiary to execute large block trades or dollar-cost average into Bitcoin over time. Investment in Bitcoin-Related Products: While direct purchases are likely, some capital could also be allocated to Bitcoin-related investment vehicles, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, if they align with Metaplanet’s strategic goals for liquidity and custody. Infrastructure and Operational Expansion: A portion of the capital might also be used to expand the operational capabilities of the US subsidiary , ensuring it has the necessary infrastructure, talent, and security protocols to manage such a substantial digital asset portfolio. This $5 billion commitment is not just a financial decision; it’s a strategic declaration. It signals Metaplanet’s profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its readiness to make substantial, calculated bets on the future of digital assets within a preferred regulatory environment. Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal: Benefits and Considerations for Corporate Treasuries Metaplanet’s move highlights the compelling reasons why corporations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The primary benefits often cited include: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation and currency debasement, offering an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global accessibility position it as a modern store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering a higher upside compared to traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s treasury portfolio, reducing reliance on single asset classes and potentially enhancing overall returns. However, corporate adoption of Bitcoin is not without its considerations. Volatility remains a key factor, as do evolving regulatory frameworks and the complexities of secure custody. Metaplanet’s decision to route this through its US subsidiary suggests a careful consideration of these factors, aiming to mitigate risks by operating within a jurisdiction deemed “optimal.” This thoughtful approach to capital allocation is crucial for any company venturing into the digital asset space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption? Metaplanet’s monumental $5 billion capital allocation to its US subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition sends a powerful message to the global financial community. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable corporate treasury asset, even among companies outside the immediate Western financial sphere. This could trigger a domino effect, especially among other Japanese and Asian corporations that have been observing the crypto space cautiously. As regulatory clarity improves globally and the infrastructure for managing digital assets matures, more companies may follow Metaplanet’s lead, diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin. This trend, if it accelerates, will have profound implications for Bitcoin’s price discovery, market liquidity, and its overall integration into the mainstream financial system. For investors, Metaplanet’s move serves as another strong indicator of institutional conviction in Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is evolving from a niche speculative asset to a foundational element of corporate finance. Keeping an eye on similar announcements from other publicly traded companies will be crucial for understanding the broader trajectory of institutional crypto adoption. A Bold Leap Forward for Metaplanet and Bitcoin Metaplanet’s decision to inject an additional $5 billion into its U.S. subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition is nothing short of a bold and strategic maneuver. It highlights the company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the strategic advantage of operating within a jurisdiction that offers “optimal conditions” for digital asset management. This significant capital allocation not only reinforces Metaplanet ‘s position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption but also serves as a powerful testament to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the global economy. As more companies witness the potential benefits and navigate the complexities, Metaplanet’s pioneering spirit may well pave the way for a new era of corporate treasury management.

Let’s sort out the facts from the noise. What’s the Claim? Many posts on X and Telegram groups are saying, “If you held XRP during the snapshot, you’re getting NIGHT tokens for free.” It sounds exciting — who wouldn’t want free tokens just for holding crypto? So, What’s the Truth? Yes, XRP holders will receive NIGHT tokens, but only if they meet the eligibility. According to the official 45-page whitepaper released by the Midnight team, the airdrop is being shared across eight blockchains. These include Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, BAT, and XRP. To qualify, you needed to hold at least $100 worth of XRP when the snapshot was taken on June 11, 2025. There’s no need for KYC or any fees—claiming is as simple as signing with your wallet and submitting a valid Cardano address. However, the tokens will be locked at first, and 25% will unlock slowly over a year. How Did We Find That Out? The Midnight team detailed all of this in their whitepaper, breaking down the token supply and distribution plan. Out of the total NIGHT token supply, 50% (12 billion tokens) is set aside for Cardano (ADA) holders. Bitcoin (BTC) holders will receive the next biggest share, 20%, which is about 4.8 billion NIGHT tokens. The final 30% (7.2 billion NIGHT tokens) will be shared equally among six other blockchains: XRP, BAT, ETH, BNB, SOL, and AVAX. That means XRP holders are eligible to claim around 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens from this pool. So yes, if you held XRP during the eligible snapshot, you could qualify for a piece of that 1.2 billion NIGHT allocation. But your share depends on how much XRP you held at the snapshot time",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/fact-check-will-xrp-holders-receive-night-tokens/,"ADA|BAT|BTC|XRP|AIRDROP","Uncategorized",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T09:46:47,"Bitcoin Set for Biggest Mining Difficulty Drop Since July 2021","Mining difficulty on the Bitcoin BTC blockchain is on course to drop by the most since July 2021 after the amount of mining power securing the network slid about 30% in two weeks. According to data from Mempool.space , a downward difficulty adjustment of around 9% is projected within the next five days. That would be the most since the China mining ban four years ago, when the hashrate, the total computational power used to mine blocks, plummeted 50% to 58 exahashes per second (EH/s) and bitcoin was trading near $30,000. The difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to ensure that blocks continue to be mined at roughly 10-minute intervals. After the recent decline, the hashrate is now just under 700 EH/s, according to Glassnode data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading recently around $105,300. Significant hashrate and difficulty corrections are not unusual during the northern hemisphere's summer. Elevated electricity prices, driven by higher air conditioning demand and strained power grids, often lead miners to temporarily shut off machines, especially older or less efficient ones. This seasonal pattern has been observed in several previous years. The anticipated drop in mining difficulty will provide meaningful relief for miners. The hashprice, or miner revenue per exahash, currently sits at $51.9. This metric reflects the estimated daily income in dollars a miner earns per EH/s contributed to the network, based on block rewards and transaction fees. As difficulty decreases, mining becomes easier, meaning miners can earn more revenue for the same amount of computational effort. Assuming bitcoin’s price and transaction fees remain stable or increase, the hashprice should rise significantly in the coming days, helping to offset recent profitability pressure.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/bitcoin-set-for-biggest-mining-difficulty-drop-since-july-2021,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Mining Difficulty|Hashrate|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin’s climb past $106K earlier today was cut short as news broke that Iran had violated a ceasefire deal with Israel, just hours after it was supposedly brokered by US President Donald Trump. The sudden escalation sent shockwaves through the market, triggering over $500 million in crypto liquidations within the hour. Long positions were hit the hardest as the market reversed. By press time, Bitcoin had slipped back below $105K, giving up most of its earlier gains. Ceasefire Off the Table, Tensions Spike What triggered the panic? Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, announced “intense strikes” on Tehran after accusing Iran of breaking the US-Qatar-mediated truce. The situation escalated rapidly, with the Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir stating. ""In light of the severe violation of the ceasefire carried out by the Iranian regime, we will respond with force."" -The Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir in a situational assessment now — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) June 24, 2025 Iran has denied any ceasefire breach, but its top security council says the nation is fully prepared to retaliate if provoked. The ceasefire was meant to de-escalate regional tensions. But with missiles now back on the table, global markets are on edge, and crypto is once again acting as a volatility sponge. $500M Liquidated: Crypto Whales Take a Hit With the ceasefire unraveling in real time, traders scrambled. Liquidations soared to $500 million, signaling panic among leveraged long positions. The sudden move has shaken confidence just as Bitcoin was reclaiming bullish territory. “Time to Buy the Dip,” Says Van de Poppe Despite the turbulence, some seasoned traders see opportunity. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe believes Bitcoin is still in an upward trend, calling the pullback a healthy retest. “Bitcoin has a trendswitch. It’s uptrending now, after we’ve had a massive liquidation crash taking place to sub $100K. It broke through $103K and hit the next resistance. Time to be buying the dip…” For dip buyers, $103K may be the key accumulation zone to watch. Trump Turns Up the Heat on the Fed Beyond the battlefield, Trump had more to say – this time targeting the Federal Reserve. In a pointed post on Truth Social, the president slammed Fed Chair Jerome Powell for holding rates steady at the June FOMC meeting. “No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus.” Trump also said if the cuts don’t work out, Powell could hike again but warned Congress to “work this very dumb, hardheaded person over.” What Now for Crypto? Between rising geopolitical tensions and renewed pressure on the Fed, the crypto market is caught in the middle. Bitcoin’s recent pullback might just be noise or the start of a bigger shift.

The cryptocurrency remains 1.3% down for the week but the recovery seems to have started and, hopefully, it will continue. However, for this to happen, both Israel and Iran need to honor the agreement.

2025-06-24T09:44:20,"The “silent” co-founder of Ripple speaks for the firs time in 14 years","Arthur Britto, the “silent” co-founder of Ripple Labs and architect behind the XRP Ledger, made his first public communication on social media after 14 years of silence. The reticent figure, known for his secrecy and absence from public life, posted a single emoji on X late Monday, prompting an 8% surge in the value of XRP within 24 hours. Britto posted a single “face without mouth” emoji from his X account created in August 2011. Regardless of his intent, the XRP’s community reaction was immediate, largely due to his status as a founder who has avoided the spotlight since Ripple’s inception. Asserting that “it was not a hack or compromise,” David Schwartz—currently chief technology officer at Ripple and co-creator of the XRP Ledger—verified that Britto was the one who sent the message. ‘Ghost’ XRPL co-creator speaks after years of silence Not much is known about Arthur Britto, but according to Shwartz, he co-created the XRP Ledger in 2012 alongside Jed McCaleb, the latter also known for founding Mt. Gox and later the Stellar blockchain. Together, they launched what was initially known as NewCoin, later renamed OpenCoin, and finally Ripple Labs. In 2015, he slapped Jed McCaleb with a lawsuit, accusing him of breaching a contract by launching Stellar and allegedly copying Ripple’s code. The case was reportedly settled out of court, and the full terms of the settlement were never publicly disclosed. Though instrumental in building XRPL , Britto has stayed almost entirely invisible. He has never given a public interview, never appeared at a public event, and no verified photographs of him exist. His name is in public records and legal filings, but outside of official documentation, Britto’s persona has been more myth than man. The XRP co-founder is also listed as the founder and president of PolySign, a blockchain infrastructure firm. He also briefly served as a director at Bitstamp in 2014 before his role was terminated in 2015. Real, but as private as Satoshi Britto’s privacy has led to theories that he might be a pseudonym or not a real person. Others believe he is the person behind crypto’s most famous pseudonym, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. “ He is so private that he’s one of my dark horse candidates for being Satosh i,” one Reddit user remarked. David Schwartz addressed these rumors in a November 2023 post, proving Britto’s existence, adding that the developer is very insistent on privacy. “ He is a separate and distinct human being in his own right. But he is intensely private ,” Schwartz dispelled the chatter that Britto is a ghost in the Ripple machine. Additional evidence of Britto’s identity was found in a Ripple community post circulating on X earlier this month. The post included a 2012 agreement signed by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto. Dated September 17, the document awarded Britto 2% of all XRP, then referred to as “Ripple Credits,” and granted him lifetime rights to build on the Ripple protocol without needing future permission. Schwartz confirmed the document’s authenticity and noted that he is in contact with Britto. XRP price rally after community excitement After dropping to an intraday low of $1.97 one hour after Britto posted the emoji, XRP has climbed up 8.1% in the last day. Many traders interpreted the post as a bullish signal, buoyed by its cryptic nature. “ Bullrun confirmed? Too early to say. But Arthur Britto doesn’t casually drop breadcrumbs. When someone this silent speaks … you listen. In crypto, silence can be louder than noise. And Britto just broke his. Stay alert. Something’s coming ,” reckoned XRP enthusiast John Squire .

2025-06-24T09:42:43,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Panther Metals unveils Bitcoin treasury strategy","UK-listed mineral exploration firm Panther Metals Plc has announced a new treasury strategy that integrates Bitcoin with its traditional mining assets. As more corporations incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios to diversify their assets, early-stage projects like Bitcoin Pepe are expected to gain from the growing optimism surrounding crypto assets. Bitcoin acquisition In a statement, Panther Metals detailed plans to acquire £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin as part of its treasury management strategy. As part of this move, the company will use £1.3 million ($1.75 million) of its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finalise the acquisition of the Pick Lake mining deposit in Ontario, Canada. “This allows the Company to complete the Pick Lake acquisition whilst retaining its total exposure to Bitcoin,” the firm noted, emphasising that Bitcoin will be treated as “productive capital” rather than simply held passively, as is common among other Bitcoin-holding companies. The company stated that its physical commodity portfolio, which includes critical minerals, gold, and other precious metals, will continue to expand, with support from the Bitcoin treasury. The firm also intends to grow its Bitcoin holdings over time. Panther Metals CEO Darren Hazelwood highlighted that this hybrid approach enables the company to finance high-quality mineral projects while minimising shareholder dilution, benefiting from the comparatively favourable financing terms in the digital asset space. Minerals and Bitcoin: a strategic blend The Pick Lake deposit is part of the broader Winston Project, which hosts about 85% of the project’s overall mineral resources. The Winston deposit is described as an advanced-stage polymetallic property, rich in zinc, copper, and precious metals. It offers potential for high-grade mining redevelopment and resource expansion. Zinc, in particular, is considered a critical mineral due to its importance in steel galvanisation and battery technology. Hazelwood stated that by combining the “stability of physical resources with the flexibility of digital capital,” the company aims to build a resilient business capable of navigating various market cycles. Bitcoin treasury adoption expands among corporations Panther Metals joins a growing number of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. Earlier this week, real estate investor Grant Cardone announced the purchase of 1,000 BTC for his firm’s treasury. Meanwhile, established Bitcoin advocates such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan-based Metaplanet continue to increase their holdings, now at 592,345 BTC and 11,111 BTC, respectively. Bitcoin Pepe gains traction with a utility-focused approach Bitcoin Pepe is establishing itself as a notable player in the cryptocurrency market by combining meme-inspired branding with a focus on tangible utility and infrastructure development. Unlike many meme tokens that primarily depend on social media buzz, Bitcoin Pepe is pursuing a defined technical roadmap. This structured direction appears to be attracting investor interest, with Bitcoin Pepe having raised more than $15 million during its ongoing presale phase. The project’s team has announced that its native token, BPEP, is set to be listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges MEXC and BitMart. These listings are anticipated to improve the token’s visibility, trading liquidity, and perceived legitimacy as it moves closer to a wider market launch. An official announcement regarding the exchange listings is expected on June 30.

2025-06-24T09:39:44,"PolitiFi tokens add $196M as COIN Act restricts presidential crypto gains","Cryptocurrencies remained elevated on Tuesday as Donald Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, cooling the escalating Middle East tensions. Bitcoin has jumped from weekend lows or around $98,000 to $105,809 at press time. Also, top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana gained up to 10% in the past 24 hours amid renewed optimism. While analysts anticipate continued uptrends and potential breakouts, investor attention remained on political-themed cryptos due to the renewed regulatory developments. In a bold move to distinguish public services from private gains, Senator Adam Schiff dropped the COIN (Curbing Official’s Income and Nondisclosure) Act yesterday. According to Adam Schiff, the COIN Act would prohibit the president, the vice president, his kids, and the first family, as well as top executive officials or special employees like Elon Musk. It would prohibit them from issuing a digital currency, from endorsing, or sponsoring one. Schiff’s bill seeks to ban the US president, Vice president, senior officials, and their families from advertising or profiting from digital asset undertakings while in office. The market reacted swiftly to these developments, with PolitiFi coins’ market cap increasing by nearly 10% from $2,006,990,100 to press time’s $2,203,062,675. Source – Coingecko The notable gain followed massive rallies in top political-tied tokens. Department of Government Efficiency, Pepe Trump, and the America Party memes soared up to 30% in the previous 24 hours. The sector’s trading volume increased remarkably within the past day to $622,950,060. That reflects renewed investor and trader interest in cryptocurrencies linked to politicians. The activity surge comes as PolitiFi tokens remain in the spotlight following the proposed legislation, which follows mounting concerns over Trump’s crypto investments. Schiff stated that the president and his sons earned around $57 million in Q1 2025 from the World Liberty stablecoin venture. The US president also participated in activities related to digital exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tokenized assets, and Bitcoin mining. Furthermore, Trump’s crypto regulation moves have raised worries over conflicts of interest. Recently, he argued HOUSE to act “Lighting fast” in passing the Genius bill . Understanding the COIN Act The bill aims to prevent mixing politics with digital asset profits. Adam Schiff @SenAdamSchiff · Follow Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I’m introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. Watch on Twitter View replies 2:03 PM · Jun 23, 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies If passed, the COIN Act would ban high-ranking government officials from various crypto undertakings. First and foremost, it will bar officials from launching, endorsing, or advertising any virtual assets, including NFTs, stablecoins, meme tokens, and tokenized ETFs. Violations would attract serious consequences, including a 5-year jail term and profit forfeiture. While Schiff’s bill applies to all high-ranking officials, it has likely stemmed from Trump’s crypto dealings. The US president launched his meme token in January days before his inauguration. He recently organized a private dinner with holders of his meme token , a move that attracted a massive backlash. Moreover, Trump Media has reaffirmed its plan to accumulate Bitcoin worth $2.3 billion. Schiff added that the president has profited from various branded merchandizes, including Watches, Sneakers, and the Make America Pray Again Bible. Schiff believes such levels of crypto involvement pose serious ethical risks. The Senator’s concerns match Ethereum’s Buterin, who called politician-backed cryptos ‘vehicles for unlimited political bribery .” The post PolitiFi tokens add $196M as COIN Act restricts presidential crypto gains appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/24/politifi-tokens-add-196m-as-coin-act-restricts-presidential-crypto-gains/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION","Altcoins|Blockchain technology|Crypto|Crypto business|Crypto crime|Crypto regulation|DeFi|Meme Coin|NFT|Stablecoin|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T09:29:09,"Can Holding Crypto Help You Get a Mortgage? US Housing Chief Explores the Possibility","The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) may soon explore the role of crypto holdings in mortgage qualification, according to a statement from its director, Bill Pulte. Key Takeaways: The FHFA is considering whether crypto holdings could factor into mortgage eligibility. Director Bill Pulte, a vocal crypto supporter, holds significant stakes in Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin adoption is accelerating across both federal and state levels. “We will study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages,” Pulte announced Monday on X . While specifics on implementation remain unclear, the move marks a notable shift for the regulator overseeing major entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. FHFA Becomes a Pillar of US Housing Stability Created in the aftermath of the 2008 housing crisis, the FHFA has historically focused on risk reduction and ensuring liquidity in the housing market. Now, it may become one of the first federal housing agencies to consider digital assets in mortgage lending criteria. Bill Pulte, appointed director in March after being nominated by former President Donald Trump, brings a unique background to the role. He is the founder of Pulte Capital Partners and the grandson of William Pulte, who founded Pulte Homes, currently the third-largest homebuilder in the US. Smart — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) June 24, 2025 Pulte has been vocal about his support for cryptocurrency. Financial disclosures earlier this year revealed he holds between $500,001 and $1 million in both Bitcoin and Solana. His portfolio also includes shares in Marathon Digital (MARA), a major bitcoin mining firm, as well as investments in GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond, Tesla, and ventures tied to YouTube personality MrBeast. Pulte entered the crypto space in 2019, publicly announcing a purchase of 11 BTC and pledging to distribute crypto to his social media followers. His interest in digital assets appears to extend beyond personal finance, potentially influencing policy at the national level. Bitcoin Adoption Finds Momentum Among States Bitcoin adoption is accelerating across both federal and state levels in the US. Texas recently became the first state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, following the approval of Senate Bill 21 signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The reserve, managed by State Comptroller Glenn Hegar, will operate independently from the state treasury, a key distinction from earlier proposals in Arizona and New Hampshire, which were tied to existing government funds. At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, signaling growing institutional interest in the asset. While Texas moves forward with its Bitcoin initiative, other states are pulling back. Florida, Arizona, and several others have recently shelved or rejected crypto-related legislation, citing concerns over market volatility and the uncertain future of digital assets.

2025-06-24T09:20:23,"Trump’s Breakthrough: Iran-Israel Ceasefire Sparks Hope for Global Stability","BitcoinWorld Trump’s Breakthrough: Iran-Israel Ceasefire Sparks Hope for Global Stability In a surprising and potentially monumental development, U.S. President Donald Trump recently took to his Truth Social platform to announce that an Iran-Israel ceasefire is now in effect. This declaration, if upheld by all parties, carries immense weight for global affairs, promising a potential shift towards greater geopolitical stability in a region long plagued by tension. For those of us navigating the often-volatile waters of the cryptocurrency world, such news isn’t just a headline; it’s a critical signal that could ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from traditional stocks to the burgeoning digital asset space. Understanding the Iran-Israel Ceasefire Announcement The news broke directly from Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, a platform that has increasingly become a source for his public statements. The simplicity of the announcement belies its potential complexity and significance: a ceasefire, an agreement to halt hostilities, between two nations whose relationship has been defined by decades of antagonism and proxy conflicts. This isn’t merely a pause; it’s presented as an active agreement that all parties are now called upon to uphold. Direct Communication: The use of Truth Social highlights the evolving landscape of diplomatic communication, allowing for immediate dissemination of high-stakes information. Call to Uphold: Trump’s emphasis on all parties upholding the agreement underscores the fragility and importance of adherence for its success. Immediate Impact: Such an announcement can immediately influence market sentiment, shifting from fear to cautious optimism. The implications of a verifiable and sustained Iran-Israel ceasefire extend far beyond the immediate region. It touches upon energy markets, global trade routes, and international diplomacy, creating a domino effect that reaches into every corner of the global economy, including the often-unpredictable crypto market impact . What Does Geopolitical Stability Mean for Global Markets? When tensions rise in critical regions like the Middle East, financial markets often react with apprehension. Investors seek safety, leading to capital flight from riskier assets. Conversely, signs of de-escalation and geopolitical stability tend to foster confidence, encouraging investment and growth. Historically, periods of conflict have seen: Oil Price Volatility: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Stability can lead to more predictable supply and potentially lower prices. Stock Market Fluctuations: Major indices often dip during crises as investor confidence wanes. Stability can bring a rebound. Safe-Haven Asset Demand: Gold, U.S. Treasuries, and increasingly, Bitcoin, often see increased demand during uncertainty. A confirmed ceasefire could signal a reduction in systemic risk, potentially calming nerves across all asset classes. This newfound stability might redirect capital flows, impacting everything from commodity prices to technology stocks. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven? The cryptocurrency market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts. While often seen as uncorrelated, major global events inevitably cast a long shadow over digital assets. The news of an Iran-Israel ceasefire could have a multi-faceted crypto market impact . Many in the crypto community champion Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold – a true Bitcoin safe haven asset. The theory is that in times of geopolitical turmoil or economic uncertainty, investors will flock to Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from traditional financial systems. Let’s look at this: Asset Type Reaction to Instability Reaction to Stability Traditional Stocks Typically decline (risk-off) Tend to rally (risk-on) Gold Often rises (traditional safe haven) May stabilize or slightly decline U.S. Treasuries Rally (flight to safety) Yields may rise (less demand for safety) Bitcoin Mixed; sometimes acts as safe haven, sometimes correlates with tech stocks Potential for increased adoption if stability fosters innovation If the ceasefire holds, the immediate reaction might be a slight dip in Bitcoin’s price as some ‘safe haven’ demand diminishes. However, sustained global peace efforts and stability could also pave the way for broader institutional adoption and a more mature crypto market, as confidence in the overall global economic outlook improves. A stable environment encourages innovation and long-term investment, which could ultimately benefit the crypto space by attracting new users and capital. The Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Global Peace Efforts While the announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire is undoubtedly positive, the path to lasting peace is rarely straightforward. There are significant challenges that lie ahead for global peace efforts : Verification and Monitoring: Ensuring all parties adhere to the agreement requires robust verification mechanisms. Addressing Root Causes: A ceasefire addresses symptoms, but underlying political, economic, and social issues need long-term solutions. Regional Actors: The involvement and cooperation of other regional and international powers will be crucial. Trust Building: Decades of mistrust cannot be undone overnight; consistent diplomatic efforts are essential. Despite these hurdles, the opportunity for a new era of stability in the Middle East is immense. Reduced conflict can free up resources for economic development, improve humanitarian conditions, and foster greater regional cooperation. For the global economy, this translates into more predictable supply chains, stable energy prices, and a more confident investment climate. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Community? For investors, this news underscores the importance of staying informed about geopolitical developments. While the initial reaction to such news might be a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, it’s crucial to consider the long-term implications. For the crypto community, it highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role and the broader market’s sensitivity to global events. Actionable Insights: Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional and digital assets, can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Geopolitical news can turn markets quickly. Keep an eye on official announcements and reputable news sources. Understand Bitcoin’s Nuance: While a Bitcoin safe haven narrative exists, its correlation with traditional markets can vary. It’s not a guaranteed hedge against all forms of instability. Look Beyond the Headlines: A ceasefire is a step, not the destination. Assess whether the underlying conditions for lasting peace are being addressed. The potential for reduced tensions in the Middle East is a significant positive signal for geopolitical stability . While the immediate crypto market impact may vary, the long-term prospects for innovation and growth in a more peaceful world are undoubtedly brighter. A New Horizon for Peace and Prosperity? Donald Trump’s announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire marks a pivotal moment, offering a glimpse of a future where dialogue replaces conflict. While the path to enduring global peace efforts is fraught with challenges, this initial step provides a foundation upon which greater stability can be built. For the financial world, particularly the crypto market, this development is a reminder that global events are inextricably linked to market dynamics. As we move forward, the hope is that this ceasefire will not just be a temporary halt but a catalyst for sustained de-escalation, paving the way for a more secure and prosperous global landscape for all.

2025-06-24T09:17:56,"Crypto tax Australia: How does Australia tax their crypto?","A recent ruling in a criminal court case classified crypto assets as money, which goes against the long-held crypto tax Australian office that counts crypto as capital gains. A court decision involving a federal police officer who allegedly stole 81.6 BTC in 2019 has resurfaced as more traders are contesting how cryptocurrency should be taxed in Australia . On May 19, Judge Michael O’Connell ruled that Bitcoin ( BTC ) should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. This means that the judge declared that Bitcoin is more similar to the Australian dollar, rather than a speculative asset like gold , shares or foreign currency. According to the Australian Taxation Office website , crypto tax Australia classifies crypto under property instead of currency. More specifically, crypto falls under capital gains tax under the current framework used by the taxation office. You might also like: South Korea to postpone Crypto Tax bill to 2027 As of June 24, the website still categorizes crypto under property with capital gains on swaps, DeFi, and wrapped tokens. However the ruling could mean that Bitcoin falls under fiat currency, potentially exempting it from the current capital gains tax framework. How is crypto tax Australia operated? Under the current framework, crypto is seen as an investment. Therefore, crypto assets fall under the capital gains tax mechanism. According to the website, activities that involve making transactions with crypto —such as selling, swapping or spending crypto— is considered a capital gains tax event. On the other hand, the revenue generated from mining, staking, or earning crypto counts as ordinary income instead of capital gains. In those cases, then the ordinary income tax would be applied to the profit. However, crypto assets meant for personal use with a value of below AUD 10,000 ($6,503) is considered an exemption to the capital gains tax. But anything above the threshold would be subject to CGT under the crypto tax Australia framework. Most recently, Australia introduced cash transaction limits for crypto ATMs. The regulation mandates crypto ATM operators to implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars or equal to $3,251. Not only that, operators must also display notices, warning users of potential fraud risks.

2025-06-24T09:15:30,"New US Banking Cartel Forming As JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Others Dominate American Deposits, Warns ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman","Legendary investor Steve Eisman is warning the public about the possible emergence of a “cartel” of major banks in the US, which he says could impact the cost of financial services. The Wall Street veteran notes in a new interview with The Compound that there hasn’t been a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the banking sector since the 1990s. “It’s been very much discouraged post Dodd-Frank, so you’ve had very, very little M&A. But I actually think as a country we need [a wave of M&A]. And the reason why I say that is here’s an interesting statistic: in 2007, JPMorgan’s share of deposits in the United States was 7%, today it’s close to 14%. Now, there are a couple of reasons for that: number one is the cost of regulation is very, very high, and they can bear that more easily, and number two, which is probably even more important, is the cost of technology has exploded, and you need to be really big so you can pay for it. So if we do nothing and we keep the current policies and there’s no M&A wave, what’s going to happen is JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and a handful of others will continue to take market share, the other regional banks are going to wither on the vine, and what you’ll have left is a couple of very, very large banks and some community banks.” Eisman, whose bet against the housing market was famously profiled in parts of Michael Lewis’ book “The Big Short,” says financial institutions like US Bank and Comerica should merge to compete with the giant firms. “I don’t want to be Canada, where it’s basically a cartel, and so therefore those banks get to charge a lot more to customers.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
