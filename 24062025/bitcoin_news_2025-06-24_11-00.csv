Corporate holdings—both public and private—have not only surged in quantity but have also surpassed the projected annual Bitcoin issuance of 164,250 BTC. This shift is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity, the rising perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and the growing demand for decentralized financial assets. Public Companies : Hold over 725,000 BTC, more than a 135% increase from 2024. Private Companies : Estimated to hold over 300,000 BTC, though transparency remains limited. Total Corporate Holdings : Likely exceeds 1 million BTC, rivaling sovereign holdings. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption — A Global Trend In 2024, only 64 public companies held Bitcoin on their balance sheets. As of June 2025, 151 public firms have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This growth is influenced by: U.S. policy shift recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset . Institutional frameworks and clearer taxation laws globally. Public endorsements from high-profile business leaders and political figures.

Conclusion: The Institutional Bitcoin Era Is Here The corporate accumulation of Bitcoin in 2025 marks a turning point in global finance. With public firms now holding more Bitcoin than the annual supply and private firms quietly amassing large reserves, Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset—it’s a mainstream corporate treasury standard.While price volatility remains, the adoption curve indicates that strategic Bitcoin reserves are becoming the norm, not the exception. The trend is expected to continue as more companies—particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and North America—announce their Bitcoin treasury models. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yep, it absolutely is. Public company holdings more than doubled from 2024 — from 64 companies to 151. Firms are no longer experimenting — they’re going all in, especially after the U.S. government signaled policy support. Did companies really buy more Bitcoin than what was mined in 2025? Yes, and it’s kinda wild. The total BTC mined this year is around 164,250 BTC , but corporate holdings have eclipsed 725,000 BTC just from public companies alone. Add private firms to that and you’re looking at 1M+ BTC in corporate wallets. Which public companies are leading in Bitcoin holdings? There’s frequent debate and sharing of lists about top holders like MicroStrategy (now Strategy Inc.), Marathon Digital, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital. Users track these companies’ quarterly filings and press releases to stay updated on their Bitcoin reserves. How do companies acquire their Bitcoin reserves? Forum members highlight two main strategies: direct purchase on the open market and accumulation through mining (as seen with Marathon and Hut 8). Some companies also use dollar-cost averaging or allocate a portion of profits to steady Bitcoin accumulation How do corporate Bitcoin holdings affect the market? Many users speculate that large corporate purchases can drive price surges, reduce circulating supply, and influence retail investor sentiment. There’s also concern about centralization if too much Bitcoin is held by a few large entities. who holds the most Bitcoin overall in 2025? In 2025, Satoshi Nakamoto remains the largest Bitcoin holder with approximately 1.1 million BTC. He is followed by major institutional players like BlackRock, holding around 662,000 BTC, and Binance with about 611,000 BTC. Other significant holders include Fidelity, Grayscale, Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), and several national governments. Which new companies are jumping into Bitcoin this year? In 2025, several new companies are jumping into Bitcoin, including Davis Commodities , SolarBank , River Financial , Worksport , and Mercurity Fintech . Most of these firms are early-stage buyers , just beginning to build their BTC reserves.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/research-report/global-corporations-bitcoin-holdings-2025/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED","Research Report",cryptocompare

The new funding will expand the plan to build up Metaplanet’s BTC treasury. Metaplanet, one of the high-profile BTC treasury companies, announced a plan to aggressively capitalize its US-based subsidiary. The new capital injection of up to $5B will aim to expand Metaplanet’s BTC treasury model. The Japanese company announced the additional capitalization as part of its ‘555 million plan’. The funding will be allocated to the Florida-based Metaplanet Treasury Corp. *Notice of Additional Capital Contribution to U.S. Subsidiary* pic.twitter.com/5dWd5Y3s40 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 24, 2025 The expansion of the US subsidiary will allow the company to access markets with deeper liquidity. Currently, Metaplanet found sufficient BTC from Japanese exchanges, using the BitFlyer market. Recently, the company also bought BTC from the wallets of QCP Capital. Metaplanet is also one of the companies with a fully transparent treasury and known cold wallets. Corporate purchases rely on diminishing sources of BTC available through exchanges and OTC desks, and are considered the main factor for the creation of coin scarcity. On a weekly basis, corporate purchases often reach three times the amount of newly mined BTC. The company now holds 11,111 BTC, surpassing its previous plans of buying up to 10K BTC by the end of 2025. The ability to buy more BTC hinged on the rally of the Metaplanet stock price. In the past six months, the shares expanded by 1,250%, peaking at 1,895 JPY (around $13.05). Metaplanet saw one of the biggest rallies among BTC treasury companies, allowing it to accelerate the recent BTC purchases. | Source: Google Finance In the past weeks, Metaplanet has outperformed Strategy (MSTR) with a more relentless climb, allowing for the latest large purchases. However, Metaplanet has only 0.000018 BTC per share, a factor of 100 lower than Strategy. The Japanese company also started out at a later stage, with an average BTC purchase price of $95,869. After the latest BTC purchases, Metaplanet is climbing the ranks of treasury companies, which are becoming even more exclusive. In the past week, Metaplanet added another 1,111 BTC to its reserves, becoming the eight-largest holder and closing in on Tesla, Inc. The latest addition surpassed Strategy’s weekly purchase, which this time shrank to just 245 BTC . Metaplanet aims at an international market presence Metaplanet is making more aggressive moves, aiming for a global presence and a much higher BTC treasury. Currently, small-scale companies are also announcing BTC purchases, with some treasuries as low as 10 BTC. The Japanese company also boosted the Market Vector index of crypto companies, which has been on a non-stop expansion since the lows in April. The requirement for treasuries is now around 21 BTC to join the top 100 buyers. Metaplanet is competing with aggressive acquisitions, where the top 100 companies own 834,000 BTC. A position in the top 100 or top 10 may be more beneficial for stock prices, as well as the ability to further expand the BTC treasury. Metaplanet aims to position its US-listed subsidiary in a way that will give the company access to financing, as well as reputation and exposure. The company also aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. A treasury of this size would rival national governments and is one of the most ambitious plans. Other BTC treasury companies in the top 10 had more sporadic purchases and no clear plan of expansion, but Metaplanet aims to gain a similar reputation to Strategy.

2025-06-24T07:49:47,"Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025?","The post Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is entering a defining phase. After undergoing regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical shocks, and cycles of hype and despair. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to offer stability, the spotlight is gradually shifting toward new-generation projects with cutting-edge infrastructure and real-world utility. One name that stands out is “SUI”. Founded by former Meta engineers and launched in 2023, SUI has quickly made its presence felt not just for its price action but for its robust technical design. Now trading at $2.85, up over 246% in one year, SUI is poised for a major breakout in the evolving Web3 narrative. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Reliable Safe Havens? In turbulent markets, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to serve as financial bedrocks in the crypto market. As global tensions rise, like the recent military escalations between global powers, investors often seek refuge in these legacy assets. BTC’s finite supply and ETH’s growing utility in DeFi, NFTs, and staking protocols reaffirm their place as long-term value stores. With institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK continuing to expand Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF exposure, the floor for these assets is more solid than ever. Although they may not deliver 10x returns, they are likely to provide relative stability and respectable gains as the broader market matures. Why SUI Could Be 2025’s Breakout Star SUI isn’t just another Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed with scalability, security, and developer flexibility at its core. Using a unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language, it addresses many of the vulnerabilities seen in legacy blockchains. This innovation allows it to support high throughput and low latency, perfect for mass adoption. Launched at $1.4, SUI hit a high of $5.35 within 18 months, solidifying its place among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its daily trading volume has surged by 49.83%, and the RSI indicator, currently at 48.4, suggests a possible bullish reversal as it bounces from the mid-range. Successively, if all goes well, SUI price could eye the $7 mark in 2025. Adding further bullish momentum is NASDAQ’s 21Shares ETF filing for SUI, a move that could drive institutional capital into the ecosystem. While SUI is still young and may face stiff competition from older Layer-1 chains, its growth trajectory, innovation, and institutional signals make it a crypto to watch, and potentially one that could boom in 2025. Curious about Sui’s long-term target? Read our Sui Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is SUI a risky investment in 2025? It carries risks, but its rapid growth, strong fundamentals and adoption reduce uncertainty. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum still be good investments in 2025? Yes, they will remain reliable choices, especially for conservative investors seeking stability. Why is SUI getting ETF interest so early?

2025-06-24T07:38:38,"Crypto Regulations In China 2025","The post Crypto Regulations In China 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News China was among the earliest countries to enthusiastically embrace cryptocurrency. The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties. Previous major crypto regulations in China– Date Law/ Regulation Details September 24, 2021 Crypto trading, mining, and transactions ban Effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin June 2021 Ban on crypto mining Concerns regarding cryptocurrency January 2018 Crackdown on cryptocurrencies Miners shifted operations overseas September 30, 2017 ICO ban ICO, crypto exchanges, trading cease April 1, 2014 Closure of Bitcoin trading PBOC ordered to close bitcoin trading accounts December 5, 2013 Banking restrictions Banks/ payments institutions banned from bitcoin transactions June 2009 Prohibition of virtual currencies To prevent purchasing real-world goods What is the Chinese Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country’s own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China’s regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China’s strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It’s highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-china-in-2024/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

The Japanese hotel company set up its Florida-based subsidiary on May 1, aimed at expanding its global bitcoin treasury operations. The contribution is expected to significantly accelerate the implementation of its “555 million plan,” disclosed earlier on June 6, the company said in a statement . Metaplanet’s strategic objective is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, leveraging the deep capital markets and advanced institutional infrastructure in the U.S. to optimize acquisition and management processes. This U.S. expansion aligns with the company’s broader vision to establish a globally integrated treasury model that supports shareholder value, improves treasury yield efficiency and strengthens its leadership in bitcoin capital markets. The funding for this contribution will come from exercising the 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition rights, and all proceeds will be directed toward additional bitcoin purchases. Importantly, there is no change to the previously disclosed intended use of funds. The financial impact on the company’s current fiscal year results is expected to be minimal, but Metaplanet has committed to promptly disclosing any material developments. Shares of the Tokyo-listed Metaplanet, the eighth largest corporate holder of bitcoin with 11,111 BTC, closed 7% lower on Tuesday.

2025-06-24T07:30:11,"Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here’s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow","Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications So far, investors are already looking positively toward July 2025, as there have been rumors of a rate cut. This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November.

2025-06-24T07:26:02,"Schiff introduces the COIN Act to bar the president from crypto","U.S. Senator for California Adam Schiff introduced a bill on Monday titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act. The legislation would bar the president, vice president, and their immediate family members from engaging in crypto-related business ventures while holding office. The bill comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the case of President Donald Trump’s recent involvement in crypto. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Schiff introduces the COIN Act Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 The new legislation mandates that officials disclose any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. According to the bill, violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff also linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings, saying they have raised significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of presidency to enrich himself and his family. Trump and his family have doubled down on their footprint in the crypto space, as his administration has pushed to create a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, including through legislation. “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” – Adam Schiff , U.S. Senator for California. The senator’s proposal also raised eyebrows since he just voted last week in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. Schiff acknowledged in a video posted Monday that Trump’s stablecoin venture was a central piece of the graft going on in the White House. The legislation restricts members of Congress and some executive officials from issuing stablecoins but exempts the president and vice president. Democrats had initially threatened to walk away from the bill at the Republicans’ refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. Due to pressure to push the legislation through, the U.S. officials finally relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, and it passed on June 19. According to the proposal, nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the stablecoin legislation. Democrats propose other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures Democrats have also proposed other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures, including the MEME Act, introduced by Sam Liccardo in the House and Senator Chris Murphy. Representative Maxine Waters also introduced the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none of the legislations are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Last year, Trump and his sons launched a crypto project, World Liberty Financial, which has since released a stablecoin. According to a recent financial disclosure, the President has garnered around $58 million from the venture. That total is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his memecoin launched in January. Trump launched his memecoin (TRUMP) shortly after his inauguration and held a dinner with the top investors last month. His wife, Melania Trump, also launched her memecoin ( MELANIA ) days after Trump launched his token. The President’s involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. In May, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also opened an investigation into Trump’s crypto businesses. Blumenthal revealed that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations would be opening a preliminary inquiry into the launch of the President’s cryptocurrency, along with DeFi platform WLFI and other digital asset interests. Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has raised $2.5 billion to create a Bitcoin reserve and has advanced towards launching several crypto-related financial assets. The SEC approved the filing on June 13, which covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

2025-06-24T07:17:40,"Texas passes SB1498 allowing seizure of digital assets tied to crimes","Texas has passed a law granting law enforcement the authority to seize digital assets, with the measure set to take effect on Sept. 1. On June 20, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1498 , a bipartisan law that gives law enforcement the power to seize digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), NFTs, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrency tied to criminal activity. The bill received full approval and is set to take effect on Sept. 1. Under the new law, digital assets can be seized if they were used in or gained from crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud, theft, organized crime, or human trafficking. Any increase in the value of the seized assets between the time it was obtained and the time it is seized can also be claimed by the state. Law enforcement would be required to move any seized assets tied to these crimes into a secure, offline wallet that can only be accessed by the agency or the state’s attorney. The forfeiture case would be filed in the county where the seizing agency is based.

Lawmakers said SB1498 addresses gaps in current law and is needed as digital assets increasingly play a role in financial crimes. Meanwhile, Arizona is also updating its laws to expand the state’s forfeiture laws to include digital assets. SB1498 arrives alongside SB21, signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott on June 22, making Texas the first state to allocate public funds and create a dedicated framework specifically for holding Bitcoin. Managed separately from the general treasury, the reserve aims to strengthen the state’s financial resilience and serve as a hedge against inflation. Additionally, Texas has become the third state in the US to pass a Bitcoin reserve law, following Arizona and New Hampshire .

Institutional investors poured $1.24B into crypto funds this week, marking ten straight weeks of inflows. With inflation fears cooling and macro conditions stabilizing, crypto appears poised for sustained growth. The cryptocurrency market has staged a recovery after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “complete and total” ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The move, which de-escalates the Israel-Iran conflict, sparked a surge in risk appetite among investors, sending Bitcoin 3% higher to reclaim the key $105,000 level. The market-wide rally began late Monday after President Trump’s announcement on Truth Social was followed by confirmations from senior Iranian officials, according to Reuters . The de-escalation caused a sharp reversal from the risk-off sentiment that had gripped markets. Ceasefire Sparks Broad Market Rally Markets responded swiftly and decisively.

Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, allowing the state to set aside $10 million to buy Bitcoin. Unlike other states that have shown interest in digital assets, Texas is proving its commitment by putting real money on the line. Lone Star State becomes the first in the U.S. to officially fund a Bitcoin treasury $10M Bitcoin Bet Is Now Official The newly signed law directs the state to build a Bitcoin reserve that will be managed independently from the state’s main treasury. The Texas Bitcoin reserve will be managed by the state comptroller with guidance from a three-member crypto advisory committee. Along with direct purchases, the fund may grow through forks, airdrops, profits, or public donations. A detailed public report will be released every two years. This makes Texas stand out from states like Arizona and New Hampshire , which approved similar legislation but never actually funded their crypto reserves. The $10 million may sound small for a state the size of Texas, it’s just 0.0004% of the overall state budget, but crypto experts say it’s a big step forward. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, says this sends a powerful signal that Texas is ready to lead in the future of finance. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold that only Bitcoin currently has. Bitcoin Reserve Gets Extra Legal Protection Alongside Senate Bill 21, Governor Abbott also signed HB 4488. This bill makes sure that the Bitcoin held by the state isn’t accidentally swept into the general budget during financial reshuffling. In other words, Texas wants to keep its Bitcoin stash safe and untouched. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits , This move comes as the Trump administration works on building a national crypto reserve, though the federal version plans to rely on crypto seizures or bond issuance instead of direct funding. Texas, however, is making its crypto ambitions crystal clear. Bitcoin isn’t just a speculative asset anymore, and with more support from US states, it’s part of the state’s financial future. The move could spark interest from other states looking to modernize their treasury strategies. For now, Texas is the first to step up and put Bitcoin on the books, literally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Texas aims to position itself as a crypto-forward state and hedge against fiat currency risks. With Senate Bill 21, the state officially allocated $10M to Bitcoin as a signal of long-term confidence in digital assets and financial innovation. Could Texas start accepting Bitcoin for taxes or state services? Not yet, but this move lays the foundation for such innovations in the future. If this reserve performs well and the legal framework strengthens, Bitcoin payments could become a viable option How does the Texas Bitcoin reserve differ from similar proposals in Arizona and New Hampshire? Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed laws but didn’t allocate actual funds, Texas has put $10 million into its reserve. This shows real financial commitment, making Texas the first state to officially fund and manage a crypto treasury. What’s HB 4488, and how does it protect the Bitcoin reserve? HB 4488 ensures that Texas’s Bitcoin reserve stays separate from the general state budget. It protects against budget reshuffling, ensuring Bitcoin isn’t sold or moved unless explicitly approved.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/texas-bitcoin-reserve-strategy-becomes-reality-with-10m-investment/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T07:15:31,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction For June 25","After a sharp rebound from the $100,000 region, the Bitcoin price today is trading near $105,400 as bulls attempt to regain control. The recovery follows a high-volume bounce from major demand zones, with momentum indicators pointing toward a potential short-term continuation. However, the price remains capped below a critical resistance band, creating a tight range heading into June 25. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin price action on the daily chart shows BTC moving within a medium-term ascending pitchfork. After breaking below mid-channel support earlier this week, bulls stepped in aggressively at the lower bounds near $100K. This level also aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement zone and prior breakout support. The daily structure remains fragile, as price is now approaching key resistance levels between $106,000 and $108,000. This area overlaps with a Fibonacci pivot and prior rejection zone. Meanwhile, upside targets are visible at $109,150 and $114,890, both significant Fibonacci and pivot cluster zones. On the downside, $102,000 and $100,000 form crucial intraday support levels.

2025-06-24T07:12:08,"Santiment Warns About Five Altcoins! “Pay Attention to Prices, Whales Are on the Move!","Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins have experienced sharp declines amid tensions between the US, Iran and Israel. While the BTC price fell to $98,000, ETH and altcoins also experienced significant declines. However, after the news that Iran and Israel reached an agreement, BTC and altcoins turned green, while Santiment issued a volatility warning for some altcoins. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment announced the four altcoins that whales transferred the most to exchanges. Accordingly, Santiment said that significant transfers to exchanges were seen in five altcoins. These include PAX Gold (PAXG), Space ID (ID), Gala (GALA), Aethir (ATH), and Pendle (PENDLE). “PAX Gold, Space ID, Gala, Aethir, and Pendle are among the altcoins that have seen whale transfers of over $1 million to centralized exchanges. Be prepared for volatility, especially when high percentages of a coin’s supply are transferred to a CEX.” Such large altcoin inflows to exchanges are generally interpreted as preparations for sales. It usually signals potential selling pressure and increased volatility, as whales may be preparing to unload their positions. Therefore, whale transfers can increase short-term volatility for these altcoins and affect price action. At this point, investors should also monitor PAX Gold, Space ID, GALA, ATH, and PENDLE, as increased exchange transfers could signal increased selling pressure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T07:05:00,"These 5 Coins Will Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Delivering 15,000% Returns by Market Peak in 2026","June 2025 — Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the twin pillars of the crypto ecosystem, but their scale now limits the kind of exponential returns seen in previous cycles. While they continue to lead institutional adoption and ecosystem development, many investors are eyeing a new wave of high-upside tokens with the potential to 15x, 150x—even 15000%—by the 2026 peak. In this list, we spotlight five standout altcoins—led by Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and including Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui—that are positioned to outperform BTC and ETH over the next 18 months vastly. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Utility at Layer-2 Speed Little Pepe isn’t just a meme—it’s infrastructure for the meme economy. Unlike viral coins scrambling to add utility after launch, LILPEPE was designed as a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme tokens from the outset. Its standout features include sniper bot immunity, zero tax on transactions, and a native token launchpad ( Pepe’s Pump Pad ) that lets anyone deploy a secure meme token with locked liquidity and pre-audited contracts. The presale, now in Stage 3, is experiencing a surge. With more than 67% of tokens sold at the current tier and prices rising incrementally per stage, investors are rushing in before major centralized exchange (CEX) listings go live. Backed by meme veterans with a track record of launching viral tokens, Little Pepe’s roadmap includes: A launch on Uniswap and two major centralized exchanges A $1 billion market cap target A top-100 CEX’s push by year’s end By combining technical innovation with meme-driven virality, LILPEPE could easily outperform traditional tokens. Its current low market entry point could result in four—to five-digit percentage returns in the coming cycle. Solana (SOL): Still a Contender, Despite a Summer Lull Solana has faced headwinds recently. Following a double-digit drop over the past month, trading volumes have also slid by over 16% in the last 24 hours alone. Investor confidence has waned, with price movement stagnating in a tight, sideways range that many view as a symbol of broader altcoin fatigue. However, history shows that Solana’s quiet periods often precede periods of aggressive growth. In past cycles, periods of low volatility and declining interest created accumulation zones that set up multi-month bull runs. The key lies in Solana’s underlying fundamentals: fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a massive NFT and DeFi ecosystem that remains unmatched among L1 competitors. While the $200 mark for Solana seems unattainable, once the network activity picks up and the market climate improves, Solana can recover some of the lost ground. Analysts say breakout potential remains within reach as innovations continue and on-chain activities pick up. Due to its solid developer community and growing institutional appeal, Solana remains a high-beta wager with massive growth potential, especially for those who buy in during consolidation periods. Dogecoin (DOGE): Compression Before Explosion? Dogecoin nears breakout as symmetrical triangle tightens, signaling potential major move ahead. Recently, the coin has been tested for its support and resistance levels multiple times. Price recovery attempts have been met with sell pressure, but support has remained firm, indicating accumulation beneath the surface. Analysts suggest that the current pattern could resolve with a 60% move in either direction, with macroeconomic developments—such as Federal Reserve announcements—acting as a likely trigger. Though the breakout direction isn’t guaranteed, the setup is hard to ignore. With Elon Musk’s continued support and DOGE’s integration into several mainstream platforms, even a moderate rally could reignite speculative interest. In a euphoric market, DOGE could once again set its sights on the elusive $1 mark, making now a strategic moment for entry. Cardano (ADA): ETF Approval Bets Fuel Institutional Interest Cardano’s price has been under pressure, weighed down by recent market sell-offs and whale liquidations. Yet underneath the bearish surface lies one of the most powerful potential catalysts of the next 12 months: ETF approval odds hitting all-time highs. Analysts at Bloomberg now assign a 79% probability to a spot Cardano ETF being approved in the U.S.—a significant shift from earlier this year, when odds hovered below 70%. The SEC’s interactions with big asset managers and new interest from crypto institutions fuel this newfound excitement. While some whales have let go of their holdings throughout this recent turbulent period, on-chain data shows that mid-tier investors continue to buy, demonstrating conviction that growth will occur over time and that inflows triggered by ETFs will add fuel to the fire. Although ADA is not exhibiting significant price action, factors such as fundamentals, regulatory tailwinds, and the level of developer engagement suggest the possibility of a multi-phase recovery rally when risk appetite returns. Should the ETF case play out in 2025, Cardano could undergo a drastic pivot, offering rewards that surpass those of other slow-moving assets. Sui (SUI): Oversold but Structurally Promising Sui has been under intense selling pressure in both spot and derivatives markets. Open Interest has cratered by over 40% since late May, while taker sell volume outpaces buys by a wide margin, highlighting weak sentiment and capital flight from leveraged positions. Yet, this capitulation phase might be exactly what SUI needs. The RSI indicates a bullish divergence scenario, as the price forms higher lows while testing support. MACD flattening hints downtrend is weakening; SUI eyes reversal if $3 resistance gets tested. A break of that resistance could lead to recovery toward monthly highs and possibly reestablish momentum toward all-time levels. Given its strong infrastructure backing and developer interest, a turnaround here could signal the beginning of a larger move. For contrarian investors, SUI may offer one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the current altcoin landscape. Final Word: Don’t Just Watch Bitcoin—Beat It Real 2026 gains lie in undervalued, high-utility altcoins with momentum. Little Pepe leads this list as the most explosive narrative play of the year, while Solana, DOGE, Cardano, and Sui offer fundamentally solid setups with technical breakout potential. In a cycle where infrastructure meets meme culture and regulation meets DeFi, this is the moment to look beyond the giants—and position yourself before the wave hits.

2025-06-24T07:04:29,"Crypto Analyst Unveils ‘Biggest Area’ of Accumulation for Bitcoin, Says BTC Going Much Higher in Coming Years","An analyst known for calling the November 2021 crypto bull cycle top says he’s looking to heavily accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ) if it drops below $100,000. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 867,700 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Bitcoin, and he thinks dips below the six-figure price level are golden opportunities to stack more BTC. “I bought 25 BTC to start to scale in. Spot, of course. But I think the biggest area I want to buy is around $94,000 if given, where I would go pretty heavy. I think in the next few years we are going much, much higher regardless. In the short term, it’s hard to say. The chart looks not ideal. I see that area as current value, however. Of course, I was hoping for us to see $120,000+ at the recent highs. It just didn’t happen. We don’t always get what we want.” Source: Pentoshi/X While the trader thinks that Bitcoin will soar over a long arc of time, he points out that macro uncertainties and geopolitical tensions could drive BTC to lower levels in the short term. “I don’t suggest following me into this at all, there’s a TON of uncertainty. And we likely do go lower. My time frames likely differ from yours. I mostly focus on broader, higher time frames than the minute-to-minute stuff. I would say odds are higher we do go lower for those looking to actually knife catch.” As for the catalyst that will fuel Bitcoin’s ascent in the coming years, Pentoshi says the debasement of the US dollar will drive people to dump their fiat currency in favor of BTC.

2025-06-24T07:00:30,"$589 XRP Coded Price Target: This Seems Coded In Bitcoin Before XRP: Details","In a recent tweet accompanied by a video, crypto commentator NotFinancialAdvice presented a theory suggesting that the number 589 (believed to be the potential XRP price) may have been intentionally embedded in Bitcoin’s history before being popularly associated with XRP. The tweet reads , “Was 589 coded into Bitcoin before XRP?!” and expands into a detailed commentary connecting dates, crypto protocols, and regulatory events. The creator refers to a specific image from a CNBC segment, where a $100 bill showing the serial number ending in “589” appears beneath a Bitcoin, calling it “one of the craziest 589s hidden in plain sight” and labeling the moment as intentional rather than coincidental. He credits the find to the account XRPdrops but says the implications go beyond XRP. In the video, he questions why the number 589 appears beneath a Bitcoin instead of XRP in the visual and suggests that the alignment between Bitcoin and XRP could point to a shared design or broader coordinated vision. According to the creator, “that was intentional,” and he adds, “that is an impossible coincidence.” Was 589 coded into Bitcoin before XRP?! pic.twitter.com/VvjvRb1nV7 — NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) June 23, 2025 Proposed Complementarity Between Bitcoin and XRP The video further expands on the theory by suggesting that Bitcoin and XRP may have complementary roles within a broader monetary architecture. The creator references Bitcoin’s proof-of-work design, claiming it creates “real value” through energy expenditure, while XRP’s green consensus protocol could serve as the mechanism to transmit that value efficiently. He also compares the respective branding aesthetics, proposing that the colors of the Bitcoin and Ripple logos were chosen to reflect ionized liquid gold and silver. In his interpretation, Bitcoin represents a gold-like store of value, and XRP represents a silver-like utility in payments. He also asserts that these characteristics shared a purposeful link, stating that both cryptocurrencies might have originated from the same ideological or even organizational source. He implies that this origin has not been made public but can be deduced through symbolic and factual alignment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Dates and the “589” Connection The video goes further by highlighting specific dates and timelines. One of the central observations is that the first time the Bitcoin source code was publicly posted on a forum was on May 8, 2009—numerically represented as 5/8/09. He argues that this date not only fits the now-famous 589 motif but may have been deliberately chosen. The theory becomes more intricate as he links this date to an SEC file released the same day—SEC release number 34-59895. He states that this document established a legal and structural framework that would eventually support the approval of digital asset products, including Bitcoin ETFs. In another connection, the commentator notes that Brad Garlinghouse was named CEO of Ripple five years, eight months, and nine days after Satoshi Nakamoto sent his final known email on April 23, 2011. He considers this timing to be more than coincidental and potentially indicative of a larger orchestrated effort behind the scenes. According to NotFinancialAdvice, these time-based and numerical correlations are not isolated phenomena. He believes they indicate that the concept of 589 may have been embedded into the crypto space from the beginning, possibly by a group of cryptographers who designed both Bitcoin and XRP as part of a coordinated, long-term vision. He emphasizes that if these connections are intentional, they demonstrate how early decisions shaped the regulatory and technological environment in which cryptocurrencies now operate.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many altcoins dropped sharply, with traders rushing to sell as global markets remained closed. However, most of the market has recovered since then. Bitcoin is now back above $105,000, Ethereum has rebounded over $2,400, and several top altcoins like XRP have also bounced strongly. According to an analyst, several altcoins are showing strength and this could be a good time to slowly start accumulating promising projects for the long term.

2025-06-24T06:48:14,"$4B Hong Kong Family Office Enters Crypto — How Big is the Bet?","VMS Group, a Hong Kong multifamily offices with deep roots in private equity, is making its first push into digital assets as clearer regulations and institutional momentum pull traditional investors into the crypto space. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the firm, which manages nearly $4b for some of the city’s wealthiest families, plans to allocate up to $10m to Re7 Capital, a London-based hedge fund focused on decentralized finance strategies. VMS managing partner Elton Cheung said the move reflects a shift in how the firm approaches liquidity and diversification. Founded two decades ago, the Hong Kong firm has historically focused on private equity and long-term bets across sectors such as property, pharmaceuticals and technology. But with companies staying private longer and exits becoming harder to time, the firm is now leaning into more liquid strategies, including digital assets. VMS Chooses Hedged Approach to Crypto Over Direct Token Holdings “We thought this was the right time because of growing demand and because we see clearer legislative and government support from various jurisdictions, as well as large institutional support and endorsement,” Cheung told Bloomberg. He did not disclose specific clients. Instead of buying volatile tokens like Bitcoin , VMS chose to work with Re7, which offers a market-neutral strategy. The fund earns yield by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges and lending stablecoins, while hedging to reduce price swings. That approach aligns more closely with the risk frameworks of legacy family offices that are seeking exposure without speculative downside. “The reason investors keep coming back to crypto is the asymmetry of risk and return,” said Re7 founder Evgeny Gokhberg. “Typically, people think about asymmetry in crypto as ‘lose it all or make a 100x.’ That’s rarely a fit for a serious allocator with a reputation to lose.” Re7, founded in 2021, claims to have consistently delivered double-digit returns, though it did not disclose exact figures. Next-Gen Wealth Influences Hong Kong Family Office’s Shift Toward Broader Digital Asset Adoption VMS’ crypto strategy goes beyond hedge fund exposure. Zhi Li, who joined the firm in December to lead digital asset investments from London, said the team is studying broader applications, including blockchain payments and infrastructure. One current area of interest is integrating crypto-based transactions at a real estate development the firm operates in Vietnam. “There is very strong institutional and family interest in getting regulated digital asset exposure,” said Li. “We have seen the younger generation of families wanting to do something different.” As family offices evolve to serve new wealth dynamics and generational preferences, VMS’s entry into crypto reflects a broader shift. Once reluctant, legacy capital is now stepping into digital assets, not for hype, but for structure, yield and strategic positioning.

2025-06-24T06:46:49,"Israeli man arrested for acting as an Iranian spy in exchange for cryptocurrency","A 27-year old Tel Aviv resident was recently arrested by police for allegedly spying on Israeli public officials for Iran. He was reportedly paid thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for his efforts. According to a recent news reports by i24 and Arutz Sheva, Israeli authorities claimed that the suspect, a man named Or Beilin, was paid thousands of dollars in crypto to conduct espionage on Israeli public officials and political activities. Following his handler’s instructions, the Israeli man was assigned to spy on public officials by taking photographs of their homes in secret, documenting government military installations and report on political spray-painted graffiti. The 27-year-old was arrested on June 24 by the Israeli police and the Shin Bet security service. The police raided his home and seized the culprit’s computer and other digital equipment used to receive crypto payments and communicate with Iranian contacts. He has been temporarily detained under suspicion as authorities continue to carry out more investigations into the matter. According to the report , the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court has extended his detention until June 26 as the investigation continues.

The police urged residents to report any suspicious recruitment from foreign actors. Most recently, the police have arrested two other Israeli citizens were also arrested for similar espionage activities. One of them is 28-year-old Dmitri Cohen, who is accused of gathering intelligence on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son’s fiancée.

Despite alarming headlines, equities like the S&P and NASDAQ are climbing, oil prices are falling, and crypto sentiment is far from collapsing. Moreover, President Trump’s peace-leaning X post has added calm to the chaos. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst VirtualBacon offers a refreshing perspective: “This is not a time to sell in fear, but a time to buy with conviction”. Intriguing enough? let’s dive into the analysis for more details. Bitcoin Holds Steady in Bullish Territory? The analyst highlights that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish above $85k, supported by its 50-week SMA. With the ideal entry between $94k and $95k, aligned with the 20-week SMA, he believes that the market weakness here is viewed as a gift, not a threat. A potential double-top pattern is forming, and if the neckline breaks, it could deliver the long-awaited entry point. It is worth noting that the on-chain metrics show neutral sentiment, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 47, indicating indecision rather than panic. With BTC dominance at 64.5%, the flagship crypto continues to command the broader market. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Must Buy Altcoins During the Dip Ethereum recently touched $2,100, precisely where the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement lands. With ETH/BTC holding firm above 0.018, Ethereum remains in a macro uptrend. Analyst suggest this is a favorable range to begin scaling in, especially if the BTC price remains above $90k. Successively, Solana is slightly weaker, but its $110–$120 zone is widely regarded as a value area. He mentions that, the failed inverse head & shoulders pattern doesn’t invalidate the setup unless SOL/BTC collapses. Meanwhile, XRP is nearing its prime entry zone between $1.74–$1.80. However, caution remains as traders await confirmation of a potential 3x move. Also read our Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! VirtualBacon highlights that TAO, a leader in the AI sector, is resilient. If BTC dips to $95k, TAO may offer a $200 entry opportunity with a $175 stop-loss. Meme coin PEPE is retesting its neckline at $0.009 after holding 15-month support at $0.005. With clean structure and growing volume, it remains a top pick among high-risk traders. FAQs Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Yes, $94k–$95k is seen as a strong re-entry zone if the short-term pattern confirms. Which altcoins look most attractive now? Ethereum and Solana show favorable technicals, with ETH holding macro strength. What’s the market mood right now? Neutral. The Fear & Greed Index is 47, and despite war headlines, crypto cap is up 4.26%.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-5-altcoins-to-buy-right-now-for-2x-profits-soon/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T06:30:36,"Historic Ripple Image Suggests XRP is the “Final Product” of Bitcoin Beta Test","Crypto influencer Amelie posted a tweet drawing attention to an old promotional image of Ripple from its early development phase. The tweet, captioned “WOW! ‘RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.’ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT. HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH,” was accompanied by a photo of an early Ripple conference booth. In the image, a banner describes Ripple as “the world’s first open payment network” and highlights features such as distributed exchanges, cross-currency payments, and liquidity improvements. One of the key takeaways from the banner is the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners,” which Amelie used as a central element in her statement. The image likely dates back to Ripple’s earliest promotional stages, when the team was presenting its vision to the broader blockchain and developer community. It prominently features Arthur Britto and David Schwartz’s early positioning of Ripple as a technologically advanced alternative to Bitcoin’s initial shortcomings in payment scalability and interoperability. WOW! „RIPPLE BUILT BY BITCOINERS.“ BTC = BETA TEST COIN #XRP = FINAL PRODUCT HATE IT OR LOVE IT BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH. pic.twitter.com/JH44HBzUhI — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 22, 2025 Context Behind “Built by Bitcoiners” Amelie’s use of the phrase “Built by Bitcoiners” points to the historical reality that some of Ripple’s early contributors had been involved in Bitcoin or had studied its limitations closely. Ripple’s creators sought to improve on what they considered inefficiencies in Bitcoin’s architecture, especially around transaction throughput, energy consumption, and lack of native support for multiple currencies. Ripple’s consensus protocol, which differs significantly from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work model , was introduced to address these issues directly. The tweet suggests that Bitcoin functioned as a “beta test,” while XRP represents a more refined, scalable iteration. This perspective is controversial, but Amelie presents it as a factual progression rather than a speculative opinion. The tone of her message is definitive, asserting XRP’s role as the superior technological evolution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions to the Tweet Amelie’s tweet received responses from other users on the X platform. One user, posting under the handle Crypto, reacted with a rhetorical question: “Is the failure worth 100,000 dollars? Ha ha ha,” seemingly mocking Bitcoin’s high valuation in the context of its limitations. Another user named James echoed Amelie’s position, stating , “I agree XRP is the better vision of Bitcoin.” These replies reflect contrasting interpretations of Bitcoin’s value proposition relative to XRP’s utility and network design. Significance of the Image in the Broader XRP Narrative The promotional image shared in Amelie’s tweet serves as a reminder of Ripple’s original messaging strategy and technological goals. Descriptions on the banner, such as “More Merchants,” “Increased Liquidity & Utility,” and “Shared Principles, Shared Dream” reflect the ambition to build a more adaptable and enterprise-friendly system than Bitcoin. The visual reinforcement of Ripple’s origins and ethos, alongside Amelie’s labeling of Bitcoin as a prototype, adds context to the longstanding debate about which blockchain projects are best suited for institutional and cross-border applications . The image and accompanying statement also illustrate how the early Ripple team sought legitimacy by building on Bitcoin’s foundation while simultaneously identifying areas for improvement.

2025-06-24T06:30:18,"Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins?","The post Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Up Today—Is This a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin & Other Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising after the conflict between Iran & Israel approached a ceasefire situation. Bitcoin price surged from the lows below $100K and marked a daily high above $106K, which elevated the market capitalization above $3.24 trillion. With this, the market sentiments also surged from fear to neutral, signaling the growing confidence among the market participants. Top Cryptos Recover After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement As the war situation escalated, Bitcoin and the other cryptos faced a huge sell-off with the uncertainty hovering over the markets. The global financial markets also faced the heat, but soon after US President Trump announced a ceasefire between the nations, the markets recovered. In a blog post on Truth Social, Trump announced that Iran and Israel have agreed to a full ceasefire, potentially ending the ‘12-day war. With this, top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and a few more rebounded, while several other categories also reacted positively. Meanwhile, the top gainers included SEI, which surged by more than 30% with a huge rise in volume of over 180%. On the other hand, the memecoins attracted double-digit gains; SPX6900 surged by over 30%, followed by Mog Coin by over 26%, Brett by over 20%, and dogwifhat by over 22%. Meanwhile, the top memecoins, Dogecoin & Shiba Inu, are also preparing for a strong rebound that may elevate the levels within the bullish pattern. AI, RWA & DePIN Space Also Thrive The AI space has gained immense attention in recent times, with the tokens outperforming the top cadre tokens. However, the trader’s interest focused back on the top tokens, which kept the AI tokens under tight consolidation. Bittensor price surged by over 16%, followed by Render by over 15% and Livepeer & Theta Network by over 12% each. On the other hand, the crypto ETFs also saw a positive netflow, as the institutions accumulated over $327 million worth of BTC and over $100.7 million worth of Ethereum. Meanwhile, the Open interest continues to descend, suggesting the traders are opting out of their positions, which does not support the bullish narrative. Will the Crypto Market Continue to Rise? The crypto market has experienced notable relief driven by external factors; however, the significant sell-off was also caused by a similar factor. This suggests the markets have risen above the pure demand and supply tactics and have a huge influence on the goings-on in the outside world. Hence, any further escalation or any announcement may increase the uncertainty, which may further result in a fresh breakdown. Hence, the market participants are expected to remain highly vigilant about the upcoming price action.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-why-the-crypto-market-is-up-today-is-this-a-bullish-signal-for-bitcoin-other-altcoins/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MOG","Price Analysis|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T06:26:44,"Democrats unveil COIN Act to block Trump and public officials from profiting off crypto","Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation that seeks to block U.S. public officials, including the President, from profiting off digital assets during and after their time in office. Dubbed the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure, or COIN, Act, the legislation came in response to concerns over President Donald Trump’s financial ties to cryptocurrency ventures. The bill was introduced by Senator Adam Schiff and co-sponsored by nine other Democratic lawmakers, following reports that Trump earned $57.4 million in 2024 through World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform linked to his family. Schiff said the president’s digital asset activities have raised serious ethical and constitutional concerns, pointing to what he described as Trump’s use of public office for personal financial gain. The COIN Act has been tailored to prevent what its sponsors call the “financial exploitation of digital assets” by elected officials and their immediate families. According to the text of the COIN Act, the legislation would prohibit current and former public officials, including the president, vice president, members of Congress, and high-ranking executive officials, from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets such as meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. This restriction would apply for 180 days prior to taking office and continue for two years after leaving office. Immediate family members would also be subject to the same rules. Further, the bill would amend the Ethics in Government Act to require digital assets to be included in financial disclosures and transaction reports. It also proposes codifying that holding or trading crypto qualifies as a financial interest under conflict of interest laws, requiring officials to recuse themselves from related decisions. Additionally, the legislation would require stablecoin issuers to certify quarterly that no public official is profiting from the issuance of their tokens in order to receive regulatory approval. You might also like: Crypto market rebounds as Trump announces potential Israel-Iran ceasefire A separate provision calls for the Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress within 360 days, offering recommendations on how to update federal ethics laws as crypto oversight frameworks develop. Pressure to introduce such guardrails has been building for months, driven largely by Democratic lawmakers alarmed by Trump’s expanding crypto portfolio. Earlier this year, Rep. Maxine Waters accused Trump of using his memecoin, $TRUMP, to enrich himself while defrauding investors. In April, Waters raised alarms over World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, warning that the token could become a tool for foreign actors to channel funds to the president. She has also condemned Trump’s private gala for top $TRUMP memecoin holders, calling it a “pay-to-play scheme” that blurred the line between campaign fundraising and political favour-trading. These concerns have already translated into multiple Democratic-led legislative efforts. Waters and other lawmakers have backed bills such as the MEME Act , led by Rep. Sam Liccardo, and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, both aimed at barring public officials and their families from owning or promoting digital assets while in office. Despite repeated objections, Trump has continued to expand his footprint in the digital asset sector. His family has backed multiple crypto ventures, including stablecoins and a reported stake in a Bitcoin mining project. Blockchain data has linked prominent crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , to large holdings of Trump-affiliated tokens.
