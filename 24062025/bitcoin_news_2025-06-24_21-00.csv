The outspoken real estate investor notes that Cardone Capital added approximately 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet. Cardone says the firm is the “first ever real estate/BTC company integrated with full BTC strategy, combining the two best-in-class assets.” He also says the firm plans to add another 3,000 BTC to its balance sheet this year. With BTC trading at $105,400 at time of writing, Cardone Capital’s 1,000 BTC investment is currently worth $105.4 million. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours. Cardone says the concept of saving money will just cause investors to lose purchasing power. “You can NOT save money! You either spend it, lose it or invest it. There is NO such thing as saving. Every US Dollar should come with ‘saver beware’ warning, ‘The purchasing power of this note will decline in purchasing value.'” Cardone Capital currently sports a portfolio of more than 14,200 units with a total value of $5.5 billion, per the firm’s LinkedIn account. The firm raises money from the public by launching equity funds available for retail traders. Cardone says the firm also plans to add 5,000 additional units this year.

2025-06-24T18:41:11,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tanev Says Retail Investors Unfazed by Middle East Tensions, Still Heavy in AI, Crypto, Fintech and More","The CEO of the world’s biggest retail trading platform says that everyday investors are doubling down on their bets despite tensions in the Middle East and other geopolitical uncertainty. In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says retail traders appear to be taking the recent uncertainty as an opportunity to continue buying the familiar names they had already accumulated in the past, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and crypto-related equities. “I was a little bit surprised that over the weekend, when all this was happening, the markets didn’t move so much in the overnight. I don’t know if you were surprised by that, but I feel like if this had happened a year or two years ago, we would have had a huge move, but markets were flat to even a little bit up. And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Besides the top ten biggest stocks, Tanev also says there’s been interest in stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), telehealth company Hims and Hers (HIMS), and oil futures. “There’s been a lot of interest in Circle (CRCL), I think that [Hims and Hers (HIMS)] had a big move yesterday – when you have a big move like that around news, you always have retail and institutional jumping in – so I wouldn’t say it’s just the top ten, there’s new things coming all the time, and now we have futures trading, so we did see some heightened activity around crude oil. But the futures traders have always been trading that, so I would say, broad-based equities and crypto, it’s pretty similar to how it was last week. High volumes, but no huge shifts as a result of the conflict.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-24T18:30:26,"Nano Labs Raises $500M in Debt Notes in $1B BNB Push","China-based Web 3.0 company Nano Labs has secured up to $500 million through a convertible notes deal with multiple investors. The funding kicks off a bigger plan to invest heavily in BNB, one of the top digital assets. This move follows a growing trend where crypto firms and Web 3 startups are increasing their holdings of digital currencies. Nano Labs’ $500M Convertible Notes Agreement On June 24, Nano Labs announced it would issue convertible promissory notes totaling $500 million. Several investors have already committed to buying these notes, which will not earn interest and mature 360 days after being issued. During that time, investors can convert their notes into the company’s Class A ordinary shares. The conversion price is reportedly set at $20 per share but may change as described in the agreement. If not converted, the full amount must be repaid at the end of the 360-day term. These notes are unsecured, meaning company assets do not back them. The agreement is still subject to standard closing conditions. Also, the transaction will not be completed in full. Investors are advised to take this into account when considering this update. Strategic Growth Through BNB Acquisition This agreement is more than just a funding move. It is part of Nano Labs’ larger plan to strengthen its presence in Web 3.0. A key part of this strategy is a deep dive into BNB, a major blockchain asset. Nano Labs, which began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2024, plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of BNB through convertible notes and private deals. The company eventually hopes to own 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. The company shared that a full security and value assessment of BNB will be carried out in the early stages of this plan. With this agreement, Nano Labs is signaling strong confidence in blockchain infrastructure and digital assets. The company believes this move will support its long-term goals and growth in the Web 3.0 ecosystem. A Broader Industry Trend Nano Labs’ plan to build a BNB treasury using convertible notes is not a one-off move. More companies across the crypto and tech space are starting to include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB in their business strategies. Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy is leading this trend. The company raised funds using several methods, including selling shares and issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Today, Strategy holds more Bitcoin than almost any other public company. Its strong market performance has caught the attention of other companies. Firms like Metaplanet, MARA, and not limited to Semler Scientific have also started adding Bitcoin to their financial reserves.

With over $10 million raised in pre-sale and surging demand from both retail and institutional investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a hidden gem—it’s a top contender for the next major breakout . The question now: Can Arbitrum (ARB) join this elite group? MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the pre-sale landscape with a structure and momentum rarely seen in 2025. Analysts are already projecting 75x–100x returns upon listing. This rare combination is steering capital away from traditional altcoins and into MAGACOIN FINANCE, positioning it firmly among the top gainers of the year , alongside Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. Scarcity-driven tokenomics with a tightly capped supply. Fully audited by HashEx, adding strong credibility. Explosive community growth , viral marketing, and disciplined rollout. Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP: Market Leaders Still Delivering Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, with 2025 targets between $180,000 and $250,000 , thanks to institutional inflows and ETF momentum. Solana continues gaining ground with a rapidly growing ecosystem and projections as high as $1,000 . Meanwhile, XRP benefits from strong legal positioning and ETF expectations, pushing analyst targets to as much as $19 . While these giants drive stability, their scale limits short-term upside, making emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE even more appealing. Is Arbitrum (ARB) Next? Arbitrum (ARB) is showing signs of revival, hovering between $0.37–$0.39 in June 2025. With upgraded Layer-2 solutions and renewed community interest, some forecasts suggest a rebound to $0.65–$2.76 by year-end. Still, ARB has yet to generate the explosive price movement seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Sustaining its recovery will be key to joining the 2025 outperformers. Conclusion With MAGACOIN FINANCE now standing among Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP in analysts’ top 2025 picks, the focus shifts to whether Arbitrum can catch up.

2025-06-24T18:30:00,"COIN Act: a new turn in the Democrats battle v Trump’s cryptocurrency business?","Sen. Adam Schiff from the Democratic Party introduced a new bill, the COIN Act, aimed at blocking U.S. Presidents and their families from promoting or launching cryptocurrency ventures. Why did Democrats come up with a new bill, and what is at stake for Donald Trump? Table of Contents The new act Burgeoning crypto empire of the Trumps Future of the COIN Act The new act The full name of the bill introduced by Adam Schiff is Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure Act. The new act is not explicitly aimed at ruining Trump’s cryptocurrency business. Rather, it bans all the sitting presidents, vice presidents, and their immediate family members (siblings, spouses, and children) from using their privileged position in the crypto space and other financial spaces. On top of cryptocurrencies, the act regulates (bans) endorsements and issuance of securities, commodities, and futures. The act bars top officials and their families from endorsing crypto projects and other assets and using the likeness of their names or images for the promotion of crypto ventures. The legislation is also blocking the issuance and sponsorship of assets. The COIN Act does not prohibit presidents and their families from purchasing, holding, and sending cryptocurrencies. Crypto assets held by senior officials are subject to disclosures just like other financial assets. Violators are penalized and are subjected to disgorgement of their illegal profit to the Treasury of the U.S. If the violation led to an aggregate loss of $1,000,000 or more to a citizen or several citizens of the U.S. or if the assets were used for bribery, violators can be subjected to criminal prosecution. Understandably, insider trading and fraud are also banned. Democrats have tried to push similar regulations before. In the spring of 2025, they tried to add clauses that would ban Trump from the crypto business to the Genius Act, regulating stablecoins. However, Democrats didn’t succeed in amending the bill. Seemingly, that was the reason for creating a new one, fully dedicated to the ties of the top officials with the business. Read more: Senate crypto bill collapses: Is partisan divide or Trump’s digital fortune to blame? Burgeoning crypto empire of the Trumps As Trump and his family are closely tied to several cryptocurrency projects, the COIN Act threatens their well-being. Adam Schiff makes it clear in a video he posted on X. Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 In the video, Schiff says that from Trump’s recent financial disclosure , we learned that the POTUS has gained substantial amounts of money from selling branded goods with this image or name on them (including the Trump-labeled Bible). However, Schiff continues, the most lucrative source of income for Trump and his family is the “cryptocurrency scheme.” One of the elements of this scheme is the Official Trump memecoin (the proceeds from this venture are not subjected to disclosures, as Trump launched the token before the inauguration). Another element of the scheme mentioned by Schiff is the stablecoin USD1 launched by World Liberty Finance, a company closely tied to Donald Trump and his sons, Donald and Eric. Through his involvement in World Liberty Finance, Donald Trump alone made $57 million in the first quarter of 2025. The COIN Act threatens these ventures, as its ban on involvement in the crypto business stretches from 180 days pre-term to two years following the end of the term. It would make proceedings from memecoins Official Trump and Melania illegal, as well as the Trump family’s involvement in World Liberty Finance. In January 2025, Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company behind Truth Social, announced it would allocate $250 million in cryptocurrencies through a new platform Truth.Fi. Eric Trump is the chief strategic officer of the new mining venture American Bitcoin. In May, the company announced it was going public . 98% of the company belongs to Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Future of the COIN Act Schiff supported the GENIUS Act despite the fact that the restrictions for crypto businesses for senior officials were omitted from the bill. Generally, it shows that Schiff is not going to serve as a hurdle for crypto innovation in the U.S., while he is still concerned about eye-popping Trump’s conflict of interest. As of the press time, the COIN Act has the support of nine Senate Democrats. It is too early to judge if the proposal will see success. Previously, Republicans showed no interest in limiting Trump’s involvement in the crypto business, so the COIN Act may be rejected just like the amendments to the GENIUS Act that were denied before. However, time will show if this defining bill will become the rule.

Trump posted the peace claims on Truth Social after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Prediction market Polymarket registered a 99% likelihood of a ceasefire shortly after the announcement. Polymarket is in talks to raise $200 million at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. Bitcoin price has recovered to the $105,000 level today, after the truce announcement made by U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin briefly reached $106,000 before the price seemingly stabilized at the current stage. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,064. Bitcoin Hits $105K After Trump Announces Israel-Iran Ceasefire “Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!’ I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures,” stated Trump on social media. “They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE,” he wrote. ""CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE…"" –President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/hLTBT34KnG — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 23, 2025 The ceasefire came after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar. The retaliation has not caused substantial damage or casualties. Since Trump announced the ceasefire, Israel has accused Iran of initiating another round of attacks. Iran denied the claimed attack. “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave’ to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!” wrote Trump. On the cryptocurrency-based prediction site Polymarket , the possibility of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has jumped to 99% from the previous 8% on June 23. The chance of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal remains fluctuating with a current Polymarket possibility of 44%. “IRAN WILL NEVER REBUILD THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES!” said Trump. Polymarket Users Bet on Peace as Platform Eyes $200M Raise According to The Information , Polymarket is in talks to raise $200 million in the latest round of funding with a valuation of over $1 billion. The decentralized platform raised $70 million from two recent rounds in May, including a Series A of $20 million led by General Catalyst and a $45 million Series B funding round led by Founders Fund. Bitcoin’s sharp reaction has revived discussion about its use as a geopolitical risk asset. Traders moved quickly following the ceasefire news, reinforcing the view that crypto can respond faster than traditional markets during global uncertainty. Polymarket’s activity represents growing interest in decentralized tools for gauging political outcomes. The platform’s rising volume suggests users are turning to crypto-based prediction markets for faster insights on diplomacy, conflict, and major international decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Polymarket different from traditional prediction tools? Polymarket uses blockchain infrastructure to settle predictions on-chain, providing transparent odds and rapid resolution of outcomes. How does Polymarket maintain credibility and accuracy? Outcomes on Polymarket are resolved using third-party oracles and predefined criteria, reducing subjective intervention. Disputes are resolved via decentralized governance, which supports integrity and transparency. Could Polymarket’s growth lead to regulatory scrutiny? As the platform gains traction and funding, it may attract attention from U.S. regulators, especially given the uncertain legal classification of prediction markets in jurisdictions like the United States.

2025-06-24T18:25:08,"Here’s the Current Status of the Altcoin Season Index – Analyst Takes an In-Depth Look at Potential Altcoin Bull Run","Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch drew attention to Bitcoin's market dominance in his assessment and warned about the upcoming altcoin season. According to Koch, for altcoin seasons to begin, Bitcoin’s market dominance rate must first reach a cycle peak. This rate peaked at around 70% in previous bull markets. It is currently around 66% and is trending upward. The US attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend has raised tensions in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump described the operation as a “complete success”, while the Iranian government reacted by accusing the US of crossing red lines and declaring that all US bases in the region were potential targets. Iran also threatened to halt maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz. These developments increased the perception of risk in financial markets. As in traditional crisis periods, investors turned to safe havens (gold, oil, and in this case Bitcoin) instead of risky assets (such as altcoins). This increased Bitcoin's market dominance, reaching 66%, the highest level in recent years. This increase is considered the biggest obstacle to the start of the altcoin season. However, Iran subsequently hit the US base in Qatar with prior notice and reduced tensions. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio between the market value of Bitcoin and the total value of the entire cryptocurrency market. When this ratio increases, it means that the vast majority of investors are holding their money in Bitcoin. When it decreases, capital is shifting towards altcoins. This shift is seen as one of the main signs of altcoin season. “Bitcoin dominance usually peaks towards the end of bull cycles and then declines. Along with this decline, altcoins experience sudden and sharp increases,” said analyst Simeon Koch. However, he added that this period carries serious risks despite the high profit potential. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List a New Surprise Altcoin Koch stated that technical indicators show that a peak formation is approaching in Bitcoin dominance. Indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index) are in the overbought region. In addition, the inverse correlation of the global liquidity index also indicates that there may be a decrease in dominance in the near future. If this scenario occurs, it is stated that the altcoin season may begin with the capital rotation shifting to altcoins. According to the analyst, when past cycles are examined, it is seen that the altcoin season usually begins in periods when Bitcoin dominance has been continuously falling for several weeks or months. During these periods, major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP outperform Bitcoin, indicating that investors' risk appetite has increased. Tools like the Altcoin Season Index are also used to track this. This index indicates that an altcoin season has begun if 75% of the largest altcoins have risen more than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 16, indicating Bitcoin’s continued dominance. Koch noted that altcoin season is the period when the highest gains are seen in the crypto market, but also carries the highest risks: “Investors may want to get on the track when the music is playing loudest. But it is also necessary to see the exit in time. The altcoin season ends at its peak, and a severe bear market may follow immediately.” *This is not investment advice.

Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Driving the markets were hopes that the conflict between Iran and Israel would cease for now. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries. Moreover, he pressured Israel to stop its attacks against Iran, which promised hope for an end to the war. The escalation of a broader conflict threatened the global oil economy. This was particularly true after the U.S. got directly involved with its own strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. After these strikes, Iran even threatened to push the price of oil to its historic levels by closing the Strait of Hormuz. The price of crude oil dropped back down to $64 per barrel, down 5.33% in just one day. Crude oil traded near $75 at the height of the crisis, the highest price since January this year.

Texas and Oklahoma have barred certain financial institutions from state contracts over alleged bias against the fossil fuel and firearms industries. The Trump administration may issue an executive order restricting “debanking” on political or religious grounds. JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are taking steps to address concerns raised by Republican-led states over alleged political bias, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on June 24. The banks have held meetings with officials in Texas and Oklahoma to respond to accusations that they limit services to industries such as fossil fuels and firearms. Some of these states have blacklisted banks from contracts over policies perceived as discriminatory. Banks Scale Back “Woke” Policies “I’m not asking them to be MAGA banks,” said Todd Russ, Oklahoma’s state treasurer. “I want them to manage my portfolio and stay out of these political ideologies. I think they realize that’s a fair place to be.” Citigroup recently ended a policy that restricted business with firearms vendors selling to buyers under 21, a move discussed during a meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. JPMorgan and others have updated their policies to clarify that they do not base decisions on political views. Banks have also withdrawn from climate alliances targeted by Republican officials. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and others are reevaluating restrictions on coal-related activities. Bank of America lifted a ban on coal financing last year. At the federal level, the Trump administration is reportedly considering an executive order to prevent “debanking” based on political or religious views. This order could impact banks’ ability to engage in government business, including selling Treasury bonds. In Congress, Republican senators have proposed legislation barring regulators from using reputational risk as a factor in exams. The Federal Reserve recently announced it would no longer apply that standard, following direction from Trump-aligned officials. Trump Expands Crypto Push Against the backdrop of rising tensions between major financial institutions and Republican leadership, Trump’s expanding crypto activity introduces another potential fault line. By backing a Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF under the Truth Social brand, his media group is positioning itself at odds with institutions under scrutiny for ESG-linked decisions or perceived political biases.

In a new interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, McInerney says Visa has long been preparing for the greater adoption of stablecoins. “We’ve been embracing and building for years, preparing for this moment. The GENIUS Act has now passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House. I think that will give regulatory clarity [for] stablecoins. And we’ve been embracing stablecoins. We’ve been enabling people to issue Visa credentials on top of stablecoins, we’ve been modernizing our own settlement infrastructure with stablecoins and we have a whole host of innovations that we plan to deploy around the world embracing stablecoins.” While Visa’s stock declined after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, McInerney says that Visa could enable stablecoin use across its payments network if there’s a demand for it. “For payments, you need three things. You need trust, you need ease of use and you need scale. And the reason why we have close to 5 billion Visa credentials around the world, the reason why we have 14 billion Visa tokens around the world and the reason why 150 million merchants around the world depend on Visa to grow their businesses is because nobody does that better than Visa. And if stablecoins become a mode of currency that people want to embrace around the world we will enable that on the Visa system and scale that to those billions of end points. That’s what you need to do well in payments, that’s what Visa does better than anybody in the world.” Visa is trading for $350 at time of writing, down from its 52-week high of $375.

2025-06-24T18:00:18,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Surging as Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors Move into Litecoin","As the 2025 crypto market enters a new phase, seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investors are increasingly turning their attention to both established altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and high-upside pre-sale opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This strategic capital rotation is fueling surging demand for early-stage tokens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the year’s most watched new entries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Pre-Sale of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become a magnet for traders seeking high-return potential, securing over $10 million and selling out each round with remarkable speed. Its capped token supply, verified HashEx audit, and transparent rollout have positioned it as a standout project among early-stage assets . Rather than relying on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on a structured, community-first approach. The combination of scarcity-based tokenomics, strong governance, and growing demand has led many to view it as one of the few altcoin projects with the infrastructure and investor backing to thrive in a post-cycle environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Rotation Fuels New Opportunities With Bitcoin crossing $111,000 and Ethereum holding between $2,800 and $3,000, both are widely seen as market leaders with more modest near-term upside. As institutional inflows stabilize and ETF-driven sentiment matures, some investors are now redirecting a portion of their capital toward alternative assets with asymmetric return profiles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a leading destination for those seeking that kind of opportunity, gaining traction among both early adopters and traditional holders. Litecoin: Reliable Performer with Fresh Momentum Often referred to as “digital silver,” Litecoin is reemerging in 2025 as a strong performer with renewed attention. As Litecoin benefits from reduced fees, strong transactional history, and ETF-related interest, it’s also clear that many traders are simultaneously turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its early-stage appeal. The dual interest highlights a broader trend: investors are looking for both reliability and upside potential in the same portfolio. Conclusion The reallocation of capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum into Litecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE marks a shift in how investors approach the 2025 market. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading in early-stage demand and Litecoin showing signs of resurgence, many are positioning themselves now in anticipation of the next altcoin rally.

2025-06-24T18:00:18,"Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply","Bitcoin is trading above the $105,000 level after a sharp rebound triggered by the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical relief provided a strong tailwind for risk assets, and BTC responded with a powerful surge, regaining a critical psychological level that had previously flipped into resistance. Now, as bulls regain momentum, Bitcoin is flirting with a potential breakout above the $110,000 mark — a key level that capped rallies throughout June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction This renewed strength comes after several days of volatility and fear, where BTC dipped to as low as $98,200 amid escalating conflict in the Middle East. However, the swift recovery has shifted sentiment back in favor of the bulls. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, there has been a heavy spike in Taker Buy Volume over the past 48 hours — a strong signal that aggressive market participants are stepping in with conviction. These buy-side imbalances suggest that institutional and high-conviction traders are positioning for further upside. As the market heats up and risk appetite grows, a breakout above the $110K resistance could confirm the start of a new bullish impulse. For now, all eyes are on whether BTC can hold and extend above current levels. Bitcoin Faces Uncertainty As Bulls Defend Structure Bitcoin is currently facing a critical test, trading in a tight range after failing to break above its all-time high. Although bulls have managed to defend the overall structure and keep BTC above key moving averages, the price action has not provided a clear directional signal. The asset is roughly 6% down from its $112K peak, and while some traders expect an imminent breakout toward new highs, others warn of a potential retrace below the $100K psychological level. This divide among analysts stems from ongoing geopolitical instability — particularly in the Middle East — and tightening macroeconomic conditions. The Fed’s commitment to elevated interest rates and rising US Treasury yields continues to weigh on risk sentiment, making it difficult for BTC to build sustained momentum. Despite the uncertainty, buyers have shown signs of strength, with many looking to confirm the recent bounce as a solid bottom. Top analyst Maartunn highlighted one key bullish signal: heavy spikes in Taker Buy Volume, which indicate aggressive market orders being filled on the buy side. This suggests that high-conviction buyers are stepping in at current levels, potentially front-running a larger move to the upside. While this is a positive sign for short-term sentiment, Bitcoin must still reclaim the $109K–$112K range to invalidate the risk of a broader correction. Until then, traders remain cautious. If BTC closes a daily candle below the $103.6K support or loses the $100K level again, it could trigger a wave of liquidations and send prices lower. On the other hand, holding above $105K and building volume could set the stage for the next leg up. The coming days will be crucial in defining Bitcoin’s path forward. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move BTC Surges Above Key Support As Buyers Step In The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a strong bullish reaction after a brief dip below the $103,600 support level. The price rebounded sharply, reclaiming both the 100 and 50-period moving averages (green and blue lines, respectively), with BTC now trading around $105,357. This move confirms the importance of the $103,600 zone as a high-demand area, which has acted as a launchpad multiple times since early May. Volume surged on the recent bounce, indicating aggressive buying activity. The spike suggests whales and institutional buyers likely absorbed the panic selling triggered by geopolitical events earlier in the week. Price is now approaching the $109,300 resistance level, a key ceiling that capped multiple rallies in May and June. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 The short-term momentum remains constructive as long as BTC holds above the moving averages. However, a rejection near $109K could confirm a broader consolidation range between $103K and $109K. If bulls manage to flip $109,300 into support, the path to retest the all-time highs around $112K opens up.

The company built and operates more than 30 sites across Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wyoming. A vertically integrated setup gives CleanSpark control over energy procurement and operations, helping reduce costs and boost uptime. “It reflects years of focused strategy, disciplined execution, and a relentless commitment to doing things the right way,” said CEO Zach Bradford. Hashrate is a metric used to measure the computing power behind the Bitcoin network. The higher a given company’s hashrate, the higher its chances of earning bitcoin rewards. The firm is now preparing to scale up to 60 EH/s, with Bradford stating the company was in “escape velocity” mode. Meanwhile, CleanSpark’s Digital Asset Management arm has begun actively managing over 12,500 self-mined bitcoin to generate returns and support expansion without issuing new shares. “We’re mining bitcoin efficiently, holding it responsibly, and putting it to work in ways that drive shareholder value,” Bradford said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-hits-50-eh-s-hashrate-milestone,"BTC|MARKET|MINING","Markets|CleanSpark|Bitcoin Miner|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T17:43:02,"Banks Authorized For Crypto Activities, Confirms Federal Reserve Chair Powell","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced on Tuesday that banks will have the autonomy to determine their customer base, signaling an open door for digital asset investors and the introduction of new investment products centered around crypto assets. Freedom To Engage In Crypto Activities During his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell emphasized that banks are now positioned to offer banking services specifically tailored to the cryptocurrency industry and its associated companies. On Tuesday, Powell further stressed that these digital asset activities must be conducted with a focus on maintaining safety and soundness for everyday investors. This announcement follows the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to remove reputational risk from its bank examination criteria on Monday, a change that aligns with similar actions taken by other US banking regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Banks had expressed concerns that the previous emphasis on reputational risk could lead to subjective judgments from regulators, potentially penalizing institutions for engaging in legally permissible activities, including cryptocurrency, that do not pose significant financial risks. With the removal of this standard, the Federal Reserve has signaled a more lenient regulatory environment, allowing financial institutions to engage more freely in crypto-related projects and offerings. Inflation Forecast Addressing broader economic issues that can influence cryptocurrency prices, Powell highlighted ongoing concerns about inflation, which remains above the Fed’s target of 2%. The Fed chair noted that the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the economy is still uncertain, stating, “Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain.” Powell explained that the effects of tariffs will depend on their ultimate levels and that historically, tariffs have led to one-time price increases rather than sustained inflationary pressures. As for inflation metrics, Powell indicated that the Fed’s preferred measure is likely to rise to 2.3% in May, with the core measure—excluding food and energy—expected to edge up to 2.6%. In April, these figures were recorded at 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are carefully considering these dynamics and do not feel rushed to adjust policy until more data on the impact of tariffs becomes available.

Per data shared by on-chain and financial metrics platform Glassnode, Solana ( SOL ) CME Futures volume has hit 1.75 million contracts. The milestone, reached in the past 24 hours, coincided with a notable reversal for the SOL token. Its price bounced off lows of $125 in the wake of the Middle East conflict to hit highs of $146. At its current value, the altcoin is about 50% off its all-time high of $294 reached in January 2025.

This surge suggests institutional investors are positioning aggressively as price rebounds to ~$145. Track SOL derivatives data: https://t.co/yClXheGVZB pic.twitter.com/wmmA3kdwkB — glassnode (@glassnode) June 24, 2025 The SOL token last traded above $150 on June 20,2025, with the subsequent dump to lows of $125 coming amid the sell-off that also drove Bitcoin ( BTC ) to near $98k. But the benchmark digital asset has since bounced to above $105k, fueling gains across the crypto market . Solana’s gains have cut weekly losses for SOL price to under 1% as at the time of writing. CME Group announced the launch of SOL futures in March 2025, offering access to micro-sized contracts and larger-sized contracts. Market participants can choose between the 25 SOL micro-sized contract or the larger 500 SOL contract. “With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s global head of cryptocurrency products, said. After a slow start, with less than 400k in volume in April and May, the metric picked up and surpassed 1 million contracts this week. Analysts have opined that notable CME futures volume could be a signal for demand for Solana exchange-traded funds. Recently, experts gave SOL spot ETFs a 95% chance of approval in 2025. Coinglass data shows open interest in Solana has increased to over $6 billion. Meanwhile, derivatives volume has increased by more than 28% to $19.2 billion.

Just one day after announcing a $1 billion SPAC deal, ProCap scooped up 3,724 Bitcoin, locking in exposure for investors before markets could blink. According to a June 24 press release , Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC, LLC purchased 3,724 Bitcoins (BTC) at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per BTC on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after announcing its $1 billion SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The aggressive initial purchase, worth roughly $387 million, was funded directly from a $750 million capital raise disclosed as part of the SPAC deal. The newly created company plans to hold the full amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and is expected to continue accumulating after it transitions into ProCap Financial, Inc., a publicly traded entity focused on institutional-grade Bitcoin services. You might also like: Chainlink and Mastercard partner to enable onchain crypto purchases Anthony Pompliano’s billion-dollar bet on the new institutional standard For Pompliano and his team, the decision to buy and hold $387 million worth of Bitcoin as part of a long-term accumulation strategy is less about optics and more about conviction. In public remarks and SEC filings, ProCap has made it clear that it views BTC not just as an asset, but as a benchmark. “Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate,” the company stated—underscoring its belief that the cryptocurrency is no longer speculative, but rather the minimum acceptable performance standard for capital deployment. By frontloading its BTC treasury with millions worth of the original cryptocurrency instead of holding idle dollars post-raise, ProCap is signaling a departure from traditional finance’s risk-averse playbook and leaning into Bitcoin as a base-layer financial asset. This isn’t just theory. Since 2020, public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets have outperformed their cash-heavy peers by staggering margins. Strategy, the most aggressive corporate adopter, saw its stock surge more than 3,000% at one point, not because of its core software business, but because of its Bitcoin treasury. Now, ProCap is doubling down on the same playbook, but with a twist: It’s not just hoarding BTC: it’s building financial infrastructure around it.

This news has caused the company’s value, once a small UK-based web design business, to jump from £3.7 million to over £1 billion. This dramatic rise followed its decision to buy large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a new business strategy. Smarter Web Makes A Big Move into Bitcoin Treasury On Tuesday, Smarter Web announced it bought 196.9 more BTC for £15.2 million, equivalent to $20.3 million. The company now owns 543.52 Bitcoins. They paid an average price of £77,988 for each coin, about $104,450. So far, Smarter Web has invested £42.4 million, or $56.8 million, in Bitcoin. At the same time, the company continues to provide web design, development, and online marketing services. It also earns money through setup fees, yearly hosting charges, and optional monthly plans. However, since April, the company, like many others, has also focused on building a Bitcoin treasury . In 2023, Smarter Web started accepting Bitcoin payments, believing it would be necessary for the future financial system. Confidence Fueled By Long-Term Gains with BTC The Smarter Web Company shared a 10-year growth plan to expand its customer base through web services and buy more Bitcoin when the time is right. The goal is to increase the company’s value and deliver long-term returns to shareholders. Since starting this plan, the company has become the UK’s largest Bitcoin holder. After a reverse takeover, it began trading on the Aquis Stock Exchange on April 25 with a value of about £3.7 million ($5 million). After announcing its Bitcoin strategy, its stock price soared nearly 20,000%, pushing its company value above £1 billion, equivalent to $1.4 billion. Even after a recent drop, Smarter Web remains the top company listed on Aquis. Smarter Web Backed By Bitcoin Heavyweights The Smarter Web Company is not making these moves alone. It is working with UTXO Management, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm led by David Bailey. David Bailey also runs Bitcoin Magazine and founded Nakamoto, a company that recently secured $51.5 million through a private deal. Bailey and UTXO’s Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, are on the company’s board. UTXO also invested in Smarter Web before it went public and is involved in other Bitcoin firms like Metaplanet and The Blockchain Group. While Smarter Web believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is unconvinced. The agency has warned that this kind of investment is high risk due to Bitcoin’s price swings. Coinbase’s David Duong also warned that companies using borrowed money to buy crypto could pose financial risks. However, he noted that the danger is still relatively limited.

2025-06-24T17:15:02,"Something Funky Has Been Happening to the Bitcoin Markets Since 2021: Details","The number of Bitcoin (BTC) deposit addresses on exchanges has dropped sharply. Such a pattern points to a deepening long-term conviction among investors. Data reveals a dramatic reversal in behavior that began after the 2021 cycle peak. Between 2015 and 2021, the number of unique addresses depositing BTC to exchanges steadily increased, averaging 180,000 annually. However, since 2022, that trend has not only stalled, but it has declined consistently. BTC Exchange Deposit Trend Reverses According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the 10-year average now stands at approximately 90,000, while the current 30-day moving average is just 48,000. On a daily basis, the number of depositing addresses has dropped to around 37,000, recording a multi-year low. Analysts say that this indicates a growing preference for holding Bitcoin rather than trading it. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has played a key role, which gave institutional and retail investors access to BTC’s price performance without needing to move or manage the asset directly. Additionally, lower retail trading activity in the current cycle has reduced active deposit behavior. At the same time, an increasing number of investors, and even corporations , are adopting a savings-oriented approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative instrument. The report said, “These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value.” This sentiment in investor behavior is echoed on a macro scale. Bitcoin As Modern Reserve Asset Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic asset for nations seeking to strengthen economic resilience in the current global landscape, according to a recent report by CoinShares. The cryptocurrency’s potential to hedge inflation, diversify sovereign portfolios, and offer protection against geopolitical instability positions it as a modern complement to gold and foreign exchange reserves. While the US decision in 2025 to add Bitcoin to its reserves is a crucial moment, CoinShares noted that the ongoing skepticism among economists who highlight its volatility and speculative nature. Despite this, with rising global debt, inflation, and mounting geopolitical tensions, more governments are exploring alternatives. Brazil’s RESBit proposal and Russia’s reported interest in Bitcoin reserves suggest a competitive push to secure a share of the asset’s fixed supply. With a $2 trillion market cap and growing institutional presence, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible reserve option alongside traditional holdings.

2025-06-24T17:11:31,"Israel-Iran Ceasefire Breakthrough Sends Crypto Markets Upwards; Bitcoin Bursts Back Above $106K","The crypto market rebounded during early Asian trading hours Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire between Iran and Israel had come into effect, triggering a sharp comeback across Bitcoin and major altcoins. The move seems to have largely erased recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment. Markets Gain As Tensions Ease Relief from the Middle East conflict in the form of a surprise ceasefire spurred a crypto and risk-asset rally. President Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump wrote. Crypto markets have turned nicely higher, with Bitcoin (BTC) now up by 5.1% over the past 24 hours to $106,017 after the brutal Sunday-Monday crash. The premier crypto had plummeted below the psychologically important $100,000 level on Sunday before staging its recovery. Bitcoin has historically trended positively during times of global unrest. During major events like the US–Iran conflict in 2020, Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022, and now the Iran–Israel war of 2025, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price stability. While it does not act like a traditional safe haven, it usually behaves like an uncorrelated hedge in systemic uncertainty. Ether (ETH), the industry’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is ahead 10.6% to trade back above $2,455. Ripple-promoted cryptocurrency XRP surged 11.2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto’s double-digit spike comes after Arthur Britto, co-founder of Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), posted on X for the first time in nearly 14 years. According to market data, Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and Dogecoin (DOGE) also rose between 9.6%-10% following the news of a possible ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/israel-iran-ceasefire-breakthrough-sends-crypto-markets-upwards-bitcoin-bursts-back-above-106k/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T17:06:37,"Why is crypto up today? Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins see big gains","The overall crypto market cap rose 2.3% as traders hoped for de-escalation in the Middle East. Crypto markets saw notable gains on Tuesday, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the rally. On Tuesday, June 24, Bitcoin climbed 5.3%, rising back above $105,000. Altcoins performed even better, posting double-digit gains, with the total crypto market cap up 5.19%. Ethereum (ETH) was among the strongest performers, up 11.33%. Altcoins also saw big gains, with XRP (XRP) up 10.15%, Solana (SOL) rising 9.61%, and Cardano (ADA) up 9.4%. Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also saw strong growth, nearing double digits. The most likely catalyst for this rally was growing optimism that tensions in the Middle East are easing. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel be stricly respected on both sides. You might also like: Stablecoins and oil are Trump’s macro weapons, says DeVere CEO The ceasefire came after U.S. bombers targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, prompting a symbolic response from Iran via strikes on U.S. bases in Qatar. Iran reportedly gave ample warning, allowing U.S. personnel to evacuate and avoid escalation. This development brought relief to traders, as a prolonged war, especially one involving the U.S., threatened to destabilize the global economy. In particular, heightened tensions had driven up oil prices, stoking fears of rising global inflation. In particular, at one point, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of global oil production flows every day. In this environment, central banks are forced to raise interest rates, which hurts risk assets like crypto. You might also like: Oil, inflation, and Bitcoin are now locked in the same trade Where will Bitcoin and Ethereum go next? The ceasefire between Iran and Israel is fragile, as seen by Israeli strikes on Iran soon after Trump announced the deal. Still, an irate response from Trump seems to have caused Israel to back down. In any case, the risk of further escalation is lower now than it was two weeks ago. Traders, both retail and institutional, will now likely take a more risk-on approach. Future catalysts for growth include the GENIUS Act , which will bring the first regulatory framework for stablecoins to the U.S. Institutions will also likely continue to buy up Bitcoin for their treasuries.

Crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may enter a downward phase after hitting a historic peak level, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. “BTC dominance: if history repeats, the real altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin dominance rejects from 71% (red).” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC.D is a metric that calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are printing gains faster than BTC. The analyst also says BTC.D may not hit exactly 71% before reversing, but somewhere within that area. “There really is no point in arguing about whether BTC.D will ultimately top out at 71% or at 69% or at 67%. The majority of the Bitcoin dominance macro uptrend has already taken place. And just like in every BTC.D cycle, it got close to 71%.” Lastly, the analyst says that as BTC.D rises to its peak, altcoins won’t completely collapse in value, but may have significant corrections before the altseason begins. “This past February, Bitcoin dominance rallied from 58% to 64%. That’s a 6% increase. Now, Bitcoin dominance is only [5.7%] away from 71%. Altcoins won’t go to $0.00. Instead, [alts] may react similarly to February 2025.” Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 65.30%.

2025-06-24T16:55:29,"Dogwifhat Rockets 20% as Bitcoin Breaches $106K – Is a $1.00 Breakout Next?","Dogwifhat ($WIF) has rocketed 20% in 24 hours, punching past $0.86 as Bitcoin smashes $106K—putting the Solana meme coin within striking distance of the $1.00 milestone. The gains follow a sharp reversal from $WIF’s recent lows below $0.72, fueled by a 22% spike in active wallets and over $70M in daily volume. Analysts now watch the $0.83 support level, with a breakout potentially igniting a broader Solana meme coin rally. Market Position and Ecosystem Developments The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a strong resurgence, with $WIF maintaining a strong position. Currently ranked as the 45th-largest digital asset by market capitalization (~$1.76B), it trails giants like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) but continues to outpace competitors such as $FLOKI, $PEPE, and $BONK in terms of trading volume and visibility. wif just woke up from hibernation +up 24.1% today mcap: $865M 24h volume: $719M still the dog with the hat still barkin’ louder than the rest pic.twitter.com/RGJzSIJRBO — madmix (@madmixnum) June 24, 2025 The past 48 hours have seen particularly strong network activity, with daily trading volume surpassing $700 million and a 22% increase in active wallets interacting with $WIF liquidity pools. The project’s ecosystem continues to expand through strategic partnerships and integrations. Since its November 2024 listing on Robinhood, $WIF has gained improved accessibility for retail traders. Community Strength and Future Outlook The community engagement around $WIF sets it apart in the crowded meme coin space. While many meme coins rise and fall with the whims of internet hype, $WIF has shown an impressive ability to stay put, owing to a community that’s as creative as it is committed. Instead of being driven by a central team, $WIF’s momentum comes from the grassroots: token holders have come together to fund everything from eye-catching billboards to exclusive merch drops, all in the name of spreading the word and having fun. Looking ahead, $WIF’s journey will depend on a few key factors. Its price action is closely linked to Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $106,000 and the ongoing strength of the Solana ecosystem. Any new exchange listings or partnership news could give $WIF an extra boost, while shifts in social chatter and trading volume will offer important hints about whether this rally is built to last. Even with a promising technical setup, savvy traders know that meme coins are never a sure thing—volatility is part of the game. That’s why smart risk management is as important as optimism, especially when the market feels bullish. All eyes will be on $WIF in the coming week. If it can hold its current ground, a push toward the $1.00 mark could be in the cards—a move that would almost certainly turn heads and spark even more excitement around this community-driven coin. Technical Breakout Points to Further Potential The current price action reveals a compelling technical story for $WIF. The coin has successfully broken out from a descending wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic bullish reversal formation that has developed over the past week. Source: TradingView This breakout was confirmed when $WIF decisively cleared the $0.83 resistance level, accompanied by increased trading volume that lends credibility to the move. The Relative Strength Index, while rising, remains comfortably below overbought territory at 62, suggesting there is still room for upward movement before the asset becomes technically extended. $WIF | @dogwifcoin Holding the 0.702 Fib…For Now One Last Shakeout Likely Moon-Shot Loading pic.twitter.com/WSOn51xcYM — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) June 23, 2025 Looking at key price levels, traders are now watching the $0.91 mark, representing a Fibonacci retracement level from June’s price action, followed by the psychologically key $1.00 threshold. The measured move from the wedge pattern’s breakout point suggests potential for $WIF to test these levels in the near term . However, should the price fail to maintain its footing above $0.83, we could see a retest of support levels at $0.78 or even a return to the $0.72 base that marked recent lows.

Useless Coin ( USELESS ), a meme coin on Solana ( SOL ), jumped to a high of $0.1462, up by 2,470% from its lowest point this month. This surge has pushed its market cap to over $133 million. The token surge accelerated as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins rose following Israel’s truce with Iran. It also jumped after two Fed officials, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, said that they would support an interest rate cut of 0.25% in the July meeting. Nansen data shows that whales have continued accumulating the token this week. Their holdings rose by 15% in the last 30 days to 381 million. Whale holdings are among the most popular bullish signals, as these investors are seen as more experienced than retail traders. You might also like: Monero price approaching $269 support: is this a setup for a major rally? Additional data shows that exchange balances of the Useless token have dropped by 13% in the last 30 days to 51.4 million. Useless Coin’s price is also rising likely due to Fear of Missing Out among retail investors. It’s common for newly launched tokens to rally as investors speculate it might be the next big thing. In most cases, however, these surges are short-lived, with tokens often pulling back as early investors take profits. A notable example is Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which surged in its early days in January before plunging. Useless Coin price technical analysis Useless Coin chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that Useless Coin has been in a strong bull run over the past few weeks. It has climbed from a low of $0.00546 in June to a high of $0.1462. The token has rallied above both the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages. It has also broken above the upper side of an ascending channel. Useless Coin’s Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator have both moved into overbought territory.

2025-06-24T16:40:08,"Expert Decodes Ripple Co-founder’s Message to the XRP Community","Arthur Britto, one of the elusive co-founders of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), stunned the crypto world by breaking a 14-year silence with a single post on X—an emoji: . Though minimal, this gesture has sparked widespread interpretation, particularly by prominent influencer Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem. Her analysis suggests Britto’s post may be a deliberate signal of support for Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin investor now facing legal battles. The implications are profound, tying together Ripple’s history, founding vision, and the current state of crypto justice. Arthur Britto: The Silent Visionary Arthur Britto is famously private. He has never granted interviews, has no known public images, and follows only two accounts on X: Ripple Custody CEO Jack McDonald and Roger Ver. His most notable public commentary dates back to 2013, when he described XRP as “the plumbing you don’t see,” suggesting it was designed to work silently in the background. Though I may be mistaken, I believe @ahbritto ’s use of the no mouth emoji signals a very noteworthy point. Arthur, who follows only @_JackMcDonald_ and @rogerkver , seems to underscore Roger’s current struggle. Jack led his groundbreaking technology alongside @JoelKatz , while… pic.twitter.com/bSZTtR6Sz9 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 24, 2025 Given this long-standing silence, Britto’s recent emoji post carries significant weight. Crypto Eri’s interpretation of the “no mouth” emoji is that it reflects silence, censorship, or suppressed truth, a potential nod to Roger Ver’s current struggle. Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Roger Ver, once dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus,” played a key role in Ripple’s early development. He was one of its first investors, providing critical funding that helped launch the XRPL in 2012. Today, he faces serious legal trouble. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged him with tax evasion and mail fraud, alleging he failed to pay nearly $48 million in exit taxes after renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014. Ver was arrested in Spain in April 2024 and now faces possible extradition. His supporters argue that the charges are politically motivated and that the government is targeting him for his libertarian beliefs and outspoken stance against U.S. financial oversight. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Symbol Ripple CTO David Schwartz has also spoken out in defense of Ver, stating the case is “way more evil than most people realize.” He emphasized Ver’s integrity and his vital role in both Bitcoin and Ripple’s early days. Now, Britto’s silent post appears to reinforce that sentiment. Crypto Eri’s commentary highlights the deeper meaning behind the emoji. She compares the situation to the campaign for Ross Ulbricht’s release, suggesting the crypto community should rally similarly behind Roger Ver. Britto, through his rare appearance, may be encouraging that same sense of solidarity. The Bigger Message Britto’s post is more than just a cryptic emoji; it is a powerful, silent protest. As one of Ripple’s founding minds, his subtle gesture echoes a call for justice and fair treatment, not just for Roger Ver, but for any individual caught at the intersection of innovation and regulation. Crypto Eri’s interpretation resonates deeply across the XRP community. In a space where symbols often speak louder than words, Britto’s emoji may stand as one of the clearest statements yet: fairness matters, and the community must remain vigilant. In the end, the message is clear—even the quietest voices can carry the loudest truths. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-24T16:30:17,"Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000?","Ethereum’s price action in the past 24 hours has been characterized by a fall toward $2,100 before rebounding to the upside very quickly. Ethereum’s price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum’s next major target around $6,000. Wave A Complete, But Downside Likely Before Rally The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum’s price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets Now that the Wave A pattern is complete, the prediction is a short-term bounce to as high as $2,792 as part of a wave B retracement. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. This level is what the analyst refers to as his “ideal buy zone” for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete. Wyckoff Structure Points $6,000 ETH Price Merlijn, a popular analyst on X, shared a contrasting yet converging perspective. In this case, the analyst’s outlook is based on Wyckoff’s accumulation framework. Merlijn stated, “Ethereum: Wyckoff says go.” Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to the daily price chart that followed his analysis, the analyst showed that the crypto had already completed the spring and test phases, which are both components of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. What comes next, according to the Wyckoff method, is the markup phase. The chart Merlijn posted aligns with this outlook. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in. Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,420, up by 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-24T16:23:09,"Analyst sets new date when Bitcoin will hit $130,000","With Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaiming the $105,000 level, a trading expert is projecting the cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 within weeks. The forecast follows Bitcoin’s rebound from its one-day Exponential Moving Average 100 (EMA), a key trend line that has historically marked the beginning of major bull runs, according to a June 24 TradingView analysis by TradingShot . The rebound also coincided with a de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two nations. Technically, the EMA100 has served as a critical support level since Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022. Since then, each major rally has either originated from or touched this moving average, triggering strong upward moves. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin dipped slightly below the EMA100 in the first bullish wave before rallying to the 1.382 Fibonacci extension . The second wave bounced directly off the EMA100 and reached the 1.618 level. In the third leg, the price came close to the trend line before surging toward the 2.0 Fibonacci extension. Bitcoin is forming a fourth bullish channel, mirroring the previous patterns. TradingShot noted that each rally has produced progressively higher Fibonacci peaks, suggesting the current move could surpass the 2.0 level of around $168,000. However, the analysis offers a more conservative near-term target of $130,000, aligned with the 1.382 Fibonacci extension, which could be reached by early August 2025. Bitcoin FUD moment Meanwhile, a similar analysis by Ted Pillows, shared in an X post on June 24, suggests that Bitcoin’s current price behavior indicates every major Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) event has historically marked the asset’s bottom, often preceding strong recoveries. Key events such as the 2023 Silvergate liquidity scare, the 2022 FTX collapse, the 2024 Japan Carry Trade unwind, Trump’s tariff announcement, and the recent U.S.-Iran conflict have all aligned with significant price lows. Pillows noted that with signs of de-escalation in global tensions, especially the recent ceasefire, Bitcoin may have already reached its bottom or is nearing it. https://twitter.com/TedPillows/status/1937480575079841965 Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,490, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours, while in the past week, the asset 1.1%.

2025-06-24T16:15:48,"Bitcoin Mining Profitability Records Almost 20% Spike: Report","According to a Jefferies report, Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability reportedly recorded almost a 20% uptick. This surge coincided with a nearly equal spike in the price of flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin and a modest gain in the network hashrate. BTC Price Increases as Gold Price Spikes On Monday, investment firm Jefferies published a research report detailing Bitcoin mining progress. BTC mining profitability rose by 18.2% in May while the network hashrate gained 3.5%. This hashrate is the collective computational power used to mine and process transactions on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain like Bitcoin. Apart from the increase in hashrate, which serves as a proxy for competition amongst miners, Bitcoin price registered some profits, spurred by the recent rally in gold price . For context, investors turned to inflation-protected assets with the spike in gold prices. According to Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul, analysts from Jeffries, this move was in anticipation of a ballooning fiscal deficit in the United States, amongst other countries. MARA Holdings and CleanSpark Leads US-listed Mining Companies Jeffries’ report also listed the volume of Bitcoin mined by US mining companies last month. All the US-listed mining facilities mined a total of 3,754 BTC. According to the report, this is a notable increase compared to April, when they only mined 3,278 BTC. On the other hand, miners in North America made up 26.3% of the total network in May, compared to 24.1% the previous month. Out of this group, MARA Holdings (MARA) mined 950 Bitcoin, marking a 35% increase from April. It has successfully raised its total reserves to 49,179 BTC. It was followed by CleanSpark (CLSK) at 694 mined Bitcoin. It is worth noting that MARA’s hashrate is still the largest at 58.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Records Slight Decline Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty has recorded a slight decline following a record high. This outlook offers some relief to miners, especially those who are dealing with rising costs and reduced block rewards. In mid-June, CryptoQuant shared data showing that the mining difficulty stood at around 126.4 trillion. This was just below the All-Time High (ATH) of 126.9 trillion recorded on May 31. Mining difficulty adjusts every two weeks to ensure that new blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. This is regardless of how much computing power is in the network. Therefore, the new mining difficulty record is expected in a few days.

2025-06-24T16:13:54,"Japan’s FSA proposes classifying cryptocurrencies as financial products","Regulators in Japan want to reclassify the legal status of cryptocurrencies as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The proposal , introduced by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on June 24, is part of a broader push to align the country’s financial system with its “New Capitalism” strategy, which aims to transform Japan into a more investment-driven economy. Under the proposed changes, cryptocurrencies would move from the existing regulatory scope of the Payment Services Act to the more comprehensive Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), the same framework that governs securities and traditional financial products. If adopted, this would allow for the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan and reduce the capital gains tax on crypto from a rate of up to 55% to a flat 20%, putting it in line with taxation on stock investments. Among other provisions are plans to establish a dedicated working group to examine the proposed reclassification and oversee regulatory developments. In the policy document, the FSA has highlighted how crypto adoption in the country has seen a noticeable uptick over the past years. As of January 2025, over 12.1 million domestic crypto accounts were active, and crypto holdings on platforms exceeded 5 trillion yen (approximately $34 billion). The FSA said that crypto ownership has outpaced participation in traditional instruments such as FX trading and corporate bonds, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. With this proposal, Japan hopes to catch up with the progress made across leading economies like the United States, where Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products have seen great success. Citing data from March 2025, the FSA pointed to more than 1,200 financial institutions, including U.S. pension funds and Goldman Sachs, now holding U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. Japan advances crypto regulations Before unveiling its June proposal, FSA had already moved to redefine crypto through a draft framework categorising tokens by function and structure. At the time, the FSA proposed classifying tokens based on their economic role and governance model, separating fundraising assets, labeled Type 1, from decentralized, non-fundraising tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, now referred to as Type 2. Japanese regulators have warmed up to the crypto sector over the past years, and there have been growing calls within policymaking circles to recognise digital assets as a legitimate component of the financial system. The Bank of Japan, for instance, has warned that in a highly digitized society, trust in fiat currency could erode if central banks fail to ensure price stability. According to Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida, in such scenarios, cryptocurrencies or stablecoins could eventually fill the gap, posing a credible alternative to sovereign money in the eyes of future generations. Separately, Japan became one of the first countries to approve a stablecoin license under its updated rules. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, was licensed to handle stablecoins and said it was preparing to support Circle’s USDC.

2025-06-24T16:11:59,"Metaplanet Hits 11,111 BTC Milestone — Follow the Smart Money Into These Crypto Assets","Metaplanet’s milestone of acquiring 11,111 BTC is more than just a number—it’s a signal that institutional conviction in crypto remains strong. As major players quietly accumulate, savvy investors are scanning the horizon for undervalued assets with breakout potential. In this article, we spotlight three crypto projects that mirror the “smart money” logic: fundamentally solid, technically oversold, and primed for explosive upside once momentum shifts. Worldcoin (WLD): Oversold and Ready for a Reversal? Source: tradingview Worldcoin is currently trading between $0.73 and $0.98, reflecting sustained downward pressure—but also creating a potential entry zone for bold investors. While the coin is down over 34% this past month and nearly 60% across six months, the RSI is starting to hint at early buyer interest. A breakout above the $1.13 resistance could trigger a rally toward $1.38, offering a gain of nearly 40% from current levels. As Worldcoin continues pushing its identity-based crypto vision and gains media visibility, a momentum shift could quickly flip the narrative. Oversold assets often make the loudest comebacks—and WLD might just be setting the stage. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): AI Sector Favorite Eyes Next Leg Up Source: tradingview FET is currently trading between $0.51 and $0.70, showing consolidation after a prolonged pullback. Although down over 20% this month and nearly 50% over six months, the RSI at 58 suggests mild bullish momentum building. A push past $0.82 resistance could unlock a move toward $1.01, offering potential upside of up to 60%. As AI continues to dominate both tech and crypto narratives, FET stands out as a leader in decentralized superintelligence. For investors tracking ""smart money"" sectors, AI tokens like FET remain at the top of the watchlist. Ethena (ENA): Deep Discount with High-Reward Potential Source: tradingview Ethena is hovering in a tight band between $0.20 and $0.30 after dropping more than 70% over six months—but this might present a strong accumulation zone. The RSI remains low, hinting at oversold conditions and growing buyer interest. A breakout past $0.35 could spark a rally to $0.45, representing a 50% upside from current prices. As a synthetic dollar project with strong fundamentals and a growing DeFi presence, ENA could be poised for a sharp recovery when market sentiment turns. For those who follow big-picture fundamentals, this may be a low-risk, high-reward setup. Conclusion While Metaplanet sets the tone with bold Bitcoin accumulation, the real alpha may lie in assets still flying under the radar. Worldcoin, FET, and Ethena each offer compelling setups—steep discounts, improving indicators, and alignment with major crypto narratives like AI, identity, and DeFi. As the market shifts from fear to opportunity, these tokens could be next in line for aggressive moves. Smart money isn’t just watching Bitcoin—it’s hunting for the next breakout story.

2025-06-24T16:05:07,"What Tariffs Will — and Won’t — Change for U.S. Bitcoin Miners","Will tariffs end the golden age of bitcoin mining in America? After China banned crypto in the summer of 2021, a huge chunk of the mining industry was forced to relocate — to Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada and other countries with cheap electricity. The biggest beneficiary of this exodus, however, was the United States, which over the last four years has overtaken every other country in the world in terms of hashrate (meaning that more bitcoin is produced in the U.S. than anywhere else). Yet President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, unveiled on April 2 but paused for the time being, threaten to increase the costs of ASICs , the extremely powerful computers used to produce bitcoin. Only a handful of companies know how to build these ASICs, and the majority of their manufacturing facilities are located in Southeast Asia, in nations that face roughly 10% to 50% tariffs. While the new taxes probably won’t make it prohibitively expensive for U.S.-based miners to import new machines, they will likely slow down the industry’s expansion in the country, multiple experts told CoinDesk. “The U.S. is still going to be the major source of hashrate globally for the foreseeable future, but its overarching dominance will likely erode as bitcoin mining becomes a much more global business,” said Taras Kulyk, CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Synteq Digital. “We're certainly going to see U.S. hashrate plateau in terms of relative growth,” he added. “Other countries are coming into the space in a big way. Pakistan just announced it will dedicate two gigawatts of power to bitcoin mining. There are all sorts of projects happening in Ethiopia and abroad. They will certainly take up quite a bit of hashrate capacity growth.” Tariffs are only a piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, such as the enormous demand for new data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and the diminishing number of ideal U.S. locations for firms to set up mining facilities, are likely to have a larger impact on a miner’s calculations when it comes to choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate. U.S.-based operations are still, in the short-term, able to tap into a robust secondary market in order to acquire mining rigs without paying tariffs. In the long-term, ASIC manufacturers are taking steps to produce their machines on U.S. soil. The consensus seems to be that, far from destroying bitcoin mining in the U.S., tariffs are simply shaping up to be a new variable that the quick-moving, hyper-competitive industry has to contend with. Biting the bullet Tariffs mostly presented a challenge to miners in April because of how sudden and steep they were. Miners and logistics companies rushed to push ASIC shipments into the U.S. before the policy’s implementation in order to avoid paying substantial taxes — only for the White House to push the deadline back a few months. Now, however, mining firms have adapted to the idea that imported ASICs will cost at least 10% more than they used to. But there is uncertainty as to whether this is the new normal. The Trump administration is still in the midst of trade negotiations, and the court system has yet to provide a definite ruling on the lawfulness of its new policies. “It’s likely going to take a long time for us to have a definitive answer on what tariffs will look like — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in,” Lauren Lin, head of hardware at bitcoin hardware firm Luxor Technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We expect it to take a few months, even over a year.” In the meantime, Luxor (which also runs a freight-forwarding business) isn’t seeing any signs of panic among its clients, though there has been an uptick in questions on how to prepare for Washington’s policy changes, according to Lin. Nor is the ASIC secondary market (where U.S.-based firms can acquire pre-owned, cheaper machines) slowing down, she said. In other words, miners are plodding along. But there are new difficulties, like the fact that tariffs also impact imported electrical hardware. Transformers, for example, are mostly manufactured overseas and were already difficult to obtain before April. Tariffs have only worsened the situation. This has been a bigger source of frustration for miners than tariffs on ASICs, according to an individual who works for a crypto trade organization. Overall, the White House’s initial tariffs on Southeast Asian nations should only be seen as a starting point for a policy that will likely evolve over time, Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at bitcoin miner Bitdeer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We're pretty optimistic that there'll be a reasonable outcome at the end of this,” he said. Made in America The $30 billion ASIC market is dominated by Bitmain, a Chinese firm whose machines power roughly 80% of Bitcoin’s hashrate , according to TheMinerMag. Its competitors include MicroBT, Canaan and Bitdeer. These companies manufacture the vast majority of their ASICs in Malaysia, Thailand and China, though MicroBT already has at least one facility in Pennsylvania, and Bitmain announced in December that it was launching a new production line in the United States. Canaan has also completed a U.S. trial run, meaning that it now has the capacity to build ASICs in the country if it chooses to. The Trump administration’s tariffs are accomplishing one of their stated objectives (to boost U.S. industry) in that they’re incentivizing these ASIC manufacturers to scale up their operations in the country. Canaan told CoinDesk that, while production in the U.S. is costly, it brings the advantages of being geographically closer to their customers and of reducing supply chain risks. The firm said that it is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with existing U.S.-based manufacturers for its own purposes. MicroBT is also looking into ways to avoid tariffs by ramping up U.S. production. Bitdeer, a new but technologically advanced player in the ASIC scene , is looking at the situation as an opportunity to seize market share from the incumbents. “We'd like to migrate as much as we can to the U.S.,” LaBerge said. “It will take some time to ramp that up.” “Being a manufacturer and a miner gives us tremendous optionality, because we'll always have a home for the rigs that we produce, whether it's in our own data centers or with a third party,” he added. Bitdeer has mining operations in Texas and Ohio, among other locations. The heavyweight, Bitmain, has not communicated new plans to ramp up U.S. production since tariffs were announced in April. But the company will likely want to demonstrate that it’s building in the U.S. in accordance with the Trump administration’s goals, Synteq’s Kulyk said. Bitmain did not respond to a request for comment. In any case, the consensus seems to be that expanding production capacity in the U.S. will be a slow and costly process. “Whether we scale our machine manufacturing in the U.S. depends on our ability to cut costs as well as demand from our U.S. customers. If demand from U.S. customers is low, manufacturing here doesn't make sense,” Canaan told CoinDesk. “In addition, if tariffs on products from Southeast Asia [end up being] low, then we don't necessarily need to build up our manufacturing capabilities in the United States.” The end of a golden age? So miners are quickly adapting to the new reality of tariffs, and ASIC manufacturers look ready to ramp up local production. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s U.S.-based hashrate ( currently worth over 40% of global hashrate ) is unlikely to keep growing as fast as it has in the last four years. For one thing, tariffs do have an impact. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and companies are always looking for ways to cut costs. If the choice is between opening a new mining facility in Texas or in Ontario, tariffs may swing the decision in favour of the latter. More important, however, is the fact that it’s getting harder to find new U.S. locations that meet the necessary requirements for spinning up new bitcoin mining operations. “Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked in the U.S.,” LaBerge said. Not to mention that competition has become more intense. Data centers dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) are popping up all over the country in order to scale AI capabilities, and the industry’s major players — Microsoft, Meta, Google — are deep-pocketed. If a site is suitable for both mining and HPC, the miners are unlikely to win a bidding war. Nor would they necessarily want to. HPC data centers are more complex and capital intensive to build , but they also bring in much higher profits; this has led a number of bitcoin mining firms to diversify into AI. “HPC chasing electrons is the main theme for the next two to 10 years,” Kulyk told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin miners most certainly have targets on their backs for acquisition and consolidation in the space… As a sector, they will likely get eaten or absorbed into overall digital compute.” This phenomenon is likely to stay contained to the U.S. because of the technical sophistication required to build and run HPC centers. Political considerations also play a big part, considering the ongoing AI arms race between the U.S. and China. In other words, bitcoin miners outside of the U.S. won’t be impacted by the rapid growth of the HPC industry the same way. For U.S.-based miners, the path forward may no longer be expanding in terms of megawatts, but in terms of efficiency, according to LaBerge. “If you look at the global hashrate right now… the majority of rigs have an efficiency of 30 joules per terahash (J/TH) or higher,” he said. For comparison, Bitmain and Bitdeer’s latest generation machines are closer to 10 J/TH in efficiency. “In today’s economics, that’s marginally profitable at best.” “All of those rigs need to be refreshed,” he continued. “We see this as a $4-6 billion a year addressable market for the next three to five years.” CORRECTION (June 24, 2025, 16:30 UTC): Canaan isn't looking into building its own U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, as previously stated by the article, but is mulling the idea of partnering with existing U.S. manufacturers.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/06/24/what-tariffs-will-and-wont-change-for-us-bitcoin-miners,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News Analysis|Bitcoin Mining|ASIC|Exclusive|Feature",cryptocompare
