2025-06-24T14:52:34,"Pulte’s FHFA eyes crypto in $8.5 trillion U.S. housing and mortgage markets — what’s next?","What does Pulte’s FHFA crypto mortgage signal actually mean for American homebuyers, and could it rewrite lending norms for those who store wealth in Bitcoin and stablecoins? Table of Contents Mortgage, Pulte, and FHFA enter the crypto conversation Freddie Mac compliance drives lender finance models How crypto might be evaluated Gains in private finance suggest real demand for Bitcoin integration Mortgage, Pulte, and FHFA enter the crypto conversation In a recent announcement, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has publicly stated that the agency will “study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages.” The announcement, posted on X on Jun. 24, introduces the possibility that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets could soon factor into U.S. home loan evaluations. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 The idea comes at a time when housing access remains strained. As of mid-2025, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is just under 7%, the highest level since the mid-2000s. 30-year fixed mortgage rate chart | Source: FRED In May, the median price for an existing home reached $422,800, a record high for the month. Existing home sales have also slowed sharply, with May 2025 marking the weakest pace for that month since 2009. Meanwhile, the affordability squeeze is especially pronounced for first-time buyers. According to the National Association of Realtors, only 30% of home purchases are currently being made by first-time buyers, well below the 40% share considered typical for a balanced market. Rising monthly payments and strict lending criteria have made access difficult for younger buyers and self-employed individuals, particularly those with irregular income but sizable assets. The FHFA is now examining whether crypto holdings could be considered similar to savings, investment portfolios, or other assets during mortgage evaluations. Under such a framework, for example, a person holding $200,000 worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum ( ETH ), but lacking a traditional salary, might still qualify for a loan based on their overall net worth. At present, most mortgage lenders exclude crypto from financial assessments, citing concerns over price volatility, limited regulatory clarity, and the challenges of verifying digital asset ownership. Even high net-worth applicants holding substantial crypto assets are often treated as lacking adequate financial stability under current standards. The FHFA’s announcement does not indicate a finalized policy or regulatory timeline. The review remains in its early stages, and many operational and legal questions will need to be addressed before any change is implemented. Freddie Mac compliance drives lender finance models The FHFA plays a quiet but central role in shaping how Americans access home loans. It oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored entities that guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the United States. It also regulates the Federal Home Loan Bank system, a network of regional banks that provide liquidity to housing and community development lenders. According to the agency’s data, these institutions collectively support over $8.5 trillion in U.S. home financing. Any change in policy issued by the FHFA carries broad market consequences. Updates to guidelines on credit scores, down payments, or eligible asset classes often influence how banks and lenders structure their loan products. Most lending institutions follow FHFA standards to ensure that their mortgages remain eligible for resale to Fannie or Freddie, which helps manage long-term risk exposure. The agency was established in 2008, following the housing market collapse, with a mandate to strengthen oversight and preserve the safety and liquidity of the mortgage finance system. Within that framework, even a preliminary inquiry into counting crypto assets toward mortgage qualifications carries real weight. The agency’s current direction is closely tied to the background of its director, Bill Pulte. Appointed in March 2025 during President Trump ’s second term, Pulte took office after a lengthy confirmation process. He is the grandson of William Pulte, founder of Pulte Homes, one of the largest homebuilders in the country. Before entering public service, Pulte led Pulte Capital, a private investment firm. He also gained a public following through philanthropic giveaways on X, where he became known as the “Twitter Philanthropist.” Unlike his predecessors, Pulte has direct involvement in the crypto space. Financial disclosures show personal holdings of $500,000 to $1 million in Bitcoin, along with a similar-sized position in Solana ( SOL ). He also holds equity in Marathon Digital Holdings, a U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company, and has previously invested in speculative stocks such as GameStop. His profile stands out in a field typically characterized by conservative financial backgrounds. Pulte has publicly supported crypto since 2019, using his social media presence to promote adoption and encourage policy openness toward digital assets. While the FHFA’s review of crypto in mortgage underwriting is still early and exploratory, its very consideration reflects a shift in both the asset class’s relevance and the leadership’s priorities. How crypto might be evaluated Pulte’s announcement has raised fresh questions about how crypto holdings might eventually be evaluated under mortgage lending standards. Currently, borrowers who want to use digital assets in the mortgage process must first convert them into U.S. dollars and deposit the funds into a regulated American bank account. To meet eligibility for down payments or reserves under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, those funds must also be seasoned, meaning they must remain in the account for at least 60 days. The FHFA’s review is expected to examine whether these requirements can or should be updated. One likely area of focus is asset valuation. Due to the volatility of crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, lenders may hesitate to accept their full market value when assessing borrower assets. A common method in traditional finance is to apply a haircut — a discount from the stated value — to account for potential price swings. Whether similar adjustments would be adopted for crypto remains uncertain. Holding history may also come under review. Lenders often view long-held assets more favorably than short-term holdings. Assets with clear documentation, consistent custody, and minimal trading activity may carry more weight than those recently acquired or frequently moved. Stablecoins present a separate set of considerations. Tokens such as USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ) are designed to maintain a consistent value relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make them more suitable for underwriting purposes. Even so, treatment of stablecoins would depend on regulatory comfort with their structure, custody arrangements, and transparency standards. For now, mortgage advisors commonly recommend that crypto holders convert their assets to dollars well in advance of applying for a loan, giving lenders time to verify the source of funds and ensuring the assets meet seasoning requirements. Any future update is likely to preserve strict documentation standards. Borrowers would still need to show a complete audit trail, including wallet ownership, transaction history, and evidence that the funds are not tied to loans or suspicious activity. Verification of custody, clarity of origin, and compliance with anti-money laundering rules are also expected to remain central to any policy changes under consideration. Gains in private finance suggest real demand for Bitcoin integration While federal regulators are just beginning to explore the idea of integrating crypto into mortgage lending, several private fintech firms have already launched experimental models. Milo Credit, a Florida-based lender, introduced one of the first crypto mortgage products in the U.S. in 2022. Its structure departs from the traditional approach. Rather than requiring borrowers to sell crypto and make a cash down payment, Milo allows buyers to pledge digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or certain stablecoins, as collateral. The setup enables clients to finance up to 100% of the home’s value without liquidating their crypto holdings. Similarly, Figure Technologies, a San Francisco fintech company led by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, has explored large-scale crypto-backed mortgage programs, offering loans as high as $20 million using digital assets as security. According to Milo, clients continue to retain ownership of their pledged crypto, which means they can benefit if asset values rise during the mortgage term. Another advantage is tax-related: selling large crypto positions to cover a down payment would typically trigger capital gains taxes. By pledging rather than selling, borrowers avoid those immediate tax events. As of early-2025, Milo reported over $65 million in crypto-collateralized home loans issued. However, these private offerings function outside the federal mortgage system. Their loans are not eligible for resale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, meaning they cannot benefit from the same level of liquidity and risk-sharing that conventional loans do. As a result, interest rates tend to be higher, and lenders often retain the loans in-house or work with alternative investors to fund them. These limitations place a ceiling on how widely such products can scale. Another constraint is risk. Crypto-backed mortgages usually require over-collateralization — meaning borrowers must pledge more in crypto value than the loan amount to offset volatility. But even with that buffer, price swings can present challenges. A drop of 15% in asset value between approval and closing is enough to disrupt a loan. And historically, crypto drawdowns have been far steeper. If the FHFA chooses to move forward, it could bring more consistency and structure to the space. Private models have shown that crypto can be integrated into housing finance, but only with careful safeguards and a full understanding of its tradeoffs. Whether the outcome is adoption, rejection, or something in between, the process will influence how crypto is viewed not just in capital markets, but in everyday financial life.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/pulte-fhfa-crypto-housing-mortgage-move/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Donald Trump|Regulation|United States",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T14:51:30,"Ripple’s XRP Rockets 11%: Is $3 Next After SEC Twist?","The latest price action saw XRP leap from $1.97 to a high of $2.173, posting a 10.5% range and confirming a decisive breakout above the $2 psychological barrier. Volume spiked to 217 million during the late session, nearly three times the average, as buyers overwhelmed sellers and established $2.06 as a new support zone. Technical analysts highlight that XRP has now cleared both the 100-hour moving average and a multi-month bearish trend line, setting up a bullish structure if the $2.13–$2.15 region holds. Whale Transfers and On-Chain Signals On-chain data reveals a flurry of large XRP transfers in recent days. Notably, a whale moved $58 million in XRP to Coinbase, raising fears of a potential selloff. Yet, instead of tanking, XRP’s price held firm—showing “impressive resilience” even as other cryptos struggled amid global tensions. “XRP’s breakout is real—volume, whales, and retail are all in sync. $3 is next if this momentum holds.” — @CryptoDom Analysts suggest this signals a maturing market, with institutional buyers absorbing supply and retail traders undeterred by whale moves. Ripple itself transferred nearly $439 million in XRP to an unknown wallet, sparking debate about the company’s intentions. While some community members worry about transparency, others see these moves as positioning for a potential spot ETF or treasury accumulation, especially as the SEC lawsuit nears a resolution. Ripple v. SEC: Lawsuit Timelines Fuel Sentiment The ongoing Ripple v. SEC case remains a major driver of sentiment. After a recent 60-day pause in appeals, investors are watching for the next round of filings, which could bring long-awaited regulatory clarity. The settlement of this years-long battle has already shifted industry sentiment, with many now betting on an eventual XRP ETF approval and broader institutional adoption. Google Trends and Retail FOMO: “XRP to $3” Goes Viral Retail interest is exploding. Google autocomplete queries for “XRP to $3,” “XRP price prediction,” and “Is XRP a good investment?” have surged in the past week. On January 15, XRP even surpassed Bitcoin in global search volume, a rare feat that underscores the token’s growing mainstream appeal. The “XRP Army” community continues to swell, with 58,000 new holders joining in 2025 and daily active addresses up 490% since 2022. Analyst Outlook: Bulls and Bears Draw Battle Lines Market analysts remain split. Some see a clear path to $3 and beyond, citing strong technicals, whale accumulation, and the prospect of an ETF. Others warn of a possible 25% correction if support at $2.13 fails, especially if whale selling accelerates. For now, the structure remains bullish as long as XRP holds above $2.13–$2.15. The implications go beyond short-term price action. Sustained institutional interest and elevated network activity could set new market dynamics for XRP, potentially supporting its long-term value and reinforcing its position as a leading cross-border payments token. For now, all eyes are on whether this wave of participation can help XRP break through the $2.20–$2.30 resistance and sustain its bullish momentum Bottom Line XRP’s 11% rally to $2.20 is powered by a rare alignment of technical strength, whale accumulation, and surging retail interest. With Ripple’s legal saga nearing its climax and search trends pointing to $3, all eyes are on whether XRP can sustain its momentum—or if another round of volatility is just around the corner.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9688/ripple-s-xrp-rockets-11-is-3-next-after-sec-twist,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Ripple",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T14:46:30,"Capitulation Signs? Ethereum Whale Offloads 5,000 ETH in Panic Move","A flood of sell orders hit Ethereum after a major whale transferred 5,000 ETH—worth about $12 million—to Binance, triggering alarm among analysts who view it as a possible capitulation signal. Blockchain tracker Lookonchain shared the on-chain data on X, noting this whale’s sudden transfer that coincided with a sharp dip in ETH’s price earlier in the day. Such large, abrupt wallet movements often precede heavy sell-offs. ETH source: lookonchain ETH Whale Movement Sparks Concerns The key transaction unfolded shortly before ETH price dropped to as low as $2,240, per CoinGecko data. The seller reportedly retains around $12 million in ETH at press time. While whale offloading is not uncommon, timing and scale often make them noteworthy. According to CoinGlass data, the sell-off catalyzed around $300 million in liquidations across Ethereum derivatives in the past 24 hours. That surge aligns with an 8% fall in ETH’s price this week, marking it among the worst performers by market capitalization. Crypto markets absorbed $712 million in liquidations during the same period. During the rug pull, Bitcoin dominance rose sharply. As Ethereum sold off, BTC held steady, underscoring its status as a relative safe haven amid market distress. ETH/BTC ratio remains above 0.017, but the shift highlights capital rotation toward Bitcoin. This bearish whale action comes alongside record highs in Ethereum derivatives. Glassnode reports ETH futures open interest now tops $20 billion, marking an all-time high leveraged by traders using stablecoin-based contracts. Analysts note that such leverage increases vulnerability—sharp price moves can trigger cascading liquidations. Crypto trader “Credible Crypto” flagged $2,240 as a critical support level; breaking below could prompt a slide toward $2,000–2,100. Ethereum’s next support lies near the low-$2,200s range. A bounce may require robust uptake in spot ETF inflows or institutional accumulation, neither of which has outweighed this wave of liquidations yet. It’s not the first time whale behavior has triggered concern. Lookonchain identified on X a 48,825 ETH purchase (~$127 million), suggesting a contrast between profit-taking and accumulation points in time. The latest transfer, however, aligns more with panic-driven selling. Source: X On-chain sadness and fear may be setting in. But several established whales continue building positions—as many analysts suggested accumulation during pullbacks reflects longer-term confidence. Still, this 5,000 ETH transfer and active liquidations emphasize how leverage can amplify a sell move. What This Means for Traders With futures leverage at record highs and whales fleeing, ETH faces short-term downside risk. But whales also load up during price dips—creating volatility both ways. Traders need to monitor exchange inflows and outflows, futures liquidations, and BTC ratio for clues.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/capitulation-signs-ethereum-whale-offloads-5000-eth-in-panic-move/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T14:40:30,"XRP Ledger Validator Predicts Timeline for XRP to Hit $11 to $13","A prominent XRP Ledger validator and crypto analyst known as Sugar has captured the attention of the XRP community with a striking new forecast: XRP is poised to reach a top between $11.33 and $13.83 within the next 30 to 40 days , though the timeline may extend into the end of August. In a recent post on X, Sugar declared that this is the moment XRP holders have been waiting for, calling it a “now or never” scenario for the digital asset. A Bold Prediction Backed by Market Momentum Sugar’s prediction hinges on one critical factor: a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs . According to him, if Bitcoin can break past its current resistance and set new highs, it would likely trigger a wave of capital rotation into altcoins, a common pattern seen during bullish market cycles. In this scenario, XRP could benefit immensely and finally catch up to the broader market’s momentum. This kind of explosive rally would represent a 500%+ increase from XRP’s current trading range near $2. The validator believes this run-up would not only signal a major altcoin season but also position XRP among the top performers, finally delivering the price action many long-term holders have anticipated for years. Ok, you all have asked so here it is. The top for $XRP will be $11.33-$13.83. I would like to see this achieved in the next 30-40 days but it can extend in to the end of August.

With global market sentiment improving and crypto-friendly momentum growing, especially amid regulatory developments, this may be XRP’s best shot at achieving its long-promised breakout. “This is the moment,” Sugar wrote. “If $BTC breaks out to new highs, then the altcoin market should follow.” He added that although he expects to see this move within a month or so, he would allow for an extension into late August if market conditions take longer to align. Notably, he has promised to share detailed charts and technical reasoning behind his prediction soon, further building anticipation among traders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Legal Case and Market Sentiment This forecast also arrives at a critical moment in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As both parties work toward finalizing a penalty settlement , the outcome could have significant implications for XRP’s market trajectory. A favorable resolution may remove one of the biggest overhangs affecting XRP’s price for years. Institutional interest is also picking up, following recent moves by U.S. regulators that have made crypto access slightly more favorable for banks. Combined with Ripple’s continued push for enterprise adoption, including its rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin, market conditions appear more supportive than ever. All Eyes on Bitcoin, and Sugar’s Charts While Sugar has not yet shared the technical analysis supporting his $11–$13 XRP projection, his reputation as a trusted validator and market commentator has given his words significant weight. The community now waits to see the charts he plans to publish, which could offer more clarity into the pattern or fractal analysis he’s using to justify such a target. Until then, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s next move. Should BTC break to new highs, XRP may indeed ride the wave — possibly straight into double digits.

2025-06-24T14:40:11,"Trump Iran News: De-escalation Triumph? Assessing the Aftermath of Missile Retaliation","BitcoinWorld Trump Iran News: De-escalation Triumph? Assessing the Aftermath of Missile Retaliation The world often holds its breath when geopolitical tensions escalate, and the financial markets, including the ever-dynamic cryptocurrency space, feel every ripple. When news emerged of Iran’s missile retaliation following the U.S. strike on Qasem Soleimani, global investors braced for impact. However, U.S. President Donald Trump’s immediate response offered a surprising turn, shaping not just immediate reactions but also the long-term outlook for global stability and various asset classes. This incident, as reported by JinSe Finance, provides a fascinating case study in how political rhetoric can swiftly alter market sentiment and the perception of risk. Trump Iran News: Did Advance Warning Avert a Crisis? In the wake of Iran’s missile strikes, President Donald Trump addressed the nation, delivering a message that swiftly eased widespread fears of a full-blown war. He characterized Iran’s retaliation as “weak” and “ineffective,” highlighting that out of 14 missiles launched, 13 were intercepted, resulting in no U.S. casualties and only minor damage to an airbase. But perhaps the most striking detail, and one that quickly became a focal point of analysis, was Trump’s direct acknowledgement: he “thanked Iran for advance notice.” This seemingly casual remark carried immense weight. It suggested a pre-arranged understanding, a carefully orchestrated move by Iran to save face domestically while avoiding a direct, escalatory confrontation with the United States. This “advance notice” allowed U.S. forces to take precautionary measures, ensuring the safety of personnel and minimizing potential damage. In essence, it transformed a moment of potential crisis into a controlled, symbolic act of retaliation, preventing a wider, more destructive conflict. This immediate de-escalation was a critical turning point, profoundly impacting global markets and setting a precedent for managing future international disputes. What Was the True Geopolitical Impact Beyond Initial Fears? The initial hours following the missile strikes were fraught with uncertainty. Global markets reacted instinctively: oil prices surged, stock futures plummeted, and traditional safe-haven assets like gold saw significant gains. There was a palpable sense that the Middle East was on the brink of a major conflict. However, once President Trump’s measured response became clear, and the reality of the limited damage and lack of casualties sank in, the immediate panic subsided almost as quickly as it began. The true geopolitical impact of this event, therefore, was less about direct military escalation and more about the demonstration of a delicate, albeit dangerous, dance between two powerful adversaries. It showcased that even amidst intense animosity, channels for de-escalation and communication can exist, whether overt or covert. While the underlying tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and indeed across the broader Middle East, remained unresolved, this specific incident proved that both sides, at that moment, preferred to avoid an all-out war. This provided a temporary reprieve for global stability, allowing markets to rebound and focus on other economic fundamentals, rather than immediate conflict. Key Takeaways from the Incident: Avoided Direct Escalation: The most significant outcome was the prevention of a larger military conflict. Informal Communication Channels: The “advance notice” highlighted the existence of back-channel communications. Brief Market Jitters: Financial markets reacted sharply but recovered quickly, demonstrating resilience. Underlying Tensions Remain: Despite de-escalation, the fundamental geopolitical friction in the region persists. Can Middle East Stability Be Achieved Amidst Ongoing Tensions? President Trump’s statement went beyond merely acknowledging the missile strike; he also expressed hope for regional peace and stated his intention to encourage Israel to pursue the same. This highlights the intricate web of relationships and conflicts that define Middle East stability . The region is a geopolitical chessboard, with numerous state and non-state actors vying for influence, often through proxy conflicts and ideological battles. From the ongoing civil war in Syria to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, true stability remains an elusive goal. The incident with Iran, while contained, serves as a stark reminder of how quickly regional flashpoints can escalate and impact global affairs, including energy markets and international trade routes. For investors, understanding the dynamics of Middle East stability is crucial, as sustained peace can foster investor confidence, encouraging investment in risk-on assets, while instability can trigger flights to safety. Trump’s call for broader regional peace, while ambitious, underscores the global desire to mitigate risks emanating from this volatile but strategically vital part of the world. How Do Geopolitical Shocks Drive Market Volatility? Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major global powers or critical regions, are potent drivers of market volatility . The immediate aftermath of the Iran missile strikes perfectly illustrated this phenomenon. As news broke, investors reacted by shedding riskier assets and flocking to perceived safe havens. This rapid reallocation of capital leads to sharp price swings across various asset classes. The interconnectedness of global financial systems means that a crisis in one region can send shockwaves worldwide. For the cryptocurrency market, while often touted as uncorrelated with traditional finance, significant geopolitical events can still have a profound impact. Bitcoin, for instance, frequently experiences price movements in response to global uncertainty. During the initial fear surrounding the Iran incident, Bitcoin saw a brief surge, mirroring gold’s performance, as some investors sought alternatives to traditional fiat currencies and stock markets. However, its high volatility also means that these gains can be short-lived once the immediate crisis subsides or de-escalation occurs. Understanding this interplay is vital for crypto investors looking to navigate turbulent times. Market Reactions During the Iran-U.S. Tensions: Event Traditional Market Reaction (Initial) Cryptocurrency Market Reaction (Bitcoin) U.S. Strike on Soleimani Stocks down, Oil prices up, Gold up Bitcoin price surged Iran Missile Retaliation Stocks down, Oil prices up, Gold up (briefly) Bitcoin price surged (briefly) Trump’s De-escalation Speech Stocks recovered, Oil prices down, Gold down Bitcoin price retreated from peak Are Safe-Haven Assets Like Bitcoin a True Sanctuary in Crisis? The concept of safe-haven assets becomes particularly relevant during periods of geopolitical uncertainty. Traditionally, assets like gold, the U.S. dollar, and certain government bonds are considered safe havens, as they are expected to retain or increase in value during market downturns. In recent years, Bitcoin has increasingly been discussed in this context, with proponents arguing it acts as a “digital gold” due to its decentralized nature and limited supply. During the Iran crisis, Bitcoin’s initial price surge reinforced this narrative for many. However, its relatively young history and inherent volatility mean that its status as a true safe haven is still debated. While it can offer a hedge against traditional financial systems, it is also susceptible to its own market dynamics and speculative trading. For investors, the actionable insight is clear: while cryptocurrencies might offer diversification and a potential hedge against certain risks, relying solely on them as a safe haven without understanding their unique risk profile can be precarious. A balanced portfolio, considering both traditional and digital assets, remains the most prudent approach during times of global uncertainty. A Compelling Conclusion: Navigating an Interconnected World The Iran missile incident, and President Trump’s subsequent response, served as a powerful reminder of the intricate dance between geopolitics, diplomacy, and global financial markets. What began as a moment of intense fear quickly transitioned into a cautious de-escalation, largely due to perceived advance warnings and measured reactions from both sides. While the immediate threat of a wider conflict receded, the underlying complexities and tensions in the Middle East persist, continually influencing global economic sentiment. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, such events underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world. Geopolitical shifts, market volatility, and the evolving role of assets like Bitcoin as potential safe havens are all part of a larger narrative. Staying informed, understanding the nuanced reactions of various asset classes, and maintaining a diversified and adaptable investment strategy are paramount in navigating an increasingly unpredictable global landscape. The quest for Middle East stability continues, and with it, the ripple effects across all facets of the global economy.

2025-06-24T14:40:00,"Andy Konwinski’s Visionary $100M Pledge Fuels Independent AI Research Through Laude Institute","BitcoinWorld Andy Konwinski’s Visionary $100M Pledge Fuels Independent AI Research Through Laude Institute In a truly transformative move poised to reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence, Andy Konwinski , a visionary co-founder behind tech giants Databricks and Perplexity AI , has announced a monumental $100 million pledge for his new venture, Laude Institute . This bold initiative aims to inject fresh capital and independent thought into the burgeoning field of AI research , promising a new era for innovation that prioritizes beneficial outcomes over purely commercial gains. For those invested in the future of technology and its ethical development, Konwinski’s commitment marks a pivotal moment. Andy Konwinski’s Vision: Catalyzing Independent AI Research Andy Konwinski , a computer scientist with a formidable track record, has always been at the forefront of technological advancement. His co-founding roles at Databricks , a leader in big data analytics and AI, and Perplexity AI , a revolutionary conversational answer engine, speak volumes about his foresight. On Monday, Konwinski unveiled his personal company, Laude, is forming a new AI research institute, backed by a significant $100 million of his own money. This isn’t just another lab; the Laude Institute is structured more like a fund, making investments akin to grants, designed to empower researchers without the immediate pressures of commercialization. The institute’s board boasts an impressive lineup of academic and industry luminaries: Dave Patterson: A UC Berkeley professor renowned for his award-winning research in computer architecture. Jeff Dean: Known globally as Google’s chief scientist, a titan in AI development. Joelle Pineau: Meta’s vice president of AI Research, bringing deep expertise from a major tech player. The Laude Institute has already made its first significant commitment: a flagship grant of $3 million per year for five years. This substantial funding will anchor the new AI Systems Lab at UC Berkeley, a lab set to open in 2027 and led by the celebrated Ion Stoica. Stoica, also a co-founder of Anyscale and Databricks, both born from Berkeley’s lab system, brings invaluable experience to this new endeavor. This foundational grant underscores Laude’s commitment to fostering deep, impactful AI research at leading academic institutions. The Laude Institute: A New Paradigm for AI Advancement Konwinski articulated the Laude Institute’s core mission in his blog post, describing it as “built by and for computer science researchers … We exist to catalyze work that doesn’t just push the field forward but guides it towards more beneficial outcomes.” This statement is a subtle yet pointed commentary on the current landscape of AI development, where many organizations, including those that started with noble research goals like OpenAI, have arguably become consumed by their commercial ambitions. The institute’s structure is unique, operating across boundaries as a nonprofit with a public benefit corporation arm. Konwinski is strategically dividing his research investments into two distinct categories: Slingshots: These are geared towards early-stage research projects that can benefit from grants and hands-on support, providing the initial push for promising ideas. Moonshots: As the name suggests, these are long-horizon labs tackling “species-level challenges” such as AI for scientific discovery, civic discourse, healthcare, and workforce reskilling. This bucket aims for truly groundbreaking, long-term impact. For instance, Laude has already collaborated with “terminal-bench,” a Stanford-led benchmark designed to assess how well AI agents handle tasks, a tool actively utilized by companies like Anthropic. This demonstrates a practical approach to fostering foundational tools that benefit the wider AI research community. Beyond Profit: The Imperative for Ethical AI Research The increasing commercialization of AI has led to a muddled research environment. We’ve seen a proliferation of AI benchmarks designed to prove that a particular vendor’s model works best, rather than objectively measuring progress. Even major players like Salesforce have developed their own LLM benchmarks for CRMs, highlighting a trend where research often serves commercial interests. A recent controversy involving popular AI researcher Epoch, which revealed OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks used to unveil its new o3 model, further illustrates this blurred line. The founder of Epoch also launched a startup with the controversial mission to replace all human workers everywhere with AI agents. These examples underscore the urgent need for truly independent AI research that is not swayed by commercial pressures or profit motives. This is where an alliance like the one Konwinski is forging, with the likes of Jeff Dean and Ion Stoica, becomes critically important. Their support for independent research could lead to innovations that are genuinely “human-helpful” and foster a more ethical, beneficial path for AI development. This initiative presents an attractive alternative to the often-conflicted models currently dominating the space. The Financial Backbone: Success of Databricks and Perplexity AI Many might wonder how Andy Konwinski amassed the fortune necessary to pledge a staggering $100 million to this new endeavor. The answer lies in the phenomenal success of his previous ventures, particularly Databricks and Perplexity AI . In January, Databricks closed a funding round that valued the company at an astounding $62 billion, a testament to its pivotal role in the big data and AI landscape. Similarly, Perplexity AI secured a $14 billion valuation just last month, solidifying its position as a major player in conversational AI. It is important to note that Konwinski’s company, Laude, isn’t solely a grant-writing research institute. He also co-founded a for-profit venture fund, launched in 2024, with former NEA VC Pete Sonsini. This fund has quietly backed other startups and notably led a $12 million investment in AI agent infrastructure startup Arcade, as previously reported by Bitcoin World. A spokesperson for Laude confirmed that while Konwinski has pledged the initial $100 million, he is also actively seeking and open to additional investment from other successful technologists, signaling a broader vision for the fund’s impact. Why Laude Matters: Shaping the Future of AI In a world grappling with the rapid advancements of artificial intelligence, a pertinent question arises: does the world truly need yet another AI “good for humanity” research institute, especially one with a potentially murky nonprofit/commercial structure? The answer is both no, and emphatically yes. While the landscape of AI research has become increasingly muddled with commercial interests, the unique structure and clear mission of the Laude Institute offer a refreshing counter-narrative. By bringing together a formidable alliance of minds like Konwinski, Dean, and Stoica, Laude is poised to champion truly independent research. This independence is crucial for developing unbiased benchmarks, exploring ethical implications, and ensuring that AI innovations ultimately serve humanity rather than just corporate bottom lines. The potential for this initiative to foster genuinely independent, human-centric commerce and innovation is immense. Konwinski’s substantial pledge and the institute’s focus on “Slingshots” and “Moonshots” could ignite breakthroughs that address species-level challenges, steering the powerful currents of AI towards more beneficial outcomes for society as a whole. It’s an exciting prospect for anyone hoping for a more responsible and impactful future for AI.

Here Are the Details","Japan-based technology firm Metaplanet announced today that it will make a $5 billion capital contribution to its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, subject to board approval. The move is considered an important part of the company’s global expansion strategy. $5 Billion Capital Move from Metaplanet to the US: Global Growth Accelerates Metaplanet, which announced last month that it had established a U.S.-based subsidiary in Miami, Florida, is positioning the new structure as the centerpiece of its “aggressive global growth” plans. The company said the initial capitalization phase has been completed and it is now moving into the expansion phase. “As we continue to lead institutional Bitcoin adoption in Japan, our U.S. expansion demonstrates our commitment to establishing an integrated treasury model on a global scale,” Metaplanet said in a statement. The company said the new $5 billion contribution is planned to be financed through the use of share purchase rights. Bitcoin Stands Out With Its Strategy Metaplanet draws attention with the Bitcoin accumulation strategy it adopted in April 2024. Believing that this strategy will create shareholder value in the long term, the company purchased an additional 1,111 BTC earlier this week, increasing its treasury assets to a total of 11,111 BTC. With this figure, Metaplanet became the eighth largest institutional Bitcoin holder in the world, just 398 BTC behind Tesla (according to bitcointreasuries.net data). Metaplanet stated that the impact of the capital contribution on the current fiscal year will be limited, and emphasized that important developments will be shared with the public in a transparent manner. Despite the capital move and BTC purchase, markets have seen mixed reactions. Metaplanet’s shares traded on OTC Markets in the US (MTPLF) fell 5.9% to $11.64 on Monday, while its shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 6.36% as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Google Finance data. This move by Metaplanet sets an important example not only for cryptocurrency strategies but also for Japanese technology companies seeking global growth. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T14:38:47,"US Federal Reserve Drops ‘Reputational Risk’ Requirements for Banks, Ending Era of Crypto Debanking","The US Federal Reserve announced that it will no longer use ‘reputation risk’ to assess banks, ending a practice closely connected to the ‘war on crypto’ and debanking . Reputation risk was used to pressure US banks to reject crypto startups from receiving banking services such as business loans. The status quo has changed in Washington, giving banks the autonomy to make their risk assessments. The Federal Reserve announced that they were combing through their documentation to replace the term ‘reputation risk’ with more specific examples of ‘financial risk’. The Federal Reserve added that they were still committed to risk assessment and desired banks to follow sound principles. The Fed defined reputational risk as including aspects of negative publicity that hurt a business’s bottom line or lead to costly litigation procedures. The Fed has now removed the term from its documents and training manuals, focusing on more specific types of risk instead. The Office of the Comptroller and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation both dropped ‘reputational risk’ as an item of assessment. Banks have long disputed the measure as introducing subjective metrics that can be abused by federal organisations and can lead to inaccurate assessments of what could otherwise be legitimate investments. The Fed still expects banks to conduct responsible risk assessment examinations. Banks can still employ ‘reputation risk’ assessments if they believe the methods are valid. Banks are still expected to use robust risk management methods. The Federal Reserve still sees risk assessment as a vital methodology that prevents financial crises from happening. The crypto industry is set to benefit from the new developments because ‘reputation risk’ was used to bludgeon the industry into submission. The Fed has decided instead to focus on sound risk assessment methods rather than methods that prioritise risk perceptions. Banks can now focus on hard data and statistics to judge crypto partnerships, rather than concentrating on vibes and social media trends. Crypto businesses may thrive under these new conditions because they can take out more loans and take measured risks in their business practices. Crypto startups can enjoy traditional banking services when exploring new ways to make money from blockchain innovations. The central bank is under incredible pressure from the Trump administration to get the economy back on track. Under the previous administration, the Fed had to micromanage the banking industry based on subjective measures that were hard to implement. The result was a ‘war against crypto’ and discriminatory practices against entire swathes of the US economy. Under President Trump, banks can now decide whether subjective reputation measures are appropriate on a case-by-case basis. President Trump has taken an aggressive stance against the Fed, calling the chairman a “moron” and demanding that the central bank comply with his wishes. Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell met in the Oval Office. Trump insisted that Powell reduce interest rates from over 4% to 1% so that he could finance US debt at a cheaper rate. Powell has defended the actions of the Fed by stating that the central bank also wants to support a strong US economy. Meanwhile, Trump has said that he will blame Powell for any future economic crises after his decisions. TradFi and the broader cryptocurrency market will benefit from surviving the debanking era, which thwarted the industry’s efforts to scale crypto tokens. Banks can assess crypto projects more objectively and have a better chance of profiting from US innovations. Many banks are already interested in crypto projects and will benefit from the changes immediately. Web3 innovations are taking off recently and will benefit from the changes, especially because many traditional institutions may not have the technical expertise to understand these new technologies. Operation Choke Point was part of the debanking movement to destroy crypto startups. However, Bitcoin was designed to withstand American corruption, especially about machinations from the central bank and public-private corruption in the banking industry. Despite efforts by specific organisations, cryptocurrencies survived a turbulent time and became more robust.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/us-federal-reserve-drops-reputational-risk-requirements-for-banks-ending-era-of-crypto-debanking/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Banks|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T14:35:31,"Excellent Crypto News Coming from the US Federal Reserve","The US Federal Reserve Board stated on Monday that it is eliminating “reputational risk” as a supervisory tool for banks. The move could potentially open the digital doors for crypto companies that have faced challenges dealing with banks. Reputational risk was often cited as justification for banks to avoid crypto-related businesses. The US House Committee on Financial Services applauded the move, adding that it was directly aligned with a bill to limit bureaucratic overreach. The Committee applauds the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to no longer consider reputational risk as a component of bank supervision exams. This decision directly aligns with Subcommittee Chairman @RepAndyBarr ’s FIRM Act which advanced out of Committee in May. https://t.co/2GXqbdPEhL — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) June 23, 2025 Clearing The Path For Crypto The US central bank stated that its Board has started the process of “reviewing and removing references to reputation and reputational risk from its supervisory materials, including examination manuals.” The Fed has now joined other American bank regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in moving to drop the examination standard. Reputational risk was seen as a major driver of debanking as financial instutions took this into account when evaluating a client’s suitability for access to their services. It also proved a major hurdle for crypto companies and organizations under the Biden administration, which was at war with the industry with Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and similar politicized weapons. More than 30 crypto and tech companies were denied US banking services following the 2023 crypto bank collapses, creating industry-wide banking access problems under Biden’s Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This is “clearing the path for banks to work with crypto without fear of getting flagged for it,” said Bitcoin OG Kyle Chassé. In February, Representative Dan Meuser and other lawmakers sent a letter to the FDIC calling for clearer digital asset rules and anti-debanking measures. Debanking continues globally Debanking is when banks close or restrict access to accounts for individuals or organizations they consider to pose a financial, legal, or reputational risk. They can target a complete industry, such as crypto, or individuals who make transactions with crypto exchanges. Debanking is particularly prevalent in third-world countries where citizens often struggle to produce the raft of KYC documentation banks demand these days. This was one of the reasons that crypto was created: to cut out the middleman (the bank) and transact peer-to-peer. However, more than 15 years after Bitcoin was activated, banks still rule the roost.

Jérôme Segura, the senior director of research at the antivirus firm Malwarebytes, says the criminals use sponsored search results on Google to trick people looking for 24/7 support for Apple, Bank of America, Facebook, HP, Microsoft, Netflix and PayPal. The fake advertisements take people to copycat websites that imitate the sites of those big brands mentioned above. Instead of posting a real tech support phone number, the sites direct people to call scam numbers, Segura explains. “The browser address bar will show that of the legitimate site, and so there’s no reason for suspicion. However, the information the visitor sees will be misleading, because the search results have been poisoned to display the scammer’s number prominently in what looks like an official search result. Once the number is called, the scammers will pose as the brand with the aim of getting their victim to hand over personal data or card details, or even allow remote access to their computer. In the case of Bank of America or PayPal, the scammers want access to their victim’s financial account so they can empty it of money.” Source: Malwarebytes Segura warns that people seeking tech support online should be aware of various scam warning signs, like a phone number in the URL and encoded characters like the %20 (space) and %2B (+ sign), along with phone numbers. The malware researcher also says people should look out for websites that display urgent language like “Call Now,” “Account suspended,” and “Emergency support,” as well as similarly urgent language in the address bar of the browser.

2025-06-24T14:30:52,"Stablecoin Regulation: Pivotal House Showdown Looms Over Trump’s Urgent Push","BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Regulation: Pivotal House Showdown Looms Over Trump’s Urgent Push The digital finance world is abuzz with a crucial legislative showdown unfolding in Washington. Despite a strong, public push from former President Donald Trump to swiftly pass a stablecoin bill , the House of Representatives is signaling a more measured and deliberative approach. This isn’t just about a single piece of legislation; it’s about setting the foundational framework for how digital assets will be governed in the United States, impacting everything from everyday transactions to global financial stability. The debate highlights the complex challenges inherent in crafting effective stablecoin regulation that balances innovation with consumer protection and systemic risk management. Why is Stablecoin Regulation Such a Critical Topic Right Now? Stablecoins, digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar, have emerged as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They facilitate trading, enable fast and low-cost international transfers, and are increasingly seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized applications. However, their rapid growth and potential for widespread adoption have raised concerns among policymakers. Regulators worry about potential runs similar to bank runs, illicit finance, and the broader implications for financial stability if a major stablecoin were to fail. This makes comprehensive stablecoin regulation not just a matter of convenience, but one of national economic interest. The urgency for clear rules has been amplified by past market volatility and the increasing institutional interest in digital assets. Without a robust regulatory framework, the U.S. risks falling behind other nations that are actively developing their own digital asset policies, potentially ceding its leadership in financial innovation. The Battle of the Bills: GENIUS Act vs. STABLE Act – What Are the Key Differences? At the heart of the current legislative debate lies a fascinating divergence between two prominent proposals: the Senate-approved GENIUS Act and the House’s own conceptual framework, often referred to as the STABLE Act . While both aim to regulate stablecoins, their approaches differ significantly, leading to the current legislative impasse. House Financial Services Chair French Hill has pointed to several key distinctions that demand further discussion before any bill can move forward. Key Points of Contention: Oversight Roles: One of the primary differences lies in which regulatory bodies would have primary oversight. The Senate’s GENIUS Act might lean towards a certain agency, while the House’s STABLE Act could propose a different lead regulator or a more fragmented approach involving multiple agencies. This determines who holds the power and how enforcement would be structured. Extraterritoriality: How would U.S. stablecoin regulations apply to foreign entities or transactions occurring outside U.S. borders? This is a complex legal and geopolitical question. The scope of extraterritoriality in the proposed stablecoin bill frameworks has significant implications for global crypto markets and international cooperation. Corporate Stablecoin Issuance: The rules around who can issue stablecoins, particularly large corporations, are another major point of contention. Some proposals might favor traditional financial institutions, while others might allow a broader range of entities, including tech giants, to issue their own stablecoins. This touches upon issues of competition, systemic risk, and financial inclusion. These aren’t minor technicalities; they represent fundamental disagreements about the philosophy and scope of digital asset governance. Getting these details right is crucial for the long-term health and stability of the digital economy. The House Stablecoin Stance: A Call for Deliberation, Not Haste While former President Trump has publicly urged for a “clean” and rapid passage of the Senate’s version of the stablecoin bill by August, the mood within the House is decidedly more cautious. Representative French Hill’s statements clearly indicate that the House Financial Services Committee is not prepared to rubber-stamp the Senate’s legislation without significant scrutiny and potential modifications. This deliberate approach underscores the complexities involved in creating effective House stablecoin policy. Hill emphasized ongoing talks with House leadership and declined to commit to passing the Senate bill unchanged. This suggests that the House is keen on ensuring any final legislation reflects their specific concerns regarding market integrity, consumer protection, and the competitive landscape. The need for consensus within the House, especially across different factions and political parties, means that a swift, unamended passage is unlikely. Unpacking the GENIUS Act: What’s the Senate’s Vision for Stablecoin Regulation? The GENIUS Act , having passed the Senate, represents that chamber’s attempt to provide a framework for stablecoins. While specific details of its public version might vary, it generally aims to bring stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella, likely focusing on reserve requirements, redemption mechanisms, and oversight to prevent market instability. The Senate’s intent is to provide clarity and foster innovation within a regulated environment. However, the House’s hesitation implies that the GENIUS Act may not adequately address all their concerns. Perhaps it doesn’t grant enough power to a specific regulator, or it might not sufficiently mitigate risks associated with large-scale corporate issuance. The ongoing discussions suggest that the House believes a more robust or differently structured approach to stablecoin regulation is necessary to fully safeguard the financial system and consumers. The Broader Landscape: Will Stablecoin Regulation Merge with Comprehensive Crypto Legislation? Beyond the immediate differences over stablecoin specifics, lawmakers are also reportedly considering a more expansive approach: merging the current stablecoin bill efforts with broader crypto legislation . This potential move could be a game-changer for the entire digital asset industry in the United States. A comprehensive crypto bill would aim to establish clear rules for a wide range of digital assets beyond just stablecoins, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Such an encompassing piece of crypto legislation could address critical issues like: Asset Classification: Defining whether a digital asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely, which determines which regulatory body has jurisdiction (e.g., SEC, CFTC). Market Structure: Rules for crypto exchanges, brokers, and custodians. Consumer Protection: Safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and insolvency. Taxation: Clear guidelines for how digital asset transactions are taxed. Innovation: Creating a regulatory sandbox or framework that encourages technological advancement without compromising safety. While combining these efforts could lead to a holistic and coherent regulatory environment, it also presents significant challenges. Crafting a single, all-encompassing bill for such a diverse and rapidly evolving sector is incredibly complex and time-consuming. It requires extensive collaboration and compromise across different political ideologies and regulatory philosophies. The risk is that trying to do too much at once could lead to further delays, leaving the industry in continued uncertainty. What’s Next for Stablecoins and Digital Assets in the U.S.? The path forward for a federal stablecoin bill , and potentially broader crypto legislation , remains uncertain. The August timeline pushed by former President Trump appears increasingly ambitious given the House’s desire for thorough review and potential revisions. The coming months will be crucial as discussions intensify between House leadership, committee chairs, and potentially the Senate. The outcome will depend on the ability of lawmakers to find common ground on fundamental issues like regulatory oversight, the scope of U.S. jurisdiction, and the role of corporate stablecoins. For stablecoin issuers and users, this means continued vigilance and adaptability. The eventual legislation will shape how these digital currencies operate, impacting everything from compliance costs to market access. For the broader crypto industry, the direction of this debate will signal the U.S.’s commitment to fostering innovation versus prioritizing strict control. The stakes are high, and the decisions made now will resonate for years to come. A Pivotal Moment for Digital Finance The ongoing debate surrounding the stablecoin bill is a testament to the complex and evolving nature of digital finance. It’s a critical juncture where political will meets technological innovation. While the immediate goal is to establish clear rules for stablecoins, the larger aspiration is to create a regulatory environment that fosters growth, protects consumers, and maintains financial stability in the digital age. The journey to comprehensive stablecoin regulation is fraught with challenges, but the eventual clarity it promises is vital for the mainstream adoption and long-term success of digital assets in the U.S. and globally.

2025-06-24T14:30:20,"Japan’s FSA proposes adding crypto to its Financial Instruments Act framework","On Tuesday, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) proposed a set of rules classifying crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act as early as 2026. The initiative aims to shift cryptocurrencies from their current classification as a means of settlement under the Payment Services Act. The plan is to be reviewed by the Financial System Council on June 25. The agency aims to legalize Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and replace the current progressive tax of 55% with a flat 20% on crypto gains. Japan’s FSA seeks to revise its oversight over crypto service providers The FSA said it intends to implement stricter regulations on companies involved in crypto investments to register with financial authorities. The regulatory change also comes amid a rise in reports of cryptocurrency-related scams. As of April 2025, Japan has been developing its legal and tax regimes for crypto assets. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s Web3 Project Team has proposed the classification of digital assets as a distinct asset under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). A Financial Services Agency (FSA) survey on investor attitudes found that 7.3% of domestic investors with prior investment experience hold crypto assets, a rate higher than those holding positions in FX trading or corporate bonds. According to the FSA, the proposed changes will align cryptocurrencies with regulations for stocks and other traditional financial instruments. The entity also revealed that it will amend the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to implement the changes. The amendments to the PSA include the relaxation of reserve requirements for stablecoins. The current regulations require issuers of stablecoins to hold the full issuance value in demand deposits and similar highly liquid instruments. The amendment will permit issuers to manage up to 50% of the issuance value in low-risk assets with minimal risk of principal damage. The other amendment to the PSA will be establishing a new electronic payment crypto asset service system. The existing framework subjects entities acting solely as intermediaries between crypto-asset exchange service providers and users to stringent registration requirements applicable to fully-fledged exchange providers. The amendment will introduce a new category for intermediaries who do not take custody of customer assets. According to the FSA, the intermediaries will focus exclusively on facilitating transactions by connecting users seeking to buy, sell, or exchange crypto assets with registered crypto exchange service providers or electronic payment service providers. The FSA also proposed to allow regulatory authorities to issue an order mandating that a business provider’s assets be held within Japan. The amendment aims to prevent cross-border outflow of customer assets in the event of insolvency of a crypto exchange or electronic payment service provider dealing only in spot transactions. Japan’s shift comes amid a larger initiative among regulatory agencies to shift their approach to governing digital assets. In March, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) said digital asset derivatives will now receive the same regulatory treatment as other products. Regulatory agencies shift their approach to governing crypto In the same period, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued new guidance allowing financial institutions under its supervision to engage in crypto-related activities without FDIC approval, as long as they adequately manage the associated risks. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.” -Travis Hill, Acting Chairman of the FDIC Board of Directors. The agency also expects to issue additional guidance to clarify banks’ engagement in particular crypto-related activities. The FDIC also hopes to collaborate with other banking agencies to provide further guidance or regulations to replace the current interagency documents covering crypto assets. Acting Controller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood mentioned that the OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls to support new bank activities as they do for traditional ones. He believes the initiative will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that their activities are treated consistently by the OCC.

2025-06-24T14:20:54,"Top Altcoins to Buy Now as Pompliano’s ProCap Announced $1B Merger after $750M Raise","Anthony Pompliano, the well-known crypto investor and founder of ProCap, just dropped a bombshell. He’s raised $750 million to merge with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The result? A new publicly traded entity called ProCap Financial Inc. (trading under ticker $CCCM), with $1 billion worth of Bitcoin on its books. The raise includes $516.5M in equity and $235M in convertible notes, backed by a serious who’s-who of crypto venture firms: Arrington Capital, RK Capital, Anson Funds, FalconX, and heavy-hitting individuals like Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital and Eight Sleep CEO Matteo Franceschetti. Pompliano broke the news on X , stating that the firm’s mission is to acquire more $BTC and roll out a new wave of crypto-native financial products. Read on to explore what this means for Bitcoin’s future — and discover the top altcoins poised to ride the wave of growing institutional adoption. Growing Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin Columbus Circle Capital Corp. is among the growing list of institutions that have turned to Bitcoin as a reserve strategy. This whole shift was triggered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, who now owns 592,345 $BTC . Behind this is Marathon Digital Holdings with 46,374 BTC. Currently, only seven institutions hold $BTC worth more than $1B, including Musk’s Tesla. This would make $CCCM the 8th largest holder of Bitcoin currently. As per reports, Trump Media, a conglomerate backed by President Donald Trump, is also planning to add $2.5B worth of $BTC to its portfolio . As the institutional adoption and push for Bitcoin is at its peak, this is the best time to take some long-term bets on the ‘digital gold.’ Here are some cryptocurrencies that can bring in sizable returns as Bitcoin nears an all-time high again. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer-2 Revolutionizing the OG Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is possibly the most exciting new cryptocurrency project going around right now. That’s because it plans to revolutionize Bitcoin, the OG blockchain, by creating a Layer 2 on it that facilitates fast and cheap transactions, as well as DeFi access. Powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge will convert your original $BTC into wrapped Bitcoin. You can then use this converted $BTC to access decentralized applications, gaming dApps, and Web3, as well as to speed up transactions on Bitcoin, which was earlier not possible due to the network’s innately sluggish and expensive nature. Thanks to its one-of-a-kind mission, Bitcoin Hyper is predicted to surge 12,400% and reach $1.5 by 2030 . Even better, you can join the tribe by paying just $0.012, as the project is currently in presale. It has raised over $1.5M in early funding, even though it’s fresh out of the oven. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Top Altcoin to Buy to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is another Bitcoin-centric altcoin that has the potential to rise alongside the king cryptocurrency, helping you maximize your gains from a Bitcoin bull run. It stands out by being the ONLY crypto to offer free $BTC to its token holders. While other meme coins offer more of their own cryptos as rewards to their community, $BTCBULL will give you a chance to own Bitcoin for a fraction of the cost. These Bitcoin airdrops will take place twice: once when $BTC reaches $150K for the first time, and again when it crosses $200K. And you must store your tokens in Best Wallet to be eligible for the rewards. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at just $0.00258. Why so cheap? Because it’s in presale ($7.1M+ raised). Also, note that the amount of $BTC you receive will depend on your $BTCBULL holdings. BTC Bull Token itself is predicted to skyrocket after its listing on major exchanges. It could surge 1,800% and reach $0.0497 by 2030 . What’s more, the project’s developers plan to boost the token’s demand and price by adopting a deflationary model. Under this, a part of the total $BTCBULL token supply will be wiped out every time $BTC climbs up by $50K. For more info, here’s how to buy BTC Bull Token . 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Education-Based Crypto Trending Right Now Tutorial is a hot new altcoin that has emerged as the market’s favorite thanks to its unique take on crypto education. Where other meme and altcoins look to ride the crypto wave by churning out one amusing idea after another, $TUT has taken a different approach. It’s focused on educating people about cryptocurrency. At its core, it’s an AI-powered tool with a comprehensive library of resources on different crypto-related topics and tools, including setting up a crypto wallet, writing smart contracts, trading on the best decentralized exchanges , etc. $TUT is up over 63% in the past seven days, and it’s currently trading at a low price of $0.05411 . Although it’s at an all-time high, the broader crypto market’s growth in the coming years could easily benefit what’s probably the best education token going around. Bottom Line With an increasing number of public companies (as well as government agencies) looking at Bitcoin as both a store of real value and a hedge against inflation, the time is ripe to put your faith in high-potential altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) .

2025-06-24T14:10:44,"Vinanz’s Strategic Growth: UK Crypto Mining Firm Achieves Significant Bitcoin Accumulation","BitcoinWorld Vinanz’s Strategic Growth: UK Crypto Mining Firm Achieves Significant Bitcoin Accumulation In a bold move signaling robust confidence in the digital asset landscape, Vinanz, a prominent UK-listed crypto mining firm, recently announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury. This development highlights a growing trend among industry players to strengthen their balance sheets with the leading cryptocurrency. What is Vinanz’s Latest Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy? Vinanz , known for its operations within the burgeoning digital asset space, made waves with its recent announcement on X (formerly Twitter). The firm revealed it has added an impressive 37.72 more Bitcoin to its holdings. This significant acquisition brings their total treasury to a formidable 58.68 BTC, showcasing a clear commitment to their ongoing BTC accumulation strategy. For many, this isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver. By consistently adding Bitcoin to their treasury, Vinanz is effectively: Hedging Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation, providing a store of value. Long-Term Value Proposition: The firm likely believes in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential, making it a valuable asset for future growth. Operational Stability: Holding a significant amount of BTC can provide a strong financial backbone, offering flexibility and resilience against market fluctuations. Industry Leadership: By publicly committing to BTC accumulation, Vinanz reinforces its position as a serious player in the crypto ecosystem. Why is BTC Accumulation a Key Trend for Crypto Mining Firms? The decision by Vinanz to boost its Bitcoin holdings isn’t isolated. Many crypto mining companies globally are adopting similar strategies. This approach stems from several compelling factors: Direct Exposure to Asset Appreciation: Miners earn BTC directly from their operations. By holding onto a portion of their mined Bitcoin rather than immediately selling it, they gain direct exposure to any future price increases. Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength: A robust Bitcoin treasury can significantly enhance a company’s balance sheet, making it more attractive to investors and potentially easing access to capital markets. Operational Flexibility: Holding BTC provides liquidity that can be deployed for various purposes, such as funding expansion, covering operational costs during market downturns, or even investing in new technologies. Market Confidence Signal: When a mining firm, which intimately understands the economics and technology behind Bitcoin, chooses to accumulate it, it sends a strong signal of confidence to the broader market. This strategy aligns with a broader industry trend where companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a currency to be sold for operational expenses, but as a core treasury asset. What Does This Mean for the UK Crypto Landscape? The actions of firms like Vinanz have a significant ripple effect, particularly within the UK Crypto scene. As a UK-listed entity, Vinanz’s strategic moves contribute to the growing legitimacy and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the United Kingdom. This is crucial for several reasons: Regulatory Confidence: As more regulated, publicly listed companies engage with crypto assets, it can foster greater confidence among regulators, potentially leading to more favorable and clear regulatory frameworks. Investor Interest: Such announcements can pique the interest of traditional investors who might be hesitant to enter the crypto market directly but are comfortable investing in a publicly traded company with crypto exposure. Innovation Hub: The UK aims to be a global hub for crypto innovation. Companies demonstrating strong, transparent strategies involving digital assets contribute directly to this goal, attracting talent and investment. Economic Contribution: Successful crypto mining and accumulation strategies can contribute to the national economy through job creation, technological advancement, and tax revenues. The UK has been navigating its stance on crypto, balancing innovation with consumer protection. Vinanz’s actions demonstrate that robust, legitimate crypto operations are thriving within this environment, potentially influencing future policy decisions positively. How Does Vinanz’s Strategy Compare to Other Major Players in Crypto Mining? While Vinanz ‘s recent BTC accumulation is notable, it’s part of a larger narrative unfolding across the global crypto mining industry. Many of the largest publicly traded miners, especially those in North America, have also adopted aggressive Bitcoin holding strategies. For instance: Company Primary Strategy Impact Marathon Digital Hold significant portion of mined BTC Large BTC treasury, high market cap volatility Riot Platforms Strategic BTC sales balanced with accumulation Flexibility in operations, strong balance sheet CleanSpark Aggressive BTC holding, rapid expansion Growing BTC reserves, significant operational scale Vinanz Consistent BTC accumulation, UK focus Building a strong UK-based crypto asset base While the scale of operations may differ, the underlying principle of leveraging mined Bitcoin for long-term value creation remains consistent. This collective strategy underscores a bullish outlook from those most intimately involved in the Bitcoin network’s security and issuance. What are the Challenges and Opportunities in this Strategic Bitcoin Play? While the decision by Vinanz to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings presents clear advantages, it also comes with inherent challenges and opportunities that define the landscape of crypto mining and asset management: Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. A sudden downturn could significantly impact the value of the firm’s treasury, affecting its balance sheet and investor sentiment. Operational Costs: Mining operations require substantial capital expenditure and ongoing energy costs. Balancing BTC accumulation with the need to cover these expenses can be a delicate act. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the UK is exploring crypto regulation, future policy changes could impact the legality or taxation of holding large crypto treasuries. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin necessitates robust security measures to protect against hacks or theft. Opportunities: Significant Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, the accumulated BTC could yield substantial returns, far outweighing traditional investment options. Enhanced Investor Confidence: A strong BTC treasury can signal financial stability and a long-term vision, attracting more institutional and retail investors. Flexibility for Future Growth: The accumulated Bitcoin can serve as collateral for loans, be used for strategic acquisitions, or fund further expansion into new mining ventures or other crypto-related services. Pioneering Position: By being an early and aggressive accumulator among UK-listed firms, Vinanz can solidify its pioneering position in the evolving digital economy. Navigating these aspects requires astute financial management and a deep understanding of both the cryptocurrency market and traditional corporate finance. Conclusion: Vinanz’s Bold Step in the UK Crypto Landscape Vinanz ‘s latest announcement of adding 37.72 more Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing its total to 58.68 BTC, is more than just a routine update; it’s a powerful statement of confidence in the long-term value of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic BTC accumulation by a UK Crypto mining firm underscores a broader industry trend where miners are evolving from mere sellers of their output to strategic holders of a key digital asset. As the crypto mining industry continues to mature, firms like Vinanz are demonstrating a sophisticated approach to treasury management, leveraging their unique position to build substantial Bitcoin reserves. This move not only strengthens Vinanz’s financial standing but also contributes to the overall legitimization and growth of the digital asset economy within the United Kingdom. It signals a future where digital assets play an increasingly central role in corporate balance sheets, driven by a vision of sustained growth and value creation.

2025-06-24T14:00:18,"Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Retail Inflows to Binance Spike Before Dramatic Price Drop","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Retail Inflows to Binance Spike Before Dramatic Price Drop The cryptocurrency market is a wild, unpredictable beast, often moving in mysterious ways. But what if we told you that sometimes, the earliest signals come from an unexpected corner – the everyday retail trader? A fascinating development recently unfolded on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, where a surge in Bitcoin retail inflows preceded a significant price correction. This isn’t just a quirky data point; it’s a potential game-changer in how we understand market dynamics. What Triggered This Unusual Bitcoin Retail Inflows Surge? On June 15, something remarkable happened: Bitcoin retail inflows to Binance skyrocketed to over 25%. This wasn’t just a minor blip; it was the highest level seen since May 2023. What followed was even more intriguing. Shortly after this massive influx, BTC experienced a sharp decline, plummeting from approximately $105,000 to $98,200. Just a few days later, on June 19, another notable spike occurred, with inflows reaching 19%, as reported by CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn. Traditionally, retail traders are often seen as reactive, jumping into the market during a bull run (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out) or panic-selling during a downturn (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, this recent data paints a different picture. It suggests that a segment of retail traders was unusually early in reacting to impending market shifts. They weren’t just following the crowd; they were, in some sense, leading it. This proactive trading behavior challenges conventional wisdom about market participation. Consider these key observations from the data: First Spike (June 15): Inflows surged past 25%, marking a two-year high for retail deposits on Binance. This was immediately followed by a significant BTC price drop . Second Spike (June 19): A follow-up surge of 19% occurred, indicating continued unusual activity from retail wallets. The Anomaly: Retail traders typically buy into strength or sell into weakness. Here, they were depositing Bitcoin before a price drop, suggesting a strategic positioning or an early read on the market. This raises a crucial question: were these retail traders privy to information, or were they simply exhibiting a heightened sense of market intuition? The answer could have profound implications for how we analyze market sentiment and predict future movements. Decoding Proactive Retail Trader Behavior on Binance BTC The concept of retail trader behavior being “proactive” is a fascinating deviation from the norm. What could explain this unusual foresight among a group often perceived as the last to react? Several theories emerge when looking at Binance BTC activity: Sophisticated On-Chain Analysis: A growing number of retail traders are now equipped with advanced tools and knowledge to analyze on-chain data, exchange flows, and whale movements. They might have spotted early signs of institutional selling or large whale deposits that often precede price corrections. Network Effects and Information Spread: In the age of social media and crypto communities, information (and sometimes misinformation) spreads rapidly. Perhaps early signals were shared within private groups or communities, allowing a segment of retail traders to act swiftly. Accumulation for Shorting/Hedging: It’s possible some retail traders were depositing BTC onto the exchange not to sell immediately, but to prepare for shorting opportunities or to hedge existing long positions. This would require foresight into a potential downturn. Coincidence or Lucky Guess: While less glamorous, it’s also possible that these spikes were a confluence of individual decisions that, by chance, aligned with the market’s direction. However, the timing and magnitude make this less likely to be purely random. The fact that this occurred on Binance, a behemoth in the crypto space, adds another layer of significance. Binance’s sheer volume and user base mean that even slight shifts in retail trader behavior on its platform can serve as a powerful barometer for broader market sentiment. The exchange’s liquidity and range of trading options also make it a prime location for both immediate transactions and strategic positioning. Retail Bitcoin inflows to Binance preceded a notable price correction. Understanding Broader Crypto Market Trends: A Retail Perspective These recent events highlight the evolving role of retail participants in shaping crypto market trends . While institutional money often drives large, sustained movements, the cumulative effect of millions of retail decisions can create significant short-term volatility and provide early signals. Historically, market analysis often focused on institutional flows, derivatives data, and macroeconomic indicators. However, the Binance retail inflow data suggests that retail activity, when observed keenly, can offer unique insights. This particular incident underscores: The Power of Aggregated Retail Data: Individual retail actions might seem small, but when aggregated, they can reveal powerful trends. Tools that track exchange inflows/outflows are becoming indispensable for market analysts. Decentralization of Information: With more data available to the public, the line between “smart money” and “dumb money” is blurring. Sophisticated analysis is no longer exclusive to large institutions. Early Warning Systems: A sudden surge in deposits to exchanges, especially from retail addresses, could be an early warning sign of impending selling pressure or profit-taking, influencing crypto market trends . However, it’s crucial to approach such data with caution. Not every retail inflow surge will lead to a price drop, and market dynamics are influenced by countless factors. These events serve as a reminder that the crypto market is a complex adaptive system, where various participants interact in unpredictable ways. Navigating the BTC Price Drop: Actionable Insights for Traders The recent BTC price drop after significant retail inflows offers valuable lessons for any trader looking to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. How can you leverage such insights and protect your portfolio? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to exchange inflow/outflow data, especially for major exchanges like Binance. Tools like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and others provide real-time insights that can help you anticipate market shifts. Look for unusual spikes in deposits or withdrawals. Understand the “Why”: Don’t just react to data; try to understand the potential reasons behind it. Are these new buyers, or are existing holders moving assets to exchanges, possibly to sell or use in derivatives trading? Implement Robust Risk Management: Regardless of market signals, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses during sudden downturns like the recent BTC price drop . Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden price movements in a single asset. Avoid Emotional Trading: The crypto market thrives on fear and greed. Data points like these are useful, but they should inform your strategy, not dictate impulsive decisions. Stick to your trading plan. Stay Informed, But Verify: Follow reputable analysts and news sources, but always cross-reference information. The crypto space is rife with speculation and misinformation. The proactive nature of these retail traders, whether by design or fortunate timing, serves as a powerful reminder that vigilance and informed decision-making are paramount. The market is always speaking; the challenge lies in learning to listen. A New Dawn for Retail Influence? The recent surge in Bitcoin retail inflows to Binance, preceding a notable BTC price drop , marks a compelling chapter in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency markets. It challenges the long-held perception of retail traders as merely reactive participants, suggesting a growing sophistication and perhaps even a leading role in signaling future movements. This isn’t just about a couple of data points; it’s about the potential for retail trader behavior to become a more significant indicator for broader crypto market trends . As more individuals gain access to advanced analytical tools and communities, the collective wisdom of the crowd, particularly on platforms like Binance BTC , could become an increasingly vital component of market analysis. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this serves as a powerful reminder: keep your eyes on the data, for the whispers of the market might just come from the most unexpected voices.

2025-06-24T13:57:08,"Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Passed Critical Level in 11th Month! Here Are the Details","Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the United States have surpassed the $4 billion cumulative net inflow threshold in the 11th month of their launch. US Spot Ethereum ETFs Surpass $4 Billion Net Inflow Threshold This milestone was surpassed on Monday, June 23, with daily inflows of $100.7 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. Despite recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the high daily inflows indicate continued investor confidence. Fidelity Takes Lead, BlackRock Second Fidelity’s FETH fund had the biggest inflow on Monday, with $60.5 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, which usually leads, came in second with $25.8 million inflows. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw $9 million inflows, while its ETH mini product saw $5.4 million. Other ETFs saw no movement. Spot Ethereum ETFs, like Bitcoin ETFs, have achieved a positive balance sheet overall despite the large outflows from the high-fee Grayscale ETHE fund. Grayscale ETHE fund alone has seen $4.3 billion in outflows to date. Without these outflows, total net inflows could have reached $8.3 billion. Following these exits, the Grayscale ETHE fund's market share fell from 89.7% to 30.2%, while BlackRock's ETHA fund rose to the lead with a share of 31.8%. Fidelity FETH ranked third with 18%, and Grayscale ETH ranked fourth with 15.5%. “$4 billion net inflow including Grayscale outflows, I think that’s quite a feat. If you recall, some experts suggested that Bitcoin ETFs could raise a maximum of $5 billion in the first year. Expectations are constantly being updated,” ETF Store President Nate Geraci said in an assessment on the social media platform X. Total trading volume of spot Ethereum ETFs reached $89 billion, with daily volume on June 23 at $840 million. While this figure is still below the $1.5 billion daily peak in February, it remains above average. Bitcoin ETFs Still Ahead For comparison, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $34.7 billion in the first 11 months since their launch in January 2024. That figure has now reached $47.3 billion. On June 23, there was a net inflow of $350.8 million into Bitcoin ETFs. This means a total inflow of $2.8 billion in the last 10 days. BlackRock’s IBIT product was again prominent in the inflows. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Passed Critical Level in 11th Month!

2025-06-24T13:53:14,"Leading coin to watch as Ethereum and Bitcoin stall amid geopolitical tensions","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Little Pepe gains traction as macro tensions shift investor focus from Bitcoin to emerging crypto projects. Macro events often play a bigger role than technical charts. When Bitcoin and Ethereum catch a bid, altcoins can struggle for attention. Conversely, when the market shudders at external shocks — such as the recent missile exchanges between Israel and Iran — major coins may hesitate while opportunistic investors pivot toward emerging projects. One such project capturing headlines right now is Little Pepe , whose ongoing presale has already drawn in over $1.7 million in funding. You might also like: This new token could pump 9000% like Ethereum once did Bitcoin and Ethereum take a breather Bitcoin has long been viewed as “digital gold,” with Ethereum heralded as the engine for decentralized finance and smart contracts. Yet neither asset is immune to global uncertainty. Following the missile strikes between Israel and Iran, both BTC and ETH have tumbled for consecutive days on the charts, reflecting investors’ sentiment to reduce their risk-on sentiment. Investors can feel uncertain in this environment as they await clarity before investing. That’s precisely when undervalued coins with unique value propositions can steal the show. When heavyweights pause, investors scan for alternatives that offer excitement and differentiated utility. Over the past week, social media chatter and private group discussions have been buzzing about a meme-based Layer-2 chain that promises to turn the usual token narrative on its head. Rather than merely borrowing the energy of existing blockchains, this newcomer has crafted a self-contained ecosystem that directly addresses the needs of meme coin fans, DeFi enthusiasts, and those chasing the next wave of on-chain innovation. Little Pepe: More than just a meme Enter Little Pepe , a token purpose-built for a dedicated Layer-2 network infused with meme culture. Far from the simple amusement of previous frog-themed coins, this project has laid out a thoughtful roadmap for growth, liquidity, and broad community participation. The presale is currently in its third stage, priced attractively at $0.0012 per token, and has already generated energy equivalent to many established protocols, evidenced by the more than $1.7 million raised so far. Little Pepe is committed to fee-free, frictionless trading on a blockchain optimized for speed and resistance to predatory bots. Users won’t encounter sniping scripts preempting liquidity pools; instead, they’ll enjoy near-instant transactions and minimal network costs. The developers have also allocated resources to secure listings on top centralized exchanges at launch, ensuring ample market depth and easy access for newcomers. Another key reason Little Pepe is attracting savvy investors is its allocation model, which avoids excessive taxation and opaque reserves. Moreover, the team’s roadmap reads like a launchpad for continuous innovation. Early phases focus on building a thriving presale community, followed by strategic exchange listings and marketing campaigns designed to spark wider awareness. In later stages, the plan is to roll out a dedicated meme launchpad, enabling creators to issue their tokens on Little Pepe’s chain. This fusion of entertainment and utility positions the network for sustained interest long after the initial buzz. Riding the next wave of meme innovation Little Pepe embraces the humor of internet culture while providing utility to the crypto space. In markets where the giants have paused, this fresh ecosystem offers both a playground for meme enthusiasts and a utility-rich framework for DeFi pioneers. Investing $400 into Little Pepe today could secure more than 333,000 tokens at the current presale price. Should the project execute its exchange listing plans and ecosystem rollouts smoothly, even a modest bump in visibility could produce exponential returns for participants. That sort of potential return is precisely what investors seek when BTC and ETH charts flatten out amid global turmoil. Conclusion Predicting the market’s reaction to heightened tensions is a fool’s errand. Still, history has proven that the biggest wins often happen when fear is at its peak. By allocating a portfolio for Little Pepe, investors are taking a shot at history, leaving room to ride the next big wave. Little Pepe isn’t just another meme token; it’s built on solid Layer-2 tech and has already received over $1.7 million in presale funding. Those curious about where meme culture and serious blockchain innovation intersect, this is one worth watching. As headlines turn to the latest Israel–Iran tensions, remember that resilience and creativity tend to outpace legacy credentials. Sometimes, the projects born in uncertainty are the ones that redefine an entire market. Little Pepe may just be the token that proves how agility, humor, and thoughtful design can thrive when the market’s biggest names take a breather.

2025-06-24T13:48:54,"Strategy Stock Volatility Sinks to Historic Lows, Possibly Making Shares Less Attractive","Strategy (MSTR) is currently experiencing its lowest 10-day realized volatility since it first added bitcoin {BTC} to its balance sheet in 2020, according to Jeff Park , Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management. Realized volatility refers to the actual historical movement of an asset's price over a specific period, in this case ten days. It is calculated using past price data and indicates how much the price has fluctuated in reality, as opposed to how much it is expected to fluctuate in the future. In addition to subdued historical price swings, MSTR’s implied volatility (IV) currently sits at 48.33 percent , which is among the lowest levels recorded for the stock in recent years. Implied volatility reflects the market’s forecast of a stock’s future volatility, derived from options prices. A lower IV suggests the options market is anticipating smaller price movements going forward. For comparison, MSTR’s IV peaked at 225% in November 2024, during a sharp rally in bitcoin prices following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. At that time, bitcoin traded above $95,000 and MSTR’s share price surged from $350 to a high of $525. As of now, MSTR shares are trading at $367. MSTR currently holds 592,345 BTC , but last week added just 245 BTC, marking its smallest weekly purchase since March. This slowdown in accumulation may suggest a saturation point, particularly as other public companies globally begin to adopt bitcoin treasury strategies. Furthermore, capital flows appear to be rotating from MSTR to smaller bitcoin-holding companies, many of which are experiencing strong performance in both share price and trading volume. Among them are Canada's LQWD Technologies Corp, which has risen about three-fold in recent days on its BTC treasury strategy. Notably, this marks the fourth consecutive week in which MSTR has not utilized its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. As a result, the company now trades at a 1.83x multiple to its net asset value (NAV) in bitcoin terms, known as mNAV. This multiple is calculated by dividing the company's enterprise value by the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Is MSTR yesterday's news? Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy has benefited significantly in recent years from the company’s status as a high-beta, high-volatility proxy for bitcoin. This elevated volatility made MSTR particularly attractive to options traders and speculators, enabling outsized gains on both the upside and downside compared to BTC itself. However, as MSTR’s volatility compresses, that appeal may diminish. With less price movement, traders, investors, and speculators could begin reallocating capital to other, more volatile bitcoin-linked equities or assets that offer greater trading opportunities. In response, Strategy has also leaned into alternative financing strategies, including at-the-market offerings tied to its perpetual preferred stock tickers, STRK and STRF. These fixed-income products represent a strategic pivot, but whether they gain meaningful traction remains to be seen.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/strategy-stock-volatility-sinks-to-historic-lows-possibly-making-shares-less-attractive,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T13:48:53,"Shocking Amount of BTC Absorbed by Buyers During Recent Market Turmoil","Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past $105,000, propelled by the easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East; however, an even more noteworthy story lies beneath the surface: the market has absorbed a colossal wave of profit taking without collapsing. About 720,000 BTC, sold mainly by recent buyers since mid-April, has been met with an equally strong demand, preventing a more resounding crash despite a $66 billion surge in the Realized Cap of coins held for less than one month. Profit-Taking Meets Fresh Demand According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr., the $66 billion increase in Realized Cap for the 0-1 month cohort since April 13 is definitive proof of large-scale profit realization by short-term holders. While such aggressive selling pressure would typically trigger significant downside, Adler highlighted a critical counterforce: new buyers entering the market have been steadily absorbing this massive supply. In his opinion , this offsetting has kept Bitcoin trading within a relatively narrow range in the last few weeks. However, his UTXO Block Profit/Loss Count Ratio Model indicates the profit-taking frenzy may have subsided, dropping from an extreme 34,000 points near BTC’s all-time high in May to just 216 points today. “Profitable sales have almost disappeared,” noted Adler, while the proportion of loss-realizing transactions has increased. The likeliest explanation is that the wave of eager sellers has largely passed, replaced by buyers accumulating at lower levels, reducing the immediate risk of a sharp crash. Meanwhile, the global markets are experiencing a sense of relief thanks to an unexpected ceasefire between Israel and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed a “Complete and Total” cessation of hostilities, quelling fears of a deeper conflict. Following that, investors like Daan Crypto Trades and Michaël van de Poppe echoed cautious optimism on X, pointing out that reduced geopolitical risk could ease headline-driven volatility and help Bitcoin regain upward momentum. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Indeed, BTC has staged a noticeable recovery since dipping below the symbolic $100,000 mark after the U.S. unleashed airstrikes against several Iranian nuclear installations last week. As of this writing, the king cryptocurrency had climbed 3.8% in the last 24 hours to hover around $105,400 after going as high as $105,927 during the Asian trading session. On a weekly scale, it remains slightly underwater, down about 1.1%, which is a modest underperformance compared to the broader crypto market’s 0.4% gain over the same period. The asset also experienced a slight 1.7% dip over the last 30 days, reflecting recent liquidation cascades and historical Q3 headwinds. As analyst Benjamin Cowen previously highlighted , Bitcoin often struggles through the summer months. Past bull cycles saw steep drops of 25–35% between June and July before roaring back in late Q4.

2025-06-24T13:47:18,"Bitcoin Price Holds Strong at $105K: Short Squeeze Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Price Holds Strong at $105K: Short Squeeze Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price held $105k in support on Tuesday, with reduced geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. It happened because Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran reawakened investors ’ morale. Even institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with BTC ETFs recording $350.43 million in net inflows on Monday. In addition, exchange reserves this week fell from $2.491 million to $2.485 million, pointing to declining selling pressure in the short term, per cryptoquant. Moreover, bullish interest seems to be high as the “taker buy to sell ratio” on the Bybit exchange has displayed significant spikes, and several expert bullish posts are flooded on social platforms where targets are aimed as high as $130K to $135K in Q3 2025. Keep reading to know more. Bybit Exchange Reveals Investors Eyeing Opportunities in Bitcoin Dip A recent analysis from Cryptoquant reveals that when market interest wanes in BTC, all data appears stagnant, making things easier to evaluate. In this scenario, a sudden footprint of smart money is easily tracked. The activity starts revealing sudden spikes in the data of Bitcoin’s taker buy-to-sell ratio chart on the Bybit exchange, which were nearly stagnant before. Source: cryptoquant This highlights a significant pattern when overall market attention is drawn to a negative factor, and involvement becomes low due to rising fear. The whale accumulation has been seen to accelerate. In many cases, smart money-loading bags have preceded with the upward trends. The same pattern is repeating now, and spikes in the data amid the recent war uncertainty are evident. It highlights that the odds of a price rise are much higher. Analyst Suggest Short Squeeze Incoming In Bitcoin Price Recently, Daan Crypto highlighted that from May to June, the Bitcoin price was in a severe range between the month’s swing low support at $100K and near ATH around $109K. The recent breach of swing low support during the heightened conflict, followed by a recovery from range lows, has built a big liquidity grab, which has hit many traders’ “stop-loss” orders. Now, experts believe the de-escalation could pump more gains ahead in the short term. Aligning with the bullish sentiment, another expert has revealed that the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on coin glass suggests that the current price is exchanging hands in the middle of two major liquidity leverage clusters. Still, the topside liquidity cluster is piling up strongly per the 24-hour chart. He suggests that a short-term short-squeeze is coming, and the bull run is not over yet. Liquidity is piling up on the topside. Short squeeze incoming! pic.twitter.com/eJthRpHdHt — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) June 24, 2025 Moreover, in the long term, another expert , Ted Pillows, highlights that the recent war-led dip has changed nothing for BTC’s long-term trajectory. Instead, this dip has ensured that room for more upside is clear; he believes that $130K to $135K BTC price in Q3 is possible. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T13:45:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction As Trump Ceasefire Announcement Sparks Bullish Momentum: Is $120K Next?","Bitcoin staged a sharp recovery on Tuesday, gaining 3.86% to reclaim the $105,000 level after falling to a six-week low of $98,000 over the weekend. The rebound was triggered by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, ending what he called “The 12 Day War.” According to Trump, Iran initiated a 12-hour ceasefire , followed by Israel’s compliance, signaling a coordinated effort to avoid further escalation. JUST IN: Israel and Iran agree to a 'complete and total ceasefire starting in 6 hours! BULLISH FOR THE MARKETS #XRP pic.twitter.com/48JIkzaJX3 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 23, 2025 Investors responded swiftly, reversing the selloff sparked by U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. With no reported casualties, thanks to Iran allegedly alerting the U.S. ahead of time, the market perceived this as a sign of de-escalation. Risk appetite returned, with Bitcoin leading a broad crypto recovery alongside Ethereum and XRP. Overall market sentiment improved significantly, helping BTC reclaim key technical support. Bitcoin Technical Structure Points Toward $120K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC has cleared both the 50-period EMA ($103,954) and horizontal resistance at $104,723. Price action is now approaching a descending trendline near $106,500, a level that has consistently rejected bulls since early June. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC manages a clean breakout above this zone, analysts are setting their sights on $109,041 and even $110,522 in the short term. Current BTC Price: $105,209 Market Cap: $2.09 trillion 24-Hour Volume: $67.5 billion Key Support: $98,253 Resistance Ahead: $106,539, $109,041, $110,522 Momentum indicators support this outlook. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, and histogram bars are strengthening. Additionally, BTC has formed a higher low, and no bearish candlestick formations are present near the current resistance level. If $106.5K breaks, the path toward $120,000 becomes technically viable especially if volume continues to increase. Fed Policy, Geopolitics Boost BTC’s Case Beyond the charts, macro and geopolitical events are also helping the bull case. The US Federal Reserve’s dovish comments and rising rate cut expectations have weakened the dollar, making Bitcoin a more attractive inflation hedge. CME FedWatch shows an 80% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 70% last week. And investors are treating Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. The Middle East ceasefire is holding for now, and US macro policy is getting softer, so Bitcoin should see capital flowing into non-correlated assets. Conclusion Bitcoin’s quick bounce after the Trump ceasefire deal and dovish Fed expectations has brought back the bulls. A breakout above $106,500 could take us to $120,000 in the next few weeks. Watch volume and price action at this level, if we get confirmation here the next leg of the macro rally should unlock. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.5M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,566,427 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility, Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

2025-06-24T13:42:26,"Top Next Crypto to Explode 100x as Circle Hit $60B Amidst Investor Frenzy","This may not always feel like a bull market, with geopolitical tensions boiling over in Iran and Ukraine. Bitcoin has traded largely sideways since its ATH over a month ago, and most of the top 10 cryptos by market cap have experienced declines over the same timeframe: $XRP: –4.5% $ETH: –3.5% $BNB: –3.3% $SOL: –16% $TRX: –0.4% $DOGE: –25% $ADA: –21% But while most blue-chip cryptos have slid to the netherworld, the companies behind some of them have taken off. Circle Takes Off, Coinbase Profits Over Past Month Take Circle (Circle Internet Group, $CRCL): the company behind the stablecoin $USDC is having a decent month after its IPO. $CRCL stock has risen a cool 750% in the past thirty days. That gives Circle a market cap of almost $64B, larger than the market cap of its top-10 stablecoin $USDC – market cap, $61B. Circle stock closed the last session at $263.45. Circle isn’t the only crypto company seeing major gains. Coinbase didn’t have an IPO, but it did post a solid 16% gain over the past month, closing at $307.59. Both companies, major players in the crypto economy, are prime examples of how crypto continues to attract TradFi investors despite temporary market decline. GENIUS Bill Fuels Circle Frenzy, Sets Stage for New Crypto Success IPO aside, the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may have set the stage for Circle’s success. The bill cleared the US Senate and is now bound for the House. Should it pass there, the largest economy in the world would have a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill did more than set up stablecoins; it provided a clear indication that sensible and workable regulation is coming, one way or another. That gives much-needed stability, setting up new crypto projects to launch in a favorable environment. Here are three such projects poised to achieve their own double, triple, or even 10x in the months to come. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest Layer in Bitcoin History Ready to Take Off $2T market cap, $105K token price – Bitcoin has everything, right? Not quite. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to give Bitcoin the one thing it lacks – a fully functional, SVM-powered Layer 2. The Bitcoin Relay Program allows users to send and receive $BTC nearly instantly. By monitoring a designated address as a Canonical Bridge, Bitcoin Hyper unlocks the full power of everything from zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to staking and DeFi with the world’s largest crypto. Staking $HYPER doesn’t have to wait until the Layer 2 is fully launched, though; presale investors can stake now, earning 493% APY during the presale. $HYPER currently costs $0.012, but our price prediction shows the token could reach $0.08625 by the end of next year for 619% gains. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $1.5M in a matter of weeks and looks set to ride the bullish momentum to new heights. You can learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find and Trade the Best Solana Meme Coins on Telegram Meme coins are funny things. Sometimes they become big $DOGEs, mentioned glowingly by Elon Musk, and are part of common parlance. More commonly, they spend their entire life cycle out of the limelight, trading underground on platforms like Telegram. Average traders may never even hear about them, and by the time they do, the best trading opportunities are long gone. No more! With Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot, Solana’s best-kept secret meme coins are brought to light, and fantastic trading opportunities uncovered. Snorter Bot offers: Fast, safe swaps Automated sniping tools Limit orders Honeypot detection Rugpull protection Copy trading What is Snorter ? It’s the bot that gives any trader the tools they need to successfully trade low-cap Solana meme coins – and find those 100x opportunities before anyone else. $SNORT currently costs $0.0961 with $1.2M raised in the presale so far. 3. Memereum ($MEME) – DeFi, Memes, Insurance Combined $MEME tokens power an innovative DeFi platform that leverages comprehensive asset protection for your crypto investments. It’s a unique approach, but gives both seasoned investors and crypto newbies a way to protect their investments. Despite the addition of insurance options, Memereum provides all the benefits of an advanced DeFi platform, including a DEX and crypto card. The presale is in its final stages, and has raised $2M so far. Money Flows In, Token Prices Go Up? As Circle and Coinbase see bright days ahead, will corporate earnings lead to token price increases?

2025-06-24T13:41:19,"Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Hit $0.00003 Level!","The post Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Hit $0.00003 Level! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Shiba Inu community has been watching SHIB’s price move up and down recently, mainly due to global tensions like the Iran-Israel conflict. But even with all the uncertainty, SHIB has jumped 9%, sparking a big question among holders: Can SHIB really hit $0.00003? According to crypto analyst Jonathan Carter, this target is not unrealistic, especially considering the growing market interest and increasing token burn rates. What’s Driving Optimism? One major reason for the growing hope is the bullish sentiment in the altcoin market. With Bitcoin recovering and now holding steady above $105K, many altcoins, including SHIB, have gained almost 10%. SHIB’s strong community also plays a big part in keeping the momentum alive. Another strong factor is Shiba Inu’s impressive token burn activity. In the last 24 hours alone, SHIB’s burn rate surged by 582%, removing over 16.7 million tokens from circulation. This shrinking supply could lead to more upward pressure on price. Technical Pattern Hints 3X Gain for Shib Reaching the $0.00003 mark won’t happen overnight. According to analyst Jonathan Carter, Shiba Inu needs to follow a few key steps to hit that target. As of now, SHIB is trading around $0.00001170 , showing a 9% increase in the last 24 hours. On the daily chart, Carter notes that SHIB is forming a descending channel pattern. After falling from the upper resistance line, the price is now testing a key midline support zone. #SHIB Shiba Inu is forming a descending channel pattern on the daily timeframe The price has declined from the upper border and is now retesting the midline support zone A sustained bounce from this zone could drive the price toward targets at $0.00001250, $0.00001500,… pic.twitter.com/Zwtpqlm26V — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) June 23, 2025 If SHIB manages to hold and bounce from this zone, Carter suggests it could climb to $0.00001250 first — and from there, a strong momentum push might carry it past $0.00003. This would be nearly a 3x move from current levels, which is why many see this as a major bullish setup, especially with SHIB continuing to hold key technical zones. Whale Activity Signals Confidence Backing this technical optimism is some massive on-chain activity. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large Shiba Inu holders, wallets owning between 10 trillion and 100 trillion SHIB, went on a major buying spree. These whales purchased an eye-popping 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens in a single day, worth about $114 million. That makes it the biggest daily accumulation SHIB has seen in the last five months, and the second-largest for all of 2025 so far. What’s Next for SHIB? If momentum builds and retail investors follow the whales, SHIB could enter a new bullish phase. A confirmed breakout from the descending channel might be the green light needed for that push toward $0.00003.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-shiba-inu-shib-price-hit-0-00003-level/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T13:38:18,"China’s Nano Labs Targets $1 Billion in BNB With $500M Raise via Convertible Notes","China-based Web3 infrastructure firm Nano Labs has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate Binance Coin (BNB) holdings worth up to $1 billion. Key Takeaways: Nano Labs has signed a $500 million convertible note deal to begin accumulating BNB. The deal’s completion is not guaranteed and depends on standard closing conditions. The company aims to eventually hold 5–10% of BNB’s circulating supply as part of a broader digital asset strategy. In a Tuesday press release , the company announced that it has signed a convertible promissory notes purchase agreement with several unnamed investors. The notes mature in 360 days and carry no interest. Investors will have the option to convert the debt into Nano Labs’ Class A ordinary shares at a fixed price of $20 per share, subject to adjustment. The notes are unsecured and repayment is due unless converted before maturity. Deal Closing Still Uncertain Amid Pending Conditions Nano Labs said the closing of the agreement remains contingent on customary conditions and cautioned that there is no certainty the transaction will be completed in full. The capital raise marks a major step in the company’s effort to deepen its exposure to digital assets. In particular, Nano Labs plans to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BNB’s utility, network security, and long-term value. It intends to use the proceeds to acquire BNB through a mix of convertible notes and private placements. According to the announcement, Nano Labs ultimately aims to hold between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply, a significant target that would position the company among the largest known holders of the token outside of Binance itself. Announcement #NanoLabs has entered into a $500M convertible notes purchase agreement to launch our $BNB Strategic Reserve. $NA https://t.co/bj4nbzDUrq pic.twitter.com/i3ezU3MrcV — Nano Labs (@NanoLabsLtd) June 24, 2025 While no timeline was given for the full BNB accumulation plan, the company indicated that the current financing represents only the first stage of a larger digital asset strategy. Nano Labs operates in China’s growing Web3 sector, providing blockchain infrastructure and product solutions. The move by Nano Labs comes amid rising institutional interest in specific altcoins. Just recently, Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness tech firm, announced plans to raise $500 million to create a Fetch.ai token treasury, suggesting that selective altcoin bets still hold appeal. Blockstream CEO Declares Altcoin Season Over, Urges Shift to Bitcoin Treasuries Despite the rising interest in altcoin treasuries, Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the era of altcoin speculation has ended, advising investors to rotate into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasury stocks instead. In a recent post on X, he stated, “TSRY SZN is the new ALT SZN,” signaling a shift in sentiment as BTC-focused companies gain traction. Back’s comments align with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, over 240 public companies now hold BTC, nearly double from earlier this month, collectively owning close to 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. The momentum behind corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced an $800 million raise to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Days earlier, France-based Blockchain Group revealed plans to raise $340 million for a similar move.

The Dow opened 280 points, or 0.6% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1%. Notably, stocks had closed higher on Monday after President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire to end what he described as a “12-day war.” This pause in hostilities, taken as a sign of easing tensions, propelled risk assets higher, including crypto . Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaimed $105k as a cheery market responded. Elsewhere, oil prices dipped. You might also like: Dow Jones flat amid muted reaction to U.S. strikes on Iran nuclear sites Israel, Iran violate ceasefire Market sentiment has already signaled a bullish outlook in relation to a ceasefire and end to the war. However, jitters remain and the gains are not wild. On the concerns list for most traders is the Middle East situation. Israel-Iran remains top of investors’ factors to consider because Israel accused Tehran of violating the ceasefire, vowing a major response. President Trump nonetheless has strongly urged Israel to “not drop the bombs” and to bring its pilots home. “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!’ Trump wrote on Truth Social. Investors may be cautious amid this unfolding Israel-Iran situation, with prospects of an end to hostilities likely to catalyze gains. Fresh triggers to the conflict, including counter-attacks or U.S. re-entry would spook investors. “The United States is right to put pressure on both sides to comply with the ceasefire,” Michèle Flournoy, former Under Secretary of Defense, told CNBC in an interview . Flournoy however says the conflict is “far from over.” What else are investors watching? Beyond geopolitical tensions, markets are also watching macroeconomic indicators, especially upcoming tariff negotiation deadlines and potential shifts in interest rates. Positive developments on either front could provide fresh momentum for equities. This week, attention turns to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee. With the Fed under pressure , Powell’s remarks will be closely parsed for signals on future policy direction.

2025-06-24T13:31:50,"Bitcoin nears 31% of portfolios as institutions rotate out of Solana: Bybit","Bitcoin’s share of investor holdings has steadily climbed through months of volatility, now nearing 31%. XRP is riding ETF optimism to a portfolio comeback, while Solana’s narrative has cooled, and so has its weight in user wallets. According to Bybit’s latest report on crypto holders’ asset allocation, Bitcoin ( BTC ) now accounts for 30.95% of investor portfolios, up from 25.4% in November 2024 and marking its highest concentration since the exchange began tracking the metric. The surge comes despite turbulent price action earlier this year, underscoring Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bedrock asset. Meanwhile, Ripple ( XRP ) has quietly claimed the third-largest spot among non-stablecoin holdings, overtaking Solana ( SOL ) as market participants position for a potential SEC-approved exchange-traded fund. SOL, once a darling of the altcoin rally, has seen its allocation plummet by 35% since last October. You might also like: Circle stock faces pressure as rate cuts, lock-up expiry loom Behind the shift: what’s driving the allocation toward BTC and XRP? The jump in BTC allocation reflects a deliberate pivot, particularly from institutional desks—toward perceived resilience. Bybit’s report shows institutions now hold Bitcoin at nearly 3x the concentration of retail investors, with BTC making up roughly 40% of their portfolios compared to retail’s 11.64%. This divergence highlights Bitcoin’s dual role: a speculative asset for retail investors and a macro hedge for institutions. The resilience is even more notable when paired with Ethereum’s underperformance. Despite ETH’s May rebound, investors still hold $4 in BTC for every $1 in ETH—a ratio that has remained largely unchanged since late 2024. XRP’s rise appears less driven by momentum trading and more by positioning. XRP holdings doubled from 1.29% to 2.42% since November 2024, as both retail and institutional investors anticipate regulatory clarity. Bybit flags XRP as the third-largest non-stablecoin holding as of May 2025, surpassing Solana, whose allocation collapsed during the same period. With a 90% probability of spot ETF approval priced in on Polymarket, XRP has become a speculative proxy for upcoming institutional access. The capital rotation away from SOL and into XRP reflects this dynamic. Institutions appear to be front-running the SEC, wagering that Ripple’s legal clarity offers a strategic edge over Solana’s less defined regulatory standing. Beyond Bitcoin and XRP, capital is consolidating into a narrow set of majors. Ethereum, while still trailing its November peak of 11.12%, saw its allocation more than double in May from an April low of 3.89%.

The company announced a $500M convertible bond financing round, which would be dedicated to purchasing BNB. Nano Labs , a Chinese infrastructure company, announced a $500M convertible bond, with the goal of raising funds to purchase BNB and build a treasury. The company will sell convertible promissory notes, already subscribed by a group of investors. Just days before the announcement, Nano Labs attracted attention to the growing list of crypto purchases by companies, big and small. The firm spreads across the spectrum as a crypto insider company with a real-world business model linked to chip design and production. Public companies are about to race into crypto. First movers will be seen as visionaries. Late adopters will be seen as dinosaurs.

Following the announcement of another potential BNB treasury, the asset continued its recovery, rising to $637.78. For now, BNB is not seeing a treasury race similar to BTC, though it has become a part of the altcoin treasury trend. Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao mentioned he has heard of other companies considering a BNB treasury, encouraging the usage of the token as a long-term asset. Nano Labs to offer convertible notes with 360 days maturity The intended convertible bonds will mature 360 days after the issuance, with no interest payment on the outstanding principal. The notes will be convertible into Class A shares of Nano Labs at any point before maturity, with a conversion price of $20 per ordinary share, subject to adjustment. The notes will exist as an unsecured general obligation of the company, meaning holders will have no claim on the underlying BNB treasury. The note issuance is not guaranteed, and will depend on demand. Over time, Nano Labs aims to allocate up to $1B for BNB purchases, mostly via convertible notes and private placements. The company has ambitious plans to hold between 5% and 10% of the BNB total circulating supply. Nano Labs has already built a small BTC treasury after a private share placement. Currently, the company owns 360 BTC acquired at an average price of $99,700 . Nano Labs may also increase its holdings as it accepts BTC payments. The company is already experienced with treasury building and has created partnerships with potential investors. The recent drive for altcoin treasuries also targets mostly blue-chip assets like ETH and SOL, only recently branching out into BNB.

2025-06-24T13:30:04,"Unlocking Opportunity: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars into Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Opportunity: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars into Greed Zone The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with a significant shift in investor psychology. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer of market sentiment, has surged to 65, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This notable jump from the ‘Neutral’ territory, marking an 18-point increase in just a day, suggests a palpable change in the collective mood of crypto participants. But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and how should you interpret this surge in crypto market sentiment ? What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by software development platform Alternative, is designed to distill complex market emotions into a simple, understandable score. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ this index acts as a crucial indicator for traders and investors alike. It aims to provide a snapshot of whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or excessively greedy (a possible sign of an impending correction). The philosophy behind the index is rooted in the belief that extreme fear can lead to irrational selling, while extreme greed can foster irrational exuberance and ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out), often preceding market corrections. By understanding this pendulum swing, investors can potentially make more informed decisions, counteracting their own emotional biases. How is This Crucial Index Calculated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key market factors. Each component contributes to the final score, painting a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state. Understanding these components is vital to appreciating the index’s insights, especially when navigating the current greed zone crypto environment. Here’s a breakdown of the six factors that contribute to the index: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful or uncertain market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum, particularly for Bitcoin. High buying volumes in a bullish market can signal strong investor interest and momentum. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes cryptocurrency-related hashtags and keywords on various social media platforms. It looks for the frequency of mentions and sentiment, with high interaction rates often indicating growing public interest and potential ‘FOMO.’ Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this factor traditionally involved weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. It provided a direct insight into how people felt about the market’s direction. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate a flight to safety (investors preferring BTC over altcoins), while a falling dominance often suggests increased interest and risk appetite in altcoins. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies, this component identifies trends in public interest. For example, a surge in searches for ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘buy crypto’ could suggest growing greed. Table: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Components Factor Weight (%) What it Measures Volatility 25% Market price fluctuations and drawdowns Market Momentum/Volume 25% Strength of current trading activity Social Media 15% Public sentiment and engagement on social platforms Surveys 15% Direct investor sentiment (currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to total crypto market Google Trends 10% Public search interest in cryptocurrencies Navigating the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’: Opportunities and Pitfalls The current reading of 65, indicating ‘Greed,’ brings both excitement and caution. When the index enters this zone, it often signifies a period of heightened optimism, strong buying pressure, and a general belief that prices will continue to rise indefinitely. This can be a time of significant gains for those already invested, as positive sentiment fuels upward price movements across various digital asset trends . However, it’s crucial to remember that extreme greed can be a precursor to market corrections. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by pullbacks as the market becomes overextended and profit-taking ensues. The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead new investors to enter the market at peak prices, making them vulnerable to subsequent dips. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors: Stay Disciplined: Avoid letting emotion dictate your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined trading plan and risk management strategies. Consider Profit-Taking: If you’ve accumulated significant gains, the ‘Greed’ zone might be an opportune time to take some profits off the table, securing your returns. Set Stop-Losses: Protect your investments by setting stop-loss orders to automatically sell if prices drop beyond a certain point, mitigating potential losses during a sudden reversal. Research Diligently: Don’t blindly follow the crowd. Conduct thorough research on any digital asset before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin dominance is a factor, consider a diversified portfolio to spread risk, but avoid chasing every rising altcoin out of FOMO. Look for Under-valued Assets: Sometimes, in a greedy market, attention focuses on a few popular assets. Look for fundamentally strong projects that might be temporarily overlooked. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Broader Digital Asset Trends The 10% weighting given to Bitcoin dominance in the index highlights its pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin, as the first and largest cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market. When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it typically means investors are rotating out of altcoins and into BTC, often seen as a safer haven within the crypto space. Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance usually signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where capital flows from BTC into various alternative cryptocurrencies, leading to significant gains in the altcoin market. Understanding this interplay is essential for predicting broader digital asset trends . A high ‘Greed’ index coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance might suggest that the market’s optimism is primarily centered around Bitcoin, potentially leaving altcoins lagging. Conversely, if the index is high and Bitcoin dominance is falling, it could point to a widespread altcoin rally driven by broad market enthusiasm. Beyond the Index: A Holistic View of Crypto Market Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s crucial to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and geopolitical events. Relying solely on the index for investment decisions would be imprudent. For instance, a high ‘Greed’ reading might coincide with positive news like institutional adoption, major technological upgrades (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades), or favorable regulatory clarity. Conversely, even a ‘Fear’ reading could be influenced by external shocks like global economic downturns or regulatory crackdowns. Therefore, investors should use the index as a complementary tool, combining its insights with fundamental analysis of projects, technical analysis of price charts, and a keen awareness of global events that could impact the crypto landscape. This comprehensive approach is key to truly mastering your understanding of crypto market sentiment . Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Emotion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index surging to 65 and entering the ‘Greed’ zone is a clear signal of increased optimism and enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency market. While this can be an exciting time for investors, it also serves as a crucial reminder to exercise caution and avoid succumbing to impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. By understanding how the index is calculated, recognizing the potential pitfalls of extreme greed, and combining this insight with a broader market perspective, you can better navigate the volatile yet opportunity-rich world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay disciplined, and make decisions based on analysis, not just emotion.

ETH is now down by 6.5% in a week and by 10% in a fortnight, with the second-biggest coin in the market also suffering a 29% decline in a month. These are disappointing percentages for such a fundamentally sound cryptocurrency, yet today’s lift has provided ETH with a bullish reversal that could be the start of something big. And with Ethereum looking forward to several important upgrades this year, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look very promising. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is an ETH Pump On the Horizon As Ceasefire Eases Geopolitical Tensions? After declining for several weeks, ETH now looks ready for a sustained period of growth, with its indicators moving into more bullish positions. Its RSI (purple) has bounced from the 30 level, and has plenty of space to continue rising before entering an overbought position. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has levelled off, implying that it too will also beginning rising again. This means that now is very opportune moment in which to buy ETH, and it does seem that whales have begun accumulating the token again , judging by recent transfers. Indeed, if we look at the available institutional data , we see that Ethereum enjoyed $123.8 million in inflows across the seven days to June 23. This puts it comfortably in second place (behind Bitcoin), well ahead of its rival Solana, which witnessed only $2.8 million in inflows during the same period. President Trump's ceasefire announcement was timed within 2 minutes of US futures markets opening, causing NASDAQ index futures to soar 150 points in an hour. Do you get it now? — Maine (@TheMaineWonk) June 24, 2025 It’s turnaround today is largely the result of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and if this can form the basis for a lasting peace in the region, then Ethereum and the wider market can continue rising in the near and medium term. Of course, the situation remains highly delicate, with reports of violations already appearing. However, it arguably remains the case that Ethereum is still in a heavily oversold position, so in the medium- and long-term it should continue to recover. Its fundamentals arguably remain the best of any token other than Bitcoin, with the network introducing the important Pectra upgrade last month , as well as looking forward to several others on the horizon . Based on this, we can expect the Ethereum price to return to $2,500 in the next couple of weeks, before hitting $3,000 again by the end of July.

2025-06-24T13:18:33,"Nano Labs sets sight on 10% of Binance Coin (BNB) supply after $500M deal","Cryptocurrencies displayed significant gains on Tuesday as Donald Trump’s ceasefire claims bolstered market sentiments . Beyond technicals, bullish fundamentals magnified optimism among Binance Coin (BNB) holders. A China-based Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs has revealed plans to invest up to $1 billion in Binance’s native token, adding BNB to its current Bitcoin holdings. The web3 firm aims to hold up to 10% of the altcoin’s circulating supply in the coming times. According to the June 24 press release : Nano Labs will conduct a thorough assessment of the security and value of BNB. In the initial phase, the company plans to acquire $1 billion worth of BNB via convertible notes and private placements. Over the long term, Nano Labs aims to hold 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. Notably, the chipmaker has signed a convertible notes purchase contract worth $500 million to kick-start the initiative. While the deal remains subject to standard closing terms, it marks a crucial turning point for Nano Lab’s broader vision of blockchain integration and treasury diversification. Furthermore, the move reflects Nano Labs’ commitment to establishing itself as a chipmaker and a dedicated cryptocurrency investor. The tech firm has gained traction for its HTC (high-throughput computing) and HPC (high-performance computing) chips and seems ready to test the volatile waters of crypto with long-term accumulation goals. Inside Nano’s $500M convertible notes agreement The official announcement revealed multiple investors have settled to subscribe to convertible promissory notes worth $500 million. These notes will mature within a year (360 days) and won’t attract interest – a lucrative financial instrument for the expanding company. Moreover, investors may partially or convert these notes into Class A shares at $20 per share during the 360-day timeframe. The agreement has room for adjustment. Further, Nano Labs will repay unconverted notes upon maturity. While the agreement remained subject to standard closing terms, the announcement confirms Nano Lab’s calculated and bold bet to strengthen its crypto-centered growth strategy. Meanwhile, the firm will painstakingly evaluate Binance Coin’s value, long-term viability, and security before massive accumulations. The agreement marks an important step in the company’s strategic growth. As part of this initiative, Nano Labs will conduct a thorough assessment of the security and value of BNB. BNB’s price outlook The alt trades at $639 after gaining over 3% in the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarkectap Binance Coin has rallied from Sunday’s low of $603. Technical indicators demonstrate a potential momentum shift to the buyer side. The 4H MACD has bullishly crossed the signal line, with green histograms signaling upside trends.
