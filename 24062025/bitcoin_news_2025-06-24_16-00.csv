2025-06-24T13:57:08,"Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Passed Critical Level in 11th Month! Here Are the Details","Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the United States have surpassed the $4 billion cumulative net inflow threshold in the 11th month of their launch. US Spot Ethereum ETFs Surpass $4 Billion Net Inflow Threshold This milestone was surpassed on Monday, June 23, with daily inflows of $100.7 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. Despite recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the high daily inflows indicate continued investor confidence. Fidelity Takes Lead, BlackRock Second Fidelity’s FETH fund had the biggest inflow on Monday, with $60.5 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, which usually leads, came in second with $25.8 million inflows. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw $9 million inflows, while its ETH mini product saw $5.4 million. Other ETFs saw no movement. Spot Ethereum ETFs, like Bitcoin ETFs, have achieved a positive balance sheet overall despite the large outflows from the high-fee Grayscale ETHE fund. Grayscale ETHE fund alone has seen $4.3 billion in outflows to date. Without these outflows, total net inflows could have reached $8.3 billion. Following these exits, the Grayscale ETHE fund's market share fell from 89.7% to 30.2%, while BlackRock's ETHA fund rose to the lead with a share of 31.8%. Fidelity FETH ranked third with 18%, and Grayscale ETH ranked fourth with 15.5%. “$4 billion net inflow including Grayscale outflows, I think that’s quite a feat. If you recall, some experts suggested that Bitcoin ETFs could raise a maximum of $5 billion in the first year. Expectations are constantly being updated,” ETF Store President Nate Geraci said in an assessment on the social media platform X. Total trading volume of spot Ethereum ETFs reached $89 billion, with daily volume on June 23 at $840 million. While this figure is still below the $1.5 billion daily peak in February, it remains above average. Bitcoin ETFs Still Ahead For comparison, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $34.7 billion in the first 11 months since their launch in January 2024. That figure has now reached $47.3 billion. On June 23, there was a net inflow of $350.8 million into Bitcoin ETFs. This means a total inflow of $2.8 billion in the last 10 days. BlackRock’s IBIT product was again prominent in the inflows. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Passed Critical Level in 11th Month!

2025-06-24T13:53:14,"Leading coin to watch as Ethereum and Bitcoin stall amid geopolitical tensions","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Little Pepe gains traction as macro tensions shift investor focus from Bitcoin to emerging crypto projects. Macro events often play a bigger role than technical charts. When Bitcoin and Ethereum catch a bid, altcoins can struggle for attention. Conversely, when the market shudders at external shocks — such as the recent missile exchanges between Israel and Iran — major coins may hesitate while opportunistic investors pivot toward emerging projects. One such project capturing headlines right now is Little Pepe , whose ongoing presale has already drawn in over $1.7 million in funding. You might also like: This new token could pump 9000% like Ethereum once did Bitcoin and Ethereum take a breather Bitcoin has long been viewed as “digital gold,” with Ethereum heralded as the engine for decentralized finance and smart contracts. Yet neither asset is immune to global uncertainty. Following the missile strikes between Israel and Iran, both BTC and ETH have tumbled for consecutive days on the charts, reflecting investors’ sentiment to reduce their risk-on sentiment. Investors can feel uncertain in this environment as they await clarity before investing. That’s precisely when undervalued coins with unique value propositions can steal the show. When heavyweights pause, investors scan for alternatives that offer excitement and differentiated utility. Over the past week, social media chatter and private group discussions have been buzzing about a meme-based Layer-2 chain that promises to turn the usual token narrative on its head. Rather than merely borrowing the energy of existing blockchains, this newcomer has crafted a self-contained ecosystem that directly addresses the needs of meme coin fans, DeFi enthusiasts, and those chasing the next wave of on-chain innovation. Little Pepe: More than just a meme Enter Little Pepe , a token purpose-built for a dedicated Layer-2 network infused with meme culture. Far from the simple amusement of previous frog-themed coins, this project has laid out a thoughtful roadmap for growth, liquidity, and broad community participation. The presale is currently in its third stage, priced attractively at $0.0012 per token, and has already generated energy equivalent to many established protocols, evidenced by the more than $1.7 million raised so far. Little Pepe is committed to fee-free, frictionless trading on a blockchain optimized for speed and resistance to predatory bots. Users won’t encounter sniping scripts preempting liquidity pools; instead, they’ll enjoy near-instant transactions and minimal network costs. The developers have also allocated resources to secure listings on top centralized exchanges at launch, ensuring ample market depth and easy access for newcomers. Another key reason Little Pepe is attracting savvy investors is its allocation model, which avoids excessive taxation and opaque reserves. Moreover, the team’s roadmap reads like a launchpad for continuous innovation. Early phases focus on building a thriving presale community, followed by strategic exchange listings and marketing campaigns designed to spark wider awareness. In later stages, the plan is to roll out a dedicated meme launchpad, enabling creators to issue their tokens on Little Pepe’s chain. This fusion of entertainment and utility positions the network for sustained interest long after the initial buzz. Riding the next wave of meme innovation Little Pepe embraces the humor of internet culture while providing utility to the crypto space. In markets where the giants have paused, this fresh ecosystem offers both a playground for meme enthusiasts and a utility-rich framework for DeFi pioneers. Investing $400 into Little Pepe today could secure more than 333,000 tokens at the current presale price. Should the project execute its exchange listing plans and ecosystem rollouts smoothly, even a modest bump in visibility could produce exponential returns for participants. That sort of potential return is precisely what investors seek when BTC and ETH charts flatten out amid global turmoil. Conclusion Predicting the market’s reaction to heightened tensions is a fool’s errand. Still, history has proven that the biggest wins often happen when fear is at its peak. By allocating a portfolio for Little Pepe, investors are taking a shot at history, leaving room to ride the next big wave. Little Pepe isn’t just another meme token; it’s built on solid Layer-2 tech and has already received over $1.7 million in presale funding. Those curious about where meme culture and serious blockchain innovation intersect, this is one worth watching. As headlines turn to the latest Israel–Iran tensions, remember that resilience and creativity tend to outpace legacy credentials. Sometimes, the projects born in uncertainty are the ones that redefine an entire market. Little Pepe may just be the token that proves how agility, humor, and thoughtful design can thrive when the market’s biggest names take a breather.

2025-06-24T13:48:54,"Strategy Stock Volatility Sinks to Historic Lows, Possibly Making Shares Less Attractive","Strategy (MSTR) is currently experiencing its lowest 10-day realized volatility since it first added bitcoin {BTC} to its balance sheet in 2020, according to Jeff Park , Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management. Realized volatility refers to the actual historical movement of an asset's price over a specific period, in this case ten days. It is calculated using past price data and indicates how much the price has fluctuated in reality, as opposed to how much it is expected to fluctuate in the future. In addition to subdued historical price swings, MSTR’s implied volatility (IV) currently sits at 48.33 percent , which is among the lowest levels recorded for the stock in recent years. Implied volatility reflects the market’s forecast of a stock’s future volatility, derived from options prices. A lower IV suggests the options market is anticipating smaller price movements going forward. For comparison, MSTR’s IV peaked at 225% in November 2024, during a sharp rally in bitcoin prices following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. At that time, bitcoin traded above $95,000 and MSTR’s share price surged from $350 to a high of $525. As of now, MSTR shares are trading at $367. MSTR currently holds 592,345 BTC , but last week added just 245 BTC, marking its smallest weekly purchase since March. This slowdown in accumulation may suggest a saturation point, particularly as other public companies globally begin to adopt bitcoin treasury strategies. Furthermore, capital flows appear to be rotating from MSTR to smaller bitcoin-holding companies, many of which are experiencing strong performance in both share price and trading volume. Among them are Canada's LQWD Technologies Corp, which has risen about three-fold in recent days on its BTC treasury strategy. Notably, this marks the fourth consecutive week in which MSTR has not utilized its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. As a result, the company now trades at a 1.83x multiple to its net asset value (NAV) in bitcoin terms, known as mNAV. This multiple is calculated by dividing the company's enterprise value by the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Is MSTR yesterday's news? Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy has benefited significantly in recent years from the company’s status as a high-beta, high-volatility proxy for bitcoin. This elevated volatility made MSTR particularly attractive to options traders and speculators, enabling outsized gains on both the upside and downside compared to BTC itself. However, as MSTR’s volatility compresses, that appeal may diminish. With less price movement, traders, investors, and speculators could begin reallocating capital to other, more volatile bitcoin-linked equities or assets that offer greater trading opportunities. In response, Strategy has also leaned into alternative financing strategies, including at-the-market offerings tied to its perpetual preferred stock tickers, STRK and STRF. These fixed-income products represent a strategic pivot, but whether they gain meaningful traction remains to be seen.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/24/strategy-stock-volatility-sinks-to-historic-lows-possibly-making-shares-less-attractive,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T13:48:53,"Shocking Amount of BTC Absorbed by Buyers During Recent Market Turmoil","Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past $105,000, propelled by the easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East; however, an even more noteworthy story lies beneath the surface: the market has absorbed a colossal wave of profit taking without collapsing. About 720,000 BTC, sold mainly by recent buyers since mid-April, has been met with an equally strong demand, preventing a more resounding crash despite a $66 billion surge in the Realized Cap of coins held for less than one month. Profit-Taking Meets Fresh Demand According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr., the $66 billion increase in Realized Cap for the 0-1 month cohort since April 13 is definitive proof of large-scale profit realization by short-term holders. While such aggressive selling pressure would typically trigger significant downside, Adler highlighted a critical counterforce: new buyers entering the market have been steadily absorbing this massive supply. In his opinion , this offsetting has kept Bitcoin trading within a relatively narrow range in the last few weeks. However, his UTXO Block Profit/Loss Count Ratio Model indicates the profit-taking frenzy may have subsided, dropping from an extreme 34,000 points near BTC’s all-time high in May to just 216 points today. “Profitable sales have almost disappeared,” noted Adler, while the proportion of loss-realizing transactions has increased. The likeliest explanation is that the wave of eager sellers has largely passed, replaced by buyers accumulating at lower levels, reducing the immediate risk of a sharp crash. Meanwhile, the global markets are experiencing a sense of relief thanks to an unexpected ceasefire between Israel and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed a “Complete and Total” cessation of hostilities, quelling fears of a deeper conflict. Following that, investors like Daan Crypto Trades and Michaël van de Poppe echoed cautious optimism on X, pointing out that reduced geopolitical risk could ease headline-driven volatility and help Bitcoin regain upward momentum. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Indeed, BTC has staged a noticeable recovery since dipping below the symbolic $100,000 mark after the U.S. unleashed airstrikes against several Iranian nuclear installations last week. As of this writing, the king cryptocurrency had climbed 3.8% in the last 24 hours to hover around $105,400 after going as high as $105,927 during the Asian trading session. On a weekly scale, it remains slightly underwater, down about 1.1%, which is a modest underperformance compared to the broader crypto market’s 0.4% gain over the same period. The asset also experienced a slight 1.7% dip over the last 30 days, reflecting recent liquidation cascades and historical Q3 headwinds. As analyst Benjamin Cowen previously highlighted , Bitcoin often struggles through the summer months. Past bull cycles saw steep drops of 25–35% between June and July before roaring back in late Q4.

2025-06-24T13:47:18,"Bitcoin Price Holds Strong at $105K: Short Squeeze Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Price Holds Strong at $105K: Short Squeeze Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price held $105k in support on Tuesday, with reduced geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. It happened because Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran reawakened investors ’ morale. Even institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with BTC ETFs recording $350.43 million in net inflows on Monday. In addition, exchange reserves this week fell from $2.491 million to $2.485 million, pointing to declining selling pressure in the short term, per cryptoquant. Moreover, bullish interest seems to be high as the “taker buy to sell ratio” on the Bybit exchange has displayed significant spikes, and several expert bullish posts are flooded on social platforms where targets are aimed as high as $130K to $135K in Q3 2025. Keep reading to know more. Bybit Exchange Reveals Investors Eyeing Opportunities in Bitcoin Dip A recent analysis from Cryptoquant reveals that when market interest wanes in BTC, all data appears stagnant, making things easier to evaluate. In this scenario, a sudden footprint of smart money is easily tracked. The activity starts revealing sudden spikes in the data of Bitcoin’s taker buy-to-sell ratio chart on the Bybit exchange, which were nearly stagnant before. Source: cryptoquant This highlights a significant pattern when overall market attention is drawn to a negative factor, and involvement becomes low due to rising fear. The whale accumulation has been seen to accelerate. In many cases, smart money-loading bags have preceded with the upward trends. The same pattern is repeating now, and spikes in the data amid the recent war uncertainty are evident. It highlights that the odds of a price rise are much higher. Analyst Suggest Short Squeeze Incoming In Bitcoin Price Recently, Daan Crypto highlighted that from May to June, the Bitcoin price was in a severe range between the month’s swing low support at $100K and near ATH around $109K. The recent breach of swing low support during the heightened conflict, followed by a recovery from range lows, has built a big liquidity grab, which has hit many traders’ “stop-loss” orders. Now, experts believe the de-escalation could pump more gains ahead in the short term. Aligning with the bullish sentiment, another expert has revealed that the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on coin glass suggests that the current price is exchanging hands in the middle of two major liquidity leverage clusters. Still, the topside liquidity cluster is piling up strongly per the 24-hour chart. He suggests that a short-term short-squeeze is coming, and the bull run is not over yet. Liquidity is piling up on the topside. Short squeeze incoming! pic.twitter.com/eJthRpHdHt — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) June 24, 2025 Moreover, in the long term, another expert , Ted Pillows, highlights that the recent war-led dip has changed nothing for BTC’s long-term trajectory. Instead, this dip has ensured that room for more upside is clear; he believes that $130K to $135K BTC price in Q3 is possible. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-24T13:45:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction As Trump Ceasefire Announcement Sparks Bullish Momentum: Is $120K Next?","Bitcoin staged a sharp recovery on Tuesday, gaining 3.86% to reclaim the $105,000 level after falling to a six-week low of $98,000 over the weekend. The rebound was triggered by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, ending what he called “The 12 Day War.” According to Trump, Iran initiated a 12-hour ceasefire , followed by Israel’s compliance, signaling a coordinated effort to avoid further escalation. JUST IN: Israel and Iran agree to a 'complete and total ceasefire starting in 6 hours! BULLISH FOR THE MARKETS #XRP pic.twitter.com/48JIkzaJX3 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 23, 2025 Investors responded swiftly, reversing the selloff sparked by U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. With no reported casualties, thanks to Iran allegedly alerting the U.S. ahead of time, the market perceived this as a sign of de-escalation. Risk appetite returned, with Bitcoin leading a broad crypto recovery alongside Ethereum and XRP. Overall market sentiment improved significantly, helping BTC reclaim key technical support. Bitcoin Technical Structure Points Toward $120K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC has cleared both the 50-period EMA ($103,954) and horizontal resistance at $104,723. Price action is now approaching a descending trendline near $106,500, a level that has consistently rejected bulls since early June. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC manages a clean breakout above this zone, analysts are setting their sights on $109,041 and even $110,522 in the short term. Current BTC Price: $105,209 Market Cap: $2.09 trillion 24-Hour Volume: $67.5 billion Key Support: $98,253 Resistance Ahead: $106,539, $109,041, $110,522 Momentum indicators support this outlook. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, and histogram bars are strengthening. Additionally, BTC has formed a higher low, and no bearish candlestick formations are present near the current resistance level. If $106.5K breaks, the path toward $120,000 becomes technically viable especially if volume continues to increase. Fed Policy, Geopolitics Boost BTC’s Case Beyond the charts, macro and geopolitical events are also helping the bull case. The US Federal Reserve’s dovish comments and rising rate cut expectations have weakened the dollar, making Bitcoin a more attractive inflation hedge. CME FedWatch shows an 80% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 70% last week. And investors are treating Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. The Middle East ceasefire is holding for now, and US macro policy is getting softer, so Bitcoin should see capital flowing into non-correlated assets. Conclusion Bitcoin’s quick bounce after the Trump ceasefire deal and dovish Fed expectations has brought back the bulls. A breakout above $106,500 could take us to $120,000 in the next few weeks. Watch volume and price action at this level, if we get confirmation here the next leg of the macro rally should unlock. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.5M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,566,427 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility, Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

2025-06-24T13:42:26,"Top Next Crypto to Explode 100x as Circle Hit $60B Amidst Investor Frenzy","This may not always feel like a bull market, with geopolitical tensions boiling over in Iran and Ukraine. Bitcoin has traded largely sideways since its ATH over a month ago, and most of the top 10 cryptos by market cap have experienced declines over the same timeframe: $XRP: –4.5% $ETH: –3.5% $BNB: –3.3% $SOL: –16% $TRX: –0.4% $DOGE: –25% $ADA: –21% But while most blue-chip cryptos have slid to the netherworld, the companies behind some of them have taken off. Circle Takes Off, Coinbase Profits Over Past Month Take Circle (Circle Internet Group, $CRCL): the company behind the stablecoin $USDC is having a decent month after its IPO. $CRCL stock has risen a cool 750% in the past thirty days. That gives Circle a market cap of almost $64B, larger than the market cap of its top-10 stablecoin $USDC – market cap, $61B. Circle stock closed the last session at $263.45. Circle isn’t the only crypto company seeing major gains. Coinbase didn’t have an IPO, but it did post a solid 16% gain over the past month, closing at $307.59. Both companies, major players in the crypto economy, are prime examples of how crypto continues to attract TradFi investors despite temporary market decline. GENIUS Bill Fuels Circle Frenzy, Sets Stage for New Crypto Success IPO aside, the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may have set the stage for Circle’s success. The bill cleared the US Senate and is now bound for the House. Should it pass there, the largest economy in the world would have a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill did more than set up stablecoins; it provided a clear indication that sensible and workable regulation is coming, one way or another. That gives much-needed stability, setting up new crypto projects to launch in a favorable environment. Here are three such projects poised to achieve their own double, triple, or even 10x in the months to come. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest Layer in Bitcoin History Ready to Take Off $2T market cap, $105K token price – Bitcoin has everything, right? Not quite. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to give Bitcoin the one thing it lacks – a fully functional, SVM-powered Layer 2. The Bitcoin Relay Program allows users to send and receive $BTC nearly instantly. By monitoring a designated address as a Canonical Bridge, Bitcoin Hyper unlocks the full power of everything from zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to staking and DeFi with the world’s largest crypto. Staking $HYPER doesn’t have to wait until the Layer 2 is fully launched, though; presale investors can stake now, earning 493% APY during the presale. $HYPER currently costs $0.012, but our price prediction shows the token could reach $0.08625 by the end of next year for 619% gains. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $1.5M in a matter of weeks and looks set to ride the bullish momentum to new heights. You can learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find and Trade the Best Solana Meme Coins on Telegram Meme coins are funny things. Sometimes they become big $DOGEs, mentioned glowingly by Elon Musk, and are part of common parlance. More commonly, they spend their entire life cycle out of the limelight, trading underground on platforms like Telegram. Average traders may never even hear about them, and by the time they do, the best trading opportunities are long gone. No more! With Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot, Solana’s best-kept secret meme coins are brought to light, and fantastic trading opportunities uncovered. Snorter Bot offers: Fast, safe swaps Automated sniping tools Limit orders Honeypot detection Rugpull protection Copy trading What is Snorter ? It’s the bot that gives any trader the tools they need to successfully trade low-cap Solana meme coins – and find those 100x opportunities before anyone else. $SNORT currently costs $0.0961 with $1.2M raised in the presale so far. 3. Memereum ($MEME) – DeFi, Memes, Insurance Combined $MEME tokens power an innovative DeFi platform that leverages comprehensive asset protection for your crypto investments. It’s a unique approach, but gives both seasoned investors and crypto newbies a way to protect their investments. Despite the addition of insurance options, Memereum provides all the benefits of an advanced DeFi platform, including a DEX and crypto card. The presale is in its final stages, and has raised $2M so far. Money Flows In, Token Prices Go Up? As Circle and Coinbase see bright days ahead, will corporate earnings lead to token price increases?

2025-06-24T13:41:19,"Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Hit $0.00003 Level!","The post Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Hit $0.00003 Level! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Shiba Inu community has been watching SHIB’s price move up and down recently, mainly due to global tensions like the Iran-Israel conflict. But even with all the uncertainty, SHIB has jumped 9%, sparking a big question among holders: Can SHIB really hit $0.00003? According to crypto analyst Jonathan Carter, this target is not unrealistic, especially considering the growing market interest and increasing token burn rates. What’s Driving Optimism? One major reason for the growing hope is the bullish sentiment in the altcoin market. With Bitcoin recovering and now holding steady above $105K, many altcoins, including SHIB, have gained almost 10%. SHIB’s strong community also plays a big part in keeping the momentum alive. Another strong factor is Shiba Inu’s impressive token burn activity. In the last 24 hours alone, SHIB’s burn rate surged by 582%, removing over 16.7 million tokens from circulation. This shrinking supply could lead to more upward pressure on price. Technical Pattern Hints 3X Gain for Shib Reaching the $0.00003 mark won’t happen overnight. According to analyst Jonathan Carter, Shiba Inu needs to follow a few key steps to hit that target. As of now, SHIB is trading around $0.00001170 , showing a 9% increase in the last 24 hours. On the daily chart, Carter notes that SHIB is forming a descending channel pattern. After falling from the upper resistance line, the price is now testing a key midline support zone. #SHIB Shiba Inu is forming a descending channel pattern on the daily timeframe The price has declined from the upper border and is now retesting the midline support zone A sustained bounce from this zone could drive the price toward targets at $0.00001250, $0.00001500,… pic.twitter.com/Zwtpqlm26V — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) June 23, 2025 If SHIB manages to hold and bounce from this zone, Carter suggests it could climb to $0.00001250 first — and from there, a strong momentum push might carry it past $0.00003. This would be nearly a 3x move from current levels, which is why many see this as a major bullish setup, especially with SHIB continuing to hold key technical zones. Whale Activity Signals Confidence Backing this technical optimism is some massive on-chain activity. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large Shiba Inu holders, wallets owning between 10 trillion and 100 trillion SHIB, went on a major buying spree. These whales purchased an eye-popping 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens in a single day, worth about $114 million. That makes it the biggest daily accumulation SHIB has seen in the last five months, and the second-largest for all of 2025 so far. What’s Next for SHIB? If momentum builds and retail investors follow the whales, SHIB could enter a new bullish phase. A confirmed breakout from the descending channel might be the green light needed for that push toward $0.00003.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-shiba-inu-shib-price-hit-0-00003-level/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-24T13:38:18,"China’s Nano Labs Targets $1 Billion in BNB With $500M Raise via Convertible Notes","China-based Web3 infrastructure firm Nano Labs has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate Binance Coin (BNB) holdings worth up to $1 billion. Key Takeaways: Nano Labs has signed a $500 million convertible note deal to begin accumulating BNB. The deal’s completion is not guaranteed and depends on standard closing conditions. The company aims to eventually hold 5–10% of BNB’s circulating supply as part of a broader digital asset strategy. In a Tuesday press release , the company announced that it has signed a convertible promissory notes purchase agreement with several unnamed investors. The notes mature in 360 days and carry no interest. Investors will have the option to convert the debt into Nano Labs’ Class A ordinary shares at a fixed price of $20 per share, subject to adjustment. The notes are unsecured and repayment is due unless converted before maturity. Deal Closing Still Uncertain Amid Pending Conditions Nano Labs said the closing of the agreement remains contingent on customary conditions and cautioned that there is no certainty the transaction will be completed in full. The capital raise marks a major step in the company’s effort to deepen its exposure to digital assets. In particular, Nano Labs plans to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BNB’s utility, network security, and long-term value. It intends to use the proceeds to acquire BNB through a mix of convertible notes and private placements. According to the announcement, Nano Labs ultimately aims to hold between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply, a significant target that would position the company among the largest known holders of the token outside of Binance itself. Announcement #NanoLabs has entered into a $500M convertible notes purchase agreement to launch our $BNB Strategic Reserve. $NA https://t.co/bj4nbzDUrq pic.twitter.com/i3ezU3MrcV — Nano Labs (@NanoLabsLtd) June 24, 2025 While no timeline was given for the full BNB accumulation plan, the company indicated that the current financing represents only the first stage of a larger digital asset strategy. Nano Labs operates in China’s growing Web3 sector, providing blockchain infrastructure and product solutions. The move by Nano Labs comes amid rising institutional interest in specific altcoins. Just recently, Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness tech firm, announced plans to raise $500 million to create a Fetch.ai token treasury, suggesting that selective altcoin bets still hold appeal. Blockstream CEO Declares Altcoin Season Over, Urges Shift to Bitcoin Treasuries Despite the rising interest in altcoin treasuries, Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the era of altcoin speculation has ended, advising investors to rotate into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasury stocks instead. In a recent post on X, he stated, “TSRY SZN is the new ALT SZN,” signaling a shift in sentiment as BTC-focused companies gain traction. Back’s comments align with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, over 240 public companies now hold BTC, nearly double from earlier this month, collectively owning close to 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. The momentum behind corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced an $800 million raise to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Days earlier, France-based Blockchain Group revealed plans to raise $340 million for a similar move.

The Dow opened 280 points, or 0.6% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1%. Notably, stocks had closed higher on Monday after President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire to end what he described as a “12-day war.” This pause in hostilities, taken as a sign of easing tensions, propelled risk assets higher, including crypto . Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaimed $105k as a cheery market responded. Elsewhere, oil prices dipped. You might also like: Dow Jones flat amid muted reaction to U.S. strikes on Iran nuclear sites Israel, Iran violate ceasefire Market sentiment has already signaled a bullish outlook in relation to a ceasefire and end to the war. However, jitters remain and the gains are not wild. On the concerns list for most traders is the Middle East situation. Israel-Iran remains top of investors’ factors to consider because Israel accused Tehran of violating the ceasefire, vowing a major response. President Trump nonetheless has strongly urged Israel to “not drop the bombs” and to bring its pilots home. “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!’ Trump wrote on Truth Social. Investors may be cautious amid this unfolding Israel-Iran situation, with prospects of an end to hostilities likely to catalyze gains. Fresh triggers to the conflict, including counter-attacks or U.S. re-entry would spook investors. “The United States is right to put pressure on both sides to comply with the ceasefire,” Michèle Flournoy, former Under Secretary of Defense, told CNBC in an interview . Flournoy however says the conflict is “far from over.” What else are investors watching? Beyond geopolitical tensions, markets are also watching macroeconomic indicators, especially upcoming tariff negotiation deadlines and potential shifts in interest rates. Positive developments on either front could provide fresh momentum for equities. This week, attention turns to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee. With the Fed under pressure , Powell’s remarks will be closely parsed for signals on future policy direction.

2025-06-24T13:31:50,"Bitcoin nears 31% of portfolios as institutions rotate out of Solana: Bybit","Bitcoin’s share of investor holdings has steadily climbed through months of volatility, now nearing 31%. XRP is riding ETF optimism to a portfolio comeback, while Solana’s narrative has cooled, and so has its weight in user wallets. According to Bybit’s latest report on crypto holders’ asset allocation, Bitcoin ( BTC ) now accounts for 30.95% of investor portfolios, up from 25.4% in November 2024 and marking its highest concentration since the exchange began tracking the metric. The surge comes despite turbulent price action earlier this year, underscoring Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bedrock asset. Meanwhile, Ripple ( XRP ) has quietly claimed the third-largest spot among non-stablecoin holdings, overtaking Solana ( SOL ) as market participants position for a potential SEC-approved exchange-traded fund. SOL, once a darling of the altcoin rally, has seen its allocation plummet by 35% since last October. You might also like: Circle stock faces pressure as rate cuts, lock-up expiry loom Behind the shift: what’s driving the allocation toward BTC and XRP? The jump in BTC allocation reflects a deliberate pivot, particularly from institutional desks—toward perceived resilience. Bybit’s report shows institutions now hold Bitcoin at nearly 3x the concentration of retail investors, with BTC making up roughly 40% of their portfolios compared to retail’s 11.64%. This divergence highlights Bitcoin’s dual role: a speculative asset for retail investors and a macro hedge for institutions. The resilience is even more notable when paired with Ethereum’s underperformance. Despite ETH’s May rebound, investors still hold $4 in BTC for every $1 in ETH—a ratio that has remained largely unchanged since late 2024. XRP’s rise appears less driven by momentum trading and more by positioning. XRP holdings doubled from 1.29% to 2.42% since November 2024, as both retail and institutional investors anticipate regulatory clarity. Bybit flags XRP as the third-largest non-stablecoin holding as of May 2025, surpassing Solana, whose allocation collapsed during the same period. With a 90% probability of spot ETF approval priced in on Polymarket, XRP has become a speculative proxy for upcoming institutional access. The capital rotation away from SOL and into XRP reflects this dynamic. Institutions appear to be front-running the SEC, wagering that Ripple’s legal clarity offers a strategic edge over Solana’s less defined regulatory standing. Beyond Bitcoin and XRP, capital is consolidating into a narrow set of majors. Ethereum, while still trailing its November peak of 11.12%, saw its allocation more than double in May from an April low of 3.89%.

The company announced a $500M convertible bond financing round, which would be dedicated to purchasing BNB. Nano Labs , a Chinese infrastructure company, announced a $500M convertible bond, with the goal of raising funds to purchase BNB and build a treasury. The company will sell convertible promissory notes, already subscribed by a group of investors. Just days before the announcement, Nano Labs attracted attention to the growing list of crypto purchases by companies, big and small. The firm spreads across the spectrum as a crypto insider company with a real-world business model linked to chip design and production. Public companies are about to race into crypto.

Following the announcement of another potential BNB treasury, the asset continued its recovery, rising to $637.78. For now, BNB is not seeing a treasury race similar to BTC, though it has become a part of the altcoin treasury trend. Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao mentioned he has heard of other companies considering a BNB treasury, encouraging the usage of the token as a long-term asset. Nano Labs to offer convertible notes with 360 days maturity The intended convertible bonds will mature 360 days after the issuance, with no interest payment on the outstanding principal. The notes will be convertible into Class A shares of Nano Labs at any point before maturity, with a conversion price of $20 per ordinary share, subject to adjustment. The notes will exist as an unsecured general obligation of the company, meaning holders will have no claim on the underlying BNB treasury. The note issuance is not guaranteed, and will depend on demand. Over time, Nano Labs aims to allocate up to $1B for BNB purchases, mostly via convertible notes and private placements. The company has ambitious plans to hold between 5% and 10% of the BNB total circulating supply. Nano Labs has already built a small BTC treasury after a private share placement. Currently, the company owns 360 BTC acquired at an average price of $99,700 . Nano Labs may also increase its holdings as it accepts BTC payments. The company is already experienced with treasury building and has created partnerships with potential investors.

2025-06-24T13:30:04,"Unlocking Opportunity: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars into Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Opportunity: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars into Greed Zone The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with a significant shift in investor psychology. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer of market sentiment, has surged to 65, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This notable jump from the ‘Neutral’ territory, marking an 18-point increase in just a day, suggests a palpable change in the collective mood of crypto participants. But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and how should you interpret this surge in crypto market sentiment ? What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by software development platform Alternative, is designed to distill complex market emotions into a simple, understandable score. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ this index acts as a crucial indicator for traders and investors alike. It aims to provide a snapshot of whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or excessively greedy (a possible sign of an impending correction). The philosophy behind the index is rooted in the belief that extreme fear can lead to irrational selling, while extreme greed can foster irrational exuberance and ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out), often preceding market corrections. By understanding this pendulum swing, investors can potentially make more informed decisions, counteracting their own emotional biases. How is This Crucial Index Calculated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key market factors. Each component contributes to the final score, painting a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state. Understanding these components is vital to appreciating the index’s insights, especially when navigating the current greed zone crypto environment. Here’s a breakdown of the six factors that contribute to the index: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful or uncertain market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum, particularly for Bitcoin. High buying volumes in a bullish market can signal strong investor interest and momentum. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes cryptocurrency-related hashtags and keywords on various social media platforms. It looks for the frequency of mentions and sentiment, with high interaction rates often indicating growing public interest and potential ‘FOMO.’ Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this factor traditionally involved weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. It provided a direct insight into how people felt about the market’s direction. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate a flight to safety (investors preferring BTC over altcoins), while a falling dominance often suggests increased interest and risk appetite in altcoins. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies, this component identifies trends in public interest. For example, a surge in searches for ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘buy crypto’ could suggest growing greed. Table: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Components Factor Weight (%) What it Measures Volatility 25% Market price fluctuations and drawdowns Market Momentum/Volume 25% Strength of current trading activity Social Media 15% Public sentiment and engagement on social platforms Surveys 15% Direct investor sentiment (currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to total crypto market Google Trends 10% Public search interest in cryptocurrencies Navigating the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’: Opportunities and Pitfalls The current reading of 65, indicating ‘Greed,’ brings both excitement and caution. When the index enters this zone, it often signifies a period of heightened optimism, strong buying pressure, and a general belief that prices will continue to rise indefinitely. This can be a time of significant gains for those already invested, as positive sentiment fuels upward price movements across various digital asset trends . However, it’s crucial to remember that extreme greed can be a precursor to market corrections. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by pullbacks as the market becomes overextended and profit-taking ensues. The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead new investors to enter the market at peak prices, making them vulnerable to subsequent dips. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors: Stay Disciplined: Avoid letting emotion dictate your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined trading plan and risk management strategies. Consider Profit-Taking: If you’ve accumulated significant gains, the ‘Greed’ zone might be an opportune time to take some profits off the table, securing your returns. Set Stop-Losses: Protect your investments by setting stop-loss orders to automatically sell if prices drop beyond a certain point, mitigating potential losses during a sudden reversal. Research Diligently: Don’t blindly follow the crowd. Conduct thorough research on any digital asset before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin dominance is a factor, consider a diversified portfolio to spread risk, but avoid chasing every rising altcoin out of FOMO. Look for Under-valued Assets: Sometimes, in a greedy market, attention focuses on a few popular assets. Look for fundamentally strong projects that might be temporarily overlooked. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Broader Digital Asset Trends The 10% weighting given to Bitcoin dominance in the index highlights its pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin, as the first and largest cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market. When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it typically means investors are rotating out of altcoins and into BTC, often seen as a safer haven within the crypto space. Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance usually signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where capital flows from BTC into various alternative cryptocurrencies, leading to significant gains in the altcoin market. Understanding this interplay is essential for predicting broader digital asset trends . A high ‘Greed’ index coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance might suggest that the market’s optimism is primarily centered around Bitcoin, potentially leaving altcoins lagging. Conversely, if the index is high and Bitcoin dominance is falling, it could point to a widespread altcoin rally driven by broad market enthusiasm. Beyond the Index: A Holistic View of Crypto Market Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s crucial to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and geopolitical events. Relying solely on the index for investment decisions would be imprudent. For instance, a high ‘Greed’ reading might coincide with positive news like institutional adoption, major technological upgrades (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades), or favorable regulatory clarity. Conversely, even a ‘Fear’ reading could be influenced by external shocks like global economic downturns or regulatory crackdowns. Therefore, investors should use the index as a complementary tool, combining its insights with fundamental analysis of projects, technical analysis of price charts, and a keen awareness of global events that could impact the crypto landscape. This comprehensive approach is key to truly mastering your understanding of crypto market sentiment . Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Emotion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index surging to 65 and entering the ‘Greed’ zone is a clear signal of increased optimism and enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency market. While this can be an exciting time for investors, it also serves as a crucial reminder to exercise caution and avoid succumbing to impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. By understanding how the index is calculated, recognizing the potential pitfalls of extreme greed, and combining this insight with a broader market perspective, you can better navigate the volatile yet opportunity-rich world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay disciplined, and make decisions based on analysis, not just emotion.

ETH is now down by 6.5% in a week and by 10% in a fortnight, with the second-biggest coin in the market also suffering a 29% decline in a month. These are disappointing percentages for such a fundamentally sound cryptocurrency, yet today’s lift has provided ETH with a bullish reversal that could be the start of something big. And with Ethereum looking forward to several important upgrades this year, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look very promising. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is an ETH Pump On the Horizon As Ceasefire Eases Geopolitical Tensions? After declining for several weeks, ETH now looks ready for a sustained period of growth, with its indicators moving into more bullish positions. Its RSI (purple) has bounced from the 30 level, and has plenty of space to continue rising before entering an overbought position. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has levelled off, implying that it too will also beginning rising again. This means that now is very opportune moment in which to buy ETH, and it does seem that whales have begun accumulating the token again , judging by recent transfers. Indeed, if we look at the available institutional data , we see that Ethereum enjoyed $123.8 million in inflows across the seven days to June 23. This puts it comfortably in second place (behind Bitcoin), well ahead of its rival Solana, which witnessed only $2.8 million in inflows during the same period.

Do you get it now? — Maine (@TheMaineWonk) June 24, 2025 It’s turnaround today is largely the result of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and if this can form the basis for a lasting peace in the region, then Ethereum and the wider market can continue rising in the near and medium term. Of course, the situation remains highly delicate, with reports of violations already appearing. However, it arguably remains the case that Ethereum is still in a heavily oversold position, so in the medium- and long-term it should continue to recover. Its fundamentals arguably remain the best of any token other than Bitcoin, with the network introducing the important Pectra upgrade last month , as well as looking forward to several others on the horizon . Based on this, we can expect the Ethereum price to return to $2,500 in the next couple of weeks, before hitting $3,000 again by the end of July.

What Did He Say About Interest Rate Cuts? – Donald Trump Had Harsh Words for Powell!","The Fed left interest rates unchanged last week, in line with expectations. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a statement that he would act cautiously in reducing interest rates, citing concerns about tariffs. While the developments between the US and Iran following the interest rate decision negatively affected Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, the signing of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel brought the markets back to green. While the Iran-Israel ceasefire remained on the agenda, all eyes were on FED Chairman Jerome Powell's speech. What Time Is FED Chairman Jerome Powell's Speech? At this point, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will present the “Six-Month Monetary Policy Report” to Congress today and tomorrow. The FED Chairman will make a presentation to the House Financial Services Committee today at 17:00 Turkish time and answer questions from Committee members. While all the attention is on Powell's speech, the text of the speech was released in advance. According to the published text, the Fed chairman is preparing to tell Congress that tariffs may cause temporary price increases but that the Fed is focused on preventing them from turning into sustained inflation. While Powell did not signal in his speech that interest rates would be cut in July, he reiterated that it was necessary to be patient and wait for more inflation and labor force data before making any cuts. At this point, Powell reiterated that the FED is focusing on jobs and inflation in an environment of uncertainty, and said that the economy is stable, unemployment is low, and inflation is falling but remains slightly above the 2% target. “Despite increasing uncertainty, the economy remains robust. The unemployment rate remains low and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has fallen significantly but remains slightly above our long-term target of 2%. Increased tariff uncertainty is likely to increase inflation and negatively impact economic activity. The Fed's obligation is to keep inflation expectations intact so that a one-time increase in the price level does not turn into a persistent inflation problem. “I would not touch interest rates until there is more clarity on trade.” Donald Trump Targets Powell Again! While markets await Powell's speech, US President Donald Trump targeted Powell again. Trump harshly criticized Powell's interest rate policies, while arguing that the economy was in good shape and stressed that the interest rate cuts were necessary. Stating that he expects Congress to take action on this issue, Trump argued that the interest rate should be at least 2 to 3 points lower. At this point, Trump stated that the US would save $800 billion per year in this way. Trump repeats stupid remark about Powell: “Powell will explain today, among other things, why they are not cutting rates. There were 10 reductions in Europe, but we have zero. There is no inflation, the economy is fine. We should be at least two to three points lower. “I hope Congress will really take action against this very stupid and stubborn individual. We will pay the price for his incompetence for years to come.” Fed members Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller also said they support a rate cut in July.

2025-06-24T13:15:55,"Monero price approaching $269 support: is this a setup for a major rally?","Monero remains in a strong high-timeframe uptrend despite a recent pullback. Price is now approaching a critical confluence zone at $269 that could trigger the next leg higher, if it holds. Monero ( XMR ) has been undergoing a steady decline but remains within the boundaries of a high-timeframe bullish trend. The current move is being viewed as a corrective phase rather than a full reversal. Price is now closing in on the $269 support zone, a key level that aligns with the VWAP, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a major high-timeframe support region. If this area holds, it may serve as the foundation for a strong continuation toward the $417 resistance and potentially higher. Key technical points Major Support: $269; confluence of VWAP, 0.618 Fibonacci, and historical high timeframe support. Uptrend Still Intact: Current move is a correction, not a trend reversal. Target to Watch: $417; macro resistance if higher low is established. Volume Profile: Currently above average; must remain strong near support to confirm demand. XMRUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The $269 support zone carries significant technical weight. It has served as a volume-supported region in past rallies and is now reinforced by the VWAP and key Fibonacci levels. Historically, price action has reacted positively to this area, and the likelihood of a bounce is high, provided volume confirms it. From a structural standpoint, Monero has not invalidated its uptrend. The correction, while notable, still fits within the context of forming a higher low. For this to be confirmed, traders will need to see consolidation or signs of accumulation on the lower timeframes once $269 is tested. This would indicate a shift in sentiment and a potential setup for a reversal back toward the $417 resistance zone. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $105,000 after Trump announces Israel-Iran ceasefire Volume remains a major factor. The current profile is above average, which is a positive sign in any uptrend. However, if the test of $269 occurs without volume support and price fails to hold, it could break the bullish structure and lead to a deeper corrective move, likely invalidating the current higher low thesis. It’s worth noting that the recent bullish candlesticks have not been enough to confirm a full reversal. Monero is still searching for a clear bottom in this correction. As long as the $269 support holds and demand returns visibly through volume, the bullish outlook remains valid. What to expect in the coming price action Watch how Monero behaves around the $269 support level. A bounce supported by strong volume and accumulation could kick off a fresh rally toward $417. But if volume fades and support breaks, a deeper correction may follow before bulls can regain control.

2025-06-24T13:15:24,"Bitcoinn set for biggest mining difficulty drop since 2021 as hashrate collapses","Bitcoin’s mining network could face a difficulty adjustment on the lower side for the first time in nearly four years. The difficulty could go down 9% within the next five days, which would be the steepest since July 2021, when China’s ban on mining operations caused a 50% collapse in global hashrate. Over the past two weeks, the total computational power securing the Bitcoin blockchain has dropped by nearly 30%, according to data from Mempool.space. Glassnode metrics show that the network’s hashrate now stands just below 700 exahashes per second (EH/s), compared to a recent high of around 1,000 EH/s. Bitcoin miners today almost solely rely on ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) hardware. In earlier times of the network’s history, CPUs and GPUs were enough to mine coins. Profitability now requires custom-built machines consuming significant power, over 7,000 watts, and operating on 220-volt systems with high amperage. The Bitcoin protocol recalibrates its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks to maintain a block production rate of approximately 10 minutes. When fewer machines compete for block rewards, the network responds by lowering the difficulty to compensate. This time, the reaction is expected to be more pronounced. Profitability metrics spell mining stress Data from CryptoQuant contributor IT Tech shows that Bitcoin miners are now “extremely underpaid.” Per the analyst, the market is in a phase of forced selloffs from mining operations to stay afloat. In recent weeks, the sustainability metric has dropped deep into negative territory, with an uptick in selling power, meaning miners are leaning towards letting go of their holdings and away from mining. Miners were fairly compensated during periods when Bitcoin traded in the $90,000–$105,000 range between March and May. Yet, since early June, the profitability is almost entirely eroded. CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin: Miner Selling Power (log-scaled) chart reveals a downturn in the selling strength of miners. The metric, which accounts for how much Bitcoin miners are capable of offloading into the market, has hit a new low. Bitcoin Miner Selling Power Chart. Source: Cryptoquant As of June 24, difficulty and hashrate values, a single miner operating at 390 TH/s and consuming 7,215 watts of power at $0.05/kWh would generate a mere $11.76 per day in profit. It would now take 5,156 days, more than 14 years, to mine a single Bitcoin under these conditions. Mining power slides as geopolitical differences bite On June 22, the United States launched targeted airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.

Iran legalized Bitcoin mining in 2019 and built up a sizable network using subsidized electricity from fossil fuels and nuclear plants. At its peak, Iran accounted for approximately 4.5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. The figure now stands closer to 3.1%. Following the US strikes, there have been several reports of blackouts and digital network disruptions from both Iran and neighboring Israel. The outages could have affected mining facilities, either damaging or forcing them to shut down due to power loss. Some analysts observed a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s hashrate earlier this week, with the network’s computational power dropping by 8% between Sunday and Thursday. The hashrate reportedly fell from 943.6 million terahashes per second (TH/s) to 865.1 million TH/s. The market has so far rebounded against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “total ceasefire” agreement between Iran and Israel. Word from Trump seemingly helped restore investor confidence, pushing Bitcoin back up above the $106,000 level on Monday. At the time of this report, the largest coin by market cap is changing hands around $105,300. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-24T13:10:57,"Bitcoin Investment Fuels Panther Metals’ Astounding 21% Surge with Bold Corporate Crypto Strategy","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment Fuels Panther Metals’ Astounding 21% Surge with Bold Corporate Crypto Strategy Imagine a traditional industry, rooted in the earth, suddenly embracing the cutting-edge world of digital assets. That’s exactly what happened with Panther Metals Plc, a UK-listed mineral exploration company, whose recent strategic move sent ripples of excitement through both the stock market and the cryptocurrency space. Their decision to dive deep into a Bitcoin Investment strategy has proven to be a game-changer, demonstrating how even established sectors are recognizing the transformative potential of digital currencies. The Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy Unveiled The news that catapulted Panther Metals ‘ stock by a staggering 21% was their announcement to acquire a substantial £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This wasn’t just a casual foray into crypto; it was a deliberate and significant allocation of capital, signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. But the strategic depth didn’t stop there. In an even more innovative move, Panther Metals revealed plans to leverage £1.3 million (around $1.75 million) in BTC from its existing treasury as collateral. This collateral will be used to finalize the acquisition of the Pick Lake mining deposit, a crucial asset located in Ontario, Canada. This demonstrates a practical application of Bitcoin beyond mere holding, showcasing its utility as a liquid and valuable asset for corporate financing. It’s a testament to the growing acceptance of digital assets in real-world transactions, even for a mineral exploration company . This dual approach – direct purchase and collateralization – highlights a sophisticated understanding of Bitcoin’s potential. It’s not just about speculating on price; it’s about integrating BTC into the company’s financial operations and asset management strategy. Why Panther Metals is Embracing a Corporate Crypto Strategy Why would a company focused on mineral exploration, a sector traditionally reliant on physical assets and conventional financing, make such a significant pivot towards digital currency? The reasons are multifaceted and reflect a growing trend among forward-thinking businesses: Diversification of Assets: By adding Bitcoin to its treasury, Panther Metals is diversifying its asset base beyond traditional fiat currencies and physical commodities. Bitcoin offers a different risk-reward profile, potentially acting as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Potential for Capital Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant growth potential. While volatile, its long-term trajectory has attracted institutional and corporate interest seeking higher returns than conventional low-yield investments. Innovation and Market Positioning: Embracing a Corporate Crypto Strategy positions Panther Metals as an innovative and modern company. This can attract a new generation of investors who are keen on companies that are adapting to the digital economy and exploring new avenues for growth. Enhanced Treasury Management: For companies holding significant cash reserves, inflation can erode purchasing power. Holding a portion of the treasury in Bitcoin can be seen as a proactive measure to preserve and potentially grow capital in a low-interest rate environment. Access to New Financing Avenues: The use of Bitcoin as collateral for an acquisition opens up new possibilities for financing. As the crypto lending market matures, companies can potentially access more flexible and efficient funding mechanisms. The Immediate Impact and Broader Implications of BTC Accumulation The immediate market reaction to Panther Metals’ announcement was undeniably positive, with the stock surging 21%. This surge indicates investor confidence in the company’s bold move and a belief that the BTC Accumulation strategy could unlock significant value. It suggests that a segment of the market is receptive to, and even rewards, companies willing to innovate and embrace new asset classes. However, like any pioneering strategy, it comes with its own set of considerations. Bitcoin’s inherent volatility means that the value of Panther Metals’ holdings could fluctuate significantly. This introduces a new layer of risk that traditional investors might not be accustomed to. Regulatory uncertainty also remains a factor, as governments worldwide continue to grapple with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies. Panther Metals isn’t entirely alone in this corporate embrace of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating billions of dollars worth of BTC. Tesla also made headlines with its significant Bitcoin purchase, though its stance has fluctuated. These examples, alongside Panther Metals, illustrate a growing trend where public companies are exploring Bitcoin not just as an investment, but as a fundamental part of their financial strategy. This move by a mineral exploration company further broadens the spectrum of industries willing to take the plunge. The Future of BTC Accumulation in Traditional Industries Could Panther Metals’ move signal a broader trend for other traditional companies, particularly within the resource sector, to adopt BTC Accumulation strategies? It’s certainly a possibility. The benefits, such as potential capital appreciation and diversification, are appealing. However, the unique challenges associated with crypto adoption mean that not every company will follow suit immediately. For traditional businesses considering this path, key considerations include: Risk Assessment: Thorough evaluation of Bitcoin’s volatility and its potential impact on the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating evolving regulations regarding digital assets in various jurisdictions. Accounting and Reporting: Developing appropriate accounting practices for cryptocurrency holdings, which can be complex. Internal Expertise: Building or acquiring the necessary expertise in crypto asset management and security. Shareholder Buy-in: Communicating the rationale and benefits of such a strategy to shareholders, addressing potential concerns. The use of Bitcoin as collateral, as Panther Metals plans, could become a more common practice. As the crypto lending market matures and becomes more regulated, it could offer a flexible alternative to traditional debt financing, particularly for companies with significant digital asset holdings. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this space, Panther Metals’ story offers valuable lessons. When a traditional company makes a significant move into crypto, it’s crucial to look beyond the immediate stock price surge and consider the long-term implications: Understand the ‘Why’: Is the company’s crypto strategy purely speculative, or is it integrated into a broader business objective, such as treasury management, diversification, or even operational efficiency? Assess Risk Management: How is the company managing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies? Do they have clear policies for buying, selling, and holding? Evaluate the Company’s Core Business: While crypto can be a growth driver, the fundamental health and prospects of the core business (in this case, mineral exploration) remain paramount. Is the crypto strategy enhancing or distracting from it? Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on how governments are regulating crypto. Favorable or unfavorable regulations can significantly impact companies with large crypto holdings. Diversify Your Own Portfolio: As companies like Panther Metals blend traditional and digital assets, individual investors should also consider how they diversify their own portfolios across different asset classes. The case of Panther Metals serves as a powerful example of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Their bold Bitcoin Investment and innovative use of BTC as collateral highlight a growing willingness among companies to explore new frontiers for value creation and financial flexibility. It’s a clear signal that Bitcoin is no longer just an alternative asset for individuals, but a legitimate strategic tool for corporate entities.

2025-06-24T13:10:32,"Japan Moves to Greenlight Bitcoin ETFs—Crypto Gains Taxed at Flat 20% Rate","Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing a sweeping change to how cryptocurrencies tax is regulated, a move that could reshape the country’s crypto and Web3 ecosystem. In a proposal released on June 24, the agency outlined plans to reclassify cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), moving them away from their current treatment under the Payment Services Act. UPDATE: JAPAN’S FSA PROPOSES PLACING CRYPTO UNDER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACTS, PAVING THE WAY FOR $BTC ETFS — BSCN (@BSCNews) June 24, 2025 The change would formally categorize crypto assets as financial products. If adopted, it would reduce crypto taxation from a progressive rate of up to 55% to a flat 20%, the same rate applied to stocks. The FSA’s proposal is set to be discussed at the Financial Services Council general meeting on June 25. Alongside the tax cut, the shift could also open the door for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan by removing the current legal barriers. Japan Recognizes Crypto as ‘Alternative Investment’ in Economic Revamp According to local outlet CoinPost, this initiative is part of Japan’s wider strategy to position itself as an “investment-based nation.” The government sees Web3 and crypto assets as tools for value creation and regional development, aiming to foster an environment that supports full-scale digital asset adoption. The new policy direction also aligns with Japan’s updated “Grand Design and Action Plan for New Capitalism,” which was approved by the Cabinet earlier this month. The document explicitly supports the growth of Web3 businesses and names them as part of the country’s broader goal of economic revitalization. The government’s stance is that digital assets should be considered part of a diversified investment portfolio. Officials have described cryptocurrencies as “alternative investments,” pointing to their potential as financial instruments with risk-return profiles different from traditional securities. “The healthy development of Web3 businesses such as cryptocurrencies will help resolve social issues and contribute to improving productivity,” the government noted in the action plan. Japan is also looking to tap into the potential of NFTs and Web3 infrastructure to unlock the cultural and economic value hidden in its regions. The FSA report suggests that borderless technologies could help local industries find recognition on a global scale. Analysts believe the policy shift may also be influenced by changing dynamics abroad. The report points to the supportive stance on crypto taken by the Trump administration in the United States and pro-crypto policies in U.S . states like Texas as part of the backdrop. If the proposed changes go through, Japan could mark a historic turning point in its Web3 policy, transitioning from a regulatory-heavy framework to one focused on crypto utilization and market growth. Japan Plans Securities-Style Crypto Rules, Spot Bitcoin ETFs Possible Japan’s recent crypto tax cut to 20% is just one part of a larger transformation underway in the country’s digital asset landscape. In early 2025, Japan’s FSA resumed efforts to formally reclassify crypto assets as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, a move that could pave the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs and stricter trading rules similar to those for traditional securities. Japan's FSA plans crypto tax cuts and Bitcoin spot ETF approval by 2026. #Japan #Crypto https://t.co/kzNYI1CtwH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 10, 2025 This regulatory overhaul follows years of discussions with experts, industry leaders, and lawmakers. In February, the FSA launched a closed-door study group to review how digital assets should be governed , with a reform outline expected by mid-2025 and a potential bill submission by 2026. If passed, this bill would bring crypto under existing securities laws, enforcing rules around insider trading and market conduct, while also allowing regulated ETFs to be launched. The move mirrors the U.S. SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 , which opened the door for institutional inflows through firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. Japan is also taking cues from regional players like Hong Kong and Singapore , both of which are evolving their regulatory frameworks to support digital asset growth. On the taxation front, momentum is building. After the 2023 exemption of corporate taxes on unrealized gains, Japan’s ruling party previously proposed slashing the top crypto income tax rate from 55% to 20% , aiming to attract both individual investors and institutional players. Industry leaders like Sota Watanabe have publicly supported these reforms, stating that Japan is preparing to regulate crypto as a distinct asset class, not just a financial anomaly. Today is a big day of Japan. The ruling party proposed to regulate crypto with a new framework under Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved this year, likely crypto ETFs and tax deduction from up to 55% to 20% come. I am 100% sure more Japanese people come onchain. — Sota Watanabe (@WatanabeSota) March 6, 2025 Taken together, these steps signal Japan’s intent to legitimize and expand its crypto economy, while aligning with global standards.

Blockchains are kicking off the race for DeFi-enabled Bitcoin (BTC ). On Tuesday, June 24, NAVI Protocol, a DeFi platform built on Sui (SUI) , announced a two-month partnership with the OKX exchange aimed at promoting xBTC lending on Sui through user rewards. As part of the agreement, OKX will distribute $200,000 worth of SUI tokens through its OKX Earn program to users who supply xBTC via the initiative. NAVI will contribute an additional $500,000 in NAVX tokens, bringing the total incentives pool to $700,000. “This partnership marks a significant milestone in establishing BTCFi as a cornerstone of the Sui network,” said NAVI co-founder Elliscope Fang. “By collaborating with OKX and the Sui Foundation, we’re empowering users with seamless access to xBTC lending and borrowing, unlocking new possibilities for liquidity and financial innovation.” According to NAVI, the collaboration enables xBTC liquidity providers—both retail and institutional—to earn incentives in SUI and USDC tokens.

2025-06-24T13:00:53,"Bitcoin Breakthrough: The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic 196.9 BTC Purchase Signals Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Breakthrough: The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic 196.9 BTC Purchase Signals Confidence In a move that continues to underscore the growing confidence in digital assets, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, has once again made headlines with a significant Bitcoin purchase . This strategic acquisition of an additional 196.9 BTC at an average cost of $103,290, as reported by Odaily, pushes SWC’s total BTC holdings to an impressive 543.52 BTC. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a powerful statement from a technology-driven company, reflecting a broader trend of businesses integrating cryptocurrencies into their treasury strategies. What does this mean for the future of corporate finance and the digital economy? The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Accumulation: A Deep Dive into Their Bitcoin Purchase The Smarter Web Company , known for its innovative solutions in web development, has clearly articulated its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Their latest Bitcoin purchase of 196.9 BTC is not an isolated event but part of a consistent strategy to accumulate the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This brings their total holdings to over 543 BTC, positioning them as a notable corporate holder in the crypto space. For a web development firm, this move is particularly insightful, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the very essence of digital innovation. This decision by SWC highlights several key aspects: Long-Term Vision: The company views Bitcoin not as a speculative asset for short-term gains, but as a foundational element for future value. Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating inflation rates, Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Digital Asset Confidence: SWC’s move reflects a growing conviction among tech-savvy businesses that digital assets will play an increasingly vital role in the global financial landscape. By steadily increasing its BTC holdings , SWC is signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s resilience and its potential to appreciate over time, making it a compelling component of their corporate treasury. Why Are More Companies Embracing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption for Their Treasury? The trend of companies, large and small, adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is accelerating, and SWC is a prime example of this burgeoning movement towards institutional Bitcoin adoption . What drives this shift? It’s a confluence of macroeconomic factors, technological advancements, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s unique properties. Historically, corporate treasuries primarily held cash, short-term bonds, or other low-risk assets. However, in today’s dynamic economic environment, these traditional approaches are being re-evaluated. Here’s why: Erosion of Purchasing Power: With inflation concerns persisting globally, holding large amounts of cash can lead to a significant loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly seen as a robust inflation hedge. The ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative: Bitcoin is often likened to digital gold due to its scarcity and censorship-resistant properties. Just as gold has historically served as a safe-haven asset, Bitcoin is emerging as a preferred alternative in the digital age. Diversification Benefits: Adding Bitcoin to a portfolio can offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns, given its relatively low correlation with traditional asset classes. Innovation and Future-Proofing: For technology companies like The Smarter Web Company, investing in Bitcoin is also a statement of alignment with future technological and financial paradigms. It’s about being at the forefront of innovation. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have famously pioneered this corporate treasury strategy, paving the way for others. Their successes, despite market volatility, have provided a blueprint and confidence for more enterprises to explore institutional Bitcoin adoption . Navigating the World of Cryptocurrency Investment: Key Considerations for Businesses While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, engaging in cryptocurrency investment requires careful consideration and a robust strategy. For businesses, the decision to acquire and hold Bitcoin involves navigating both significant opportunities and potential challenges. SWC’s methodical approach provides a valuable case study. Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Potential for Significant Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests substantial upside potential over the long term, offering a way to grow corporate assets beyond traditional means. Enhanced Brand Image: For some companies, adopting Bitcoin can enhance their reputation as innovative, forward-thinking entities, attracting new talent and customers. Access to a New Financial Ecosystem: Holding Bitcoin opens doors to decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications, potentially creating new revenue streams or operational efficiencies. Challenges and Risks to Address: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can impact the reported value of corporate BTC holdings . Businesses must be prepared for this volatility and adopt a long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions, posing compliance challenges. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security protocols to protect against hacks and theft. This often involves cold storage solutions and multi-signature wallets. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex, requiring expert financial guidance. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Cryptocurrency Investment: For any company contemplating a similar move to The Smarter Web Company , here are crucial steps: Thorough Due Diligence: Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and risks comprehensively. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define the purpose of the investment (e.g., inflation hedge, growth asset), the amount to allocate, and the holding period. Implement Robust Security: Partner with reputable custodians or implement advanced self-custody solutions. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal, financial, and tax professionals experienced in digital assets. Communicate Transparently: Be clear with stakeholders about the rationale and risks involved. What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries? The move by The Smarter Web Company is a testament to the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. As more companies witness the success stories and navigate the challenges, we can expect this trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption to continue gaining momentum. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has also made it easier for traditional institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without direct custody. This infrastructure development further de-risks the asset for corporate investors, potentially leading to an even wider embrace. Looking ahead, corporate BTC holdings could become a standard component of treasury management, especially for companies with a long-term investment horizon and a high tolerance for short-term volatility. The narrative is shifting from ‘if’ companies will invest in Bitcoin to ‘when’ and ‘how much’. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future The Smarter Web Company ‘s latest Bitcoin purchase is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s role in the evolving global financial landscape. By increasing their BTC holdings to over 543 BTC, SWC joins a growing list of forward-thinking enterprises that recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset. This bold move underscores the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption and serves as a compelling example of how businesses are increasingly engaging in significant cryptocurrency investment to diversify their treasuries, hedge against inflation, and position themselves for the digital future. As the world continues its journey towards digitalization, companies like SWC are leading the charge, demonstrating a profound confidence in the decentralized revolution.

The rally aligned with a broader crypto bounce as Bitcoin reclaimed the $105,000 level while altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin all posted solid gains. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by around 5% over the last day to stand at $3.25 trillion. SEI price surged by more than 40% in the last 24 hours to hit $0.268, recording its highest level since May 12. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by a massive 258% to stand at $793 million. The token has now more than doubled from its April lows, boasting a market cap of $1.53 billion. DeFi booms on SEI The crypto market rebound followed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a potential ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This move eased geopolitical tensions and sparked risk-on sentiment across global markets. But SEI’s climb wasn’t just about macro tailwinds, as its on-chain fundamentals are flashing green. As per the data provided by DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on the SEI blockchain soared 26% over the last day to hit $535 million. It is just shy of its all-time high of $535 million. Its TVL stood around $208 million at the beginning of the year, and has now doubled. SEI’s DeFi TVL is now up by 10% over the past month. SEI TVL. Source: DefiLlama The surge is being powered by the rising adoption of Sei-based decentralized applications. Data shows that Yei Finance, a lending protocol modeled after Aave, now dominates the chain with $314 million in assets. Takara Lend, another lending dApp, has attracted $59 million in TVL. SEI futures open interest soars 84% Stablecoin growth has been explosive on the SEI chain. The total stablecoin supply on the chain has jumped from just $1.2 million in March to over $225 million today. USDC is commanding more than 83% of the market share. Protocol revenues are also following suit, as its monthly earnings from SEI-based DeFi protocols have ballooned from $116,000 in March to $562,000 in June. This reflects high user activity and transaction throughput. Derivatives markets show that open interest in SEI futures has soared by over 84% in the last 24 hours. Institutional interest may soon get another catalyst as Sei Network was recently shortlisted as a candidate blockchain for Wyoming’s WYST stablecoin pilot. This all comes in as the Fear and Greed index returns to the “Neutral” territory after spending a day in “Fear.” Bitcoin price dipped below the $100K level just to make a comeback rally, hitting $106k.

2025-06-24T13:00:24,"Ripple IPO Could Break Records—Deaton Predicts $100 Billion Valuation","Pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton reignited speculation over a Ripple initial public offering late on Monday, arguing on X that the timing is now a big factor. Deaton noted that stablecoin issuer Circle’s public float has shown what deep, liquid US equity markets will tolerate, and suggested that if Circle can command a 62-75 billion market cap, then Ripple could even surpass a $100 billion valuation. “I know Brad Garlinghouse said Ripple is NOT in a rush to go public. They certainly don’t need to raise capital, which is often a primary reason to go public. But TIMING an IPO is also a big consideration. If Circle can hit a $62B-75B market cap then Ripple, with nearly 40B XRP, currently valued at $2 (ie $80B), could certainly hit a $100B market cap in this environment,” Deaton wrote via X. Ripple’s Fast-Rising Private Valuation His comments dropped just days after Ripple opened a $700 million tender offer that prices private shares at $175—a 135 percent premium to recent secondary trading on Hyve and nearly triple the $65 tender executed two summers ago. The latest price implies an equity valuation of roughly $25 billion for the 141 million shares outstanding. January’s buy-back had cleared at $125, underscoring how quickly insiders are marking the company higher. Internal deal documents circulated with the offer show $3.7 billion in cash, zero debt, and 41 billion XRP on the balance sheet—assets worth about $94 billion at spot or $47 billion using a fifty-percent haircut. For now, though, management insists liquidity events are simply housekeeping. “IPO is not a priority ,” CEO Brad Garlinghouse told shareholders in the tender-offer email that accompanied the latest buy-back. However, regulatory overhang could be the main gating factor. In March the US Securities and Exchange Commission withdrew its appeal of Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling that programmatic XRP sales are not securities, a move Garlinghouse hailed as a “long-overdue surrender.” The agency and Ripple then negotiated a framework to dissolve the remaining injunction and split a previously imposed $125 million penalty, with $75 million returning to Ripple’s treasury and $50 million going to the SEC; that joint motion was filed on June 13 and awaits Torres’s sign-off. An earlier $50 million proposal was bounced in May for procedural defects, but the latest submission is widely expected to close the book on the five-year litigation. Deaton’s $100 billion figure rests on treating Ripple’s XRP escrow as a de-facto asset base and assuming public investors will capitalize it at—or even above—spot value. That approach departs from how Wall Street valued Circle, whose June 4 New York Stock Exchange debut raised $1.1 billion at a $6.9 billion equity valuation even though roughly $62 billion in USDC circulates on-chain. Skeptics point out that Circle’s tokens are liabilities, not residual assets, and that public-market investors have historically resisted paying dollar-for-dollar for native coins held by an issuer. Nevertheless, even excluding the escrow entirely, Ripple’s cash, securities and operating income already underpin a double-digit billion valuation that could expand sharply if XRP remains above $2.15. Could Ripple Top Coinbase’s Record? If Ripple were to float at a fully-diluted $100 billion, it would eclipse Coinbase’s $86 billion landmark direct listing in April 2021 and set a new high-water mark for a crypto-native equity listing. Deaton’s thesis thus frames a potential record-breaker at the intersection of two forces: a legal détente that removes the core regulatory discount and a still-expanding XRP treasury whose mark-to-market value increasingly dwarfs Ripple’s current private-share price. Judge Torres’s decision on the June 13 motion is the next catalyst. If she signs off, Ripple will emerge from the SEC saga with both a leaner penalty and a courtroom vindication it can take on the roadshow circuit.

2025-06-24T13:00:00,"When Will XRP Price Hit ATH? Timeline Revealed","The post When Will XRP Price Hit ATH? Timeline Revealed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (excluding stablecoins), is once again grabbing headlines. After an explosive 359.9% rally over the past year—surpassing both Bitcoin and Ethereum—XRP has entered a consolidation phase in 2025. While Q1 saw a mere 0.45% uptick, the current quarter has delivered only a 4.11% gain so far. Despite the muted start to the year, technical analysts are eyeing a potential breakout that could redefine XRP’s trajectory for the rest of 2025. Ripple (XRP) Price: Bullish Breakout Ahead? Recent technical analysis highlights the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern on XRP’s daily chart. This classic chart formation typically indicates a period of consolidation, where both buyers and sellers are in a standoff, creating lower highs and higher lows over time. Upper Trendline – Connects declining highs Lower Trendline – Connects rising lows This pattern is considered neutral, meaning XRP could break out in either direction—upward or downward. When Will XRP Price Break Out? Mark These Dates According to crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO , the current symmetrical triangle spans 334 days, and breakouts typically occur between 75% and 95% of the pattern’s duration. Key breakout window : 75% completion – Day 251 95% completion – Day 317 Most likely breakout period: Early July to Mid-September 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025: $5 or $2? The direction of the breakout could set the stage for XRP’s future: Bullish Scenario Breaks above upper trendline Target: $5 or more Bearish Scenario Falls below lower trendline Support: Around $2 or lower Current Price : $2.18 (up 8.2% in 24 hours ) 7-Day Change : -2.6% 14-Day Change : -4.7% .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Iran Breaks Ceasefire With Israel, $500M Wiped From Crypto Market , Why This Matters for XRP Investors Consolidation may be ending —volatility likely ahead Symmetrical triangle suggests a big move is coming July–September 2025 is a critical window to watch Final Thoughts With the breakout window fast approaching, XRP holders and traders should stay alert. A move above or below the triangle could signal the beginning of a new trend—possibly propelling XRP to new highs near $5 , or triggering a retracement near key support levels. Stay tuned—this could be one of the most pivotal moments for XRP in 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP reaching $1,000 is considered highly unrealistic, as it would require a market capitalization far beyond the entire crypto market’s current size. Does XRP still have a future? Yes, XRP still has a future, supported by ongoing institutional interest, developments in the XRP Ledger, and its continued use in cross-border payments. Who is Arthur Britto? Arthur Britto is a co-founder of Ripple Labs and a key architect of the XRP Ledger. Known for his extreme privacy, he recently broke a 14-year silence with a public post on X (formerly Twitter). How much will XRP reach in 2025? According to Coinpedia, XRP is expected to trade between $1.81 and $5.62 in 2025, with an average price around $2.96. Can XRP hit $10?

2025-06-24T12:53:09,"The crypto bull run is here: top 3 altcoins to buy today","A crypto bull run could be on the horizon following the de-escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel and growing speculation around interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In a statement on Friday, June 20, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said tariffs were having a minimal impact on inflation and that he would support a rate cut in July. On Monday, Fed official Michele Bowman echoed a similar view, further fueling market optimism. Further, Bitcoin ( BTC ) demand continues rising as spot ETFs added over $350 million in assets on Monday. Bitcoin supply on exchanges has fallen to an eight-year low. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish signal that could trigger a broader crypto rally. You might also like: Surprise Fed statement sparks hopes of Bitcoin and altcoin rally Top altcoins to buy if a crypto bull run happens The best altcoins to consider during a bull run are those with strong fundamentals and promising technical setups. Among the top candidates are Binance Coin ( BNB ), Morpho ( MORPHO ), and Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ). Aerodrome Finance Aerodrome Finance is a leading altcoin to watch due to its dominance on the Base network. It is now the largest decentralized exchange on Base and the fourth-largest in the entire DeFi ecosystem. Over the past 24 hours, Aerodrome handled $614 million in trading volume, with a 30-day total of $14.2 billion. AERO’s volume is expected to surge further once it is integrated into Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange. This likely explains growing interest from smart money investors. According to Nansen data , AERO tokens worth $155,000 were purchased in the last 24 hours by these investors. Morpho Morpho is another strong candidate thanks to its rapidly expanding footprint on the Base network. Its total value locked has surged more than 16% in the past 30 days, climbing to over $4.19 billion. Morpho’s momentum accelerated after it was integrated into Coinbase’s platform, enabling users to borrow against their Bitcoin holdings. Like AERO, smart money investors are accumulating MORPHO ahead of a potential bull run, with over $300,000 in token purchases recorded in the last 24 hours. Binance Coin BNB remains a top altcoin pick thanks to its robust fundamentals. The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) has become the largest player in the DEX ecosystem, processing over $159 billion in transactions over the past 30 days—more than Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Base, combined. BSC is also a major force in the stablecoin sector, with over $335 billion in volume over the same period. Stablecoin wallet addresses on BSC have jumped by 187% in the last 30 days, reaching 11.5 million. BNB is also highly deflationary, with more than $1 billion in tokens burned each quarter. The long-term goal is to reduce the circulating supply from over 140 million tokens today to 100 million.

2025-06-24T12:50:32,"Bitcoin Millionaire Shares His Top 5 Altcoin Picks to Grow a $25M Crypto Portfolio – Meme Coins Dominate","A notable Bitcoin investor has revealed his top five alternative cryptocurrencies chosen to boost a $25 million digital asset portfolio. Surprisingly, meme coins make up a significant part of his picks, highlighting a possible shift in market dynamics. This disclosure sheds light on emerging opportunities and trends within the cryptocurrency space. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Crypto Phenomenon – What's Next? Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer created it to bring some fun to the serious world of cryptocurrencies. They used the popular Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There's no cap on how many can exist, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin's value skyrocketed in 2021. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, surpassing $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk. It showcased the power of community and how online trends can impact financial markets. Dogecoin's potential lies in its active community and widespread recognition. Its technology allows for fast and low-cost transactions. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as an attractive opportunity, especially for those looking for quick gains. However, its unlimited supply could affect its value over time. Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have advanced features and clear use cases, Dogecoin is more speculative. Market trends show that meme coins can rise and fall quickly. While Dogecoin has made waves, investors should consider the volatility of the crypto market. It's important to stay informed and approach such investments with caution. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That's More Than Just a Cute Dog Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun experiment inspired by Dogecoin. But it's not just a copycat. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with a wide range of apps and services on Ethereum. Created in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB began with a huge number of tokens—one quadrillion! Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large amount to help with COVID-19 relief in India and burned (destroyed) 40% of the total supply. This brought a lot of attention to SHIB. What makes SHIB interesting is its potential beyond being a meme coin. Because it's on Ethereum, developers have built ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade tokens without a middleman. They're also planning a platform for NFTs (digital collectibles) and a system where holders can help make decisions for the community. These developments could give SHIB more uses and value. In today's market, where people are looking for cryptocurrencies with real-world applications, SHIB's growth and active community might make it an attractive option compared to other meme coins. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Revitalizing the Solana Ecosystem BONK is the latest memecoin making waves in the crypto world. Built on the Solana blockchain, it features a cheerful Shiba Inu mascot and a mission to empower the community. Unlike many tokens dominated by venture capitalists, BONK aims to redistribute power by airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana's NFT and DeFi participants. This strategy has spurred significant interest, leading to a surge of over 100% following its listing on Coinbase. Despite the challenges of a large total supply and the wild swings common to memecoins, BONK shows promise. It’s integrating deeply into the growing Solana ecosystem, with initiatives like launching BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. This involvement in decentralized applications positions BONK as more than just a fleeting trend. In the current market cycle, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option for those interested in the blending of memes and meaningful blockchain development. From Meme to Millions: The Rise of PEPE Coin in the Crypto World PEPE Coin is making waves in the crypto community. Born on the Ethereum platform, it's a deflationary memecoin inspired by Pepe the Frog, a popular internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. In a stunning surge between April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, and a strong community of enthusiasts grew around the coin. This phenomenon sparked what's being called a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme-based cryptocurrencies popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. It stands out by having no taxes and embracing its role as a pure memecoin without pretense of utility. With a roadmap that includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a ""meme takeover,"" PEPE is positioning itself for growth. The upcoming Bitcoin halving has traders hopeful for a market upswing, and some believe PEPE could ride that wave to new highs. Whether it's an attractive investment now depends on one's appetite for risk in the volatile world of memecoins. As trends evolve, PEPE could either fade away or become the next big thing in crypto. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE are strong picks, XYZVerse (XYZ) leads with its sports-meme fusion, aiming for 20,000% growth and community-driven success in the current bull run.

Right on cue, Bitcoin advocate and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor shared a cryptic tweet that’s sparking curiosity across the crypto space. Saylor’s “Land’s End” Post: A Call to Think Long-Term? Saylor posted an AI-generated image of himself at Land’s End, a well-known coastal spot in the U.K., wearing his signature orange tie (a nod to Bitcoin) and standing by a black car. The caption simply read, “Meet me at Land’s End.” While brief, the message feels symbolic. Land’s End is known for its sweeping views and rugged cliffs, the kind of place you go to take it all in. That could be Saylor’s subtle way of encouraging Bitcoin holders to zoom out and think long term. Watch the markets like a tourist, don’t panic like a participant. The post came just after Bitcoin’s rally – a move likely linked to easing tensions in the Middle East. It fits Saylor’s consistent message: hold onto Bitcoin, no matter what. In his eyes, it’s digital gold built to weather storms. Meet me at Land’s End. pic.twitter.com/hZVlp4T28C — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 24, 2025 Strategy Adds $26M in Bitcoin Adding weight to Saylor’s message, Strategy revealed it had bought another 245 BTC this Monday, spending around $26 million. That brings the company’s total holdings to a massive 592,345 BTC, worth about $62.28 billion at current prices. This follows last week’s huge buy of 10,100 BTC for $1 billion. With each purchase, Strategy is cementing its position as one of the biggest institutional holders of Bitcoin. It also reflects Saylor’s strong belief that Bitcoin will continue to outperform in the long run- regardless of short-term market noise or global events. Bitcoin’s Bounce: A Sign of What’s to Come? The recent price surge shows just how quickly Bitcoin can react to global developments. As military tensions cool in the Middle East, investor confidence appears to be returning. Bitcoin’s quick bounce back has sparked talk of a potential new rally. With Saylor doubling down and Strategy continuing to stack, the message is clear: the bulls are not backing off. The crypto crowd is now watching closely to see if Bitcoin can build on this momentum in the days ahead.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/what-does-michael-saylors-viral-lands-end-tweet-mean-bitcoin-holders-take-note/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-24T12:45:18,"Turkey cranks up monitoring on illegal crypto betting and fraud","Turkey is tightening controls on cryptocurrency to stop criminals from laundering money from illegal betting and fraud. Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek shared an article on X by state-owned Anadolu news agency, saying Turkey plans to set limits on transfers and introduce waiting periods for crypto withdrawals. Translated post of Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek. Source: Mehmet Şimşek (X/Twitter) According to the report , withdrawals will face a 48 to 72-hour delay if the so-called travel rule is not applied. “We are taking new steps to prevent the laundering of criminal proceeds obtained from illegal betting and fraud through cryptocurrency transactions,” Şimşek said. He added, “In addition to administrative sanctions, various legal and financial penalties, including denial or cancellation of license, may be imposed on platforms that do not comply with the new regulations.” Anadolu said stablecoin transfer will be capped at $3,000 a day and $50,000 a month to curb fast outflows of illicit funds, although platforms meeting full travel-rule checks can offer twice those limits. The travel rule requires providers to verify and share details about both the sender and the recipient of a virtual asset transfer. The finance ministry also aims to force crypto platforms to record where funds come from and why they move, Anadolu news agency said. Crypto platforms in Turkey to impose withdrawal delays Under the plan, users must give a transaction note of at least 20 characters for every transfer. Platforms also have to enforce a 48-hour hold for most withdrawals and a 72-hour wait on a user’s first withdrawal when the travel rule does not apply. These measures form part of a wider crackdown by the Treasury and Finance Ministry to boost its oversight of crypto asset service providers. Şimşek told the Anadolu news agency that the goal is to curb criminal misuse without stopping lawful crypto activity. “Left-wing space for legitimate crypto asset activities will be maintained,” he said. The ministry says the changes will take effect soon.

2025-06-24T12:40:45,"Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 20: A Critical Shift to Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 20: A Critical Shift to Bitcoin Season The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with shifts and trends, and one of the most keenly watched indicators for market sentiment is the Altcoin Season Index . Recently, this crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a significant drop to 20 at 00:39 UTC on June 24. This notable decline, up six points from the previous day’s figure, isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal that the broader crypto market is firmly entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this shift can be a game-changer, influencing portfolio strategies and highlighting where the smart money might be flowing. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 20 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a random figure; it’s a barometer designed to gauge the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure market view, offers insights into whether altcoins are collectively outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is dominating the market. A score of 20, as we’ve recently seen, places us squarely in Bitcoin Season territory. But what are the exact thresholds? Let’s break down how this index works: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a staggering 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This period typically sees massive gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day timeframe. A score of 20 indicates that very few altcoins are keeping pace with or surpassing Bitcoin’s performance. Neutral Zone: Scores between these two extremes suggest a more balanced or indecisive market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a clear, dominant lead. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Therefore, a score of 20 is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s current strength and the relative weakness in broader altcoin performance . Why the Shift? Unpacking the Rise of Bitcoin Dominance The move into Bitcoin Season isn’t arbitrary; it’s often a reflection of broader market dynamics and investor sentiment. Several factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance: Flight to Safety: In times of economic uncertainty or heightened volatility within the crypto space, investors often flock to Bitcoin. It’s perceived as the “digital gold” – a more stable and established asset compared to the often volatile and less liquid altcoins. Institutional Inflows: The approval and increasing adoption of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have significantly opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These large-scale investments tend to flow primarily into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and market capitalization while altcoins may see comparatively less interest. Halving Cycle Influence: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant bull runs. While the immediate effects can vary, the long-term narrative often strengthens Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events can all play a role. When traditional markets face headwinds, Bitcoin can sometimes act as a hedge, attracting capital away from riskier assets, including altcoins. This period of Bitcoin dominance suggests that capital is consolidating around the largest cryptocurrency, indicating a more cautious or foundational phase in the crypto market cycle. Investors are prioritizing stability and proven track records over the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of smaller cap altcoins. Impact on Altcoin Performance: Navigating the Challenges For investors heavily invested in altcoins, a prolonged Bitcoin Season can present significant challenges. While Bitcoin might be experiencing steady gains, many altcoins could see their values stagnate or even decline against BTC. This is not to say all altcoins will suffer equally; some may still find niche rallies, but the overall trend favors Bitcoin. What does this mean for your altcoin performance ? Decreased Liquidity: Capital flowing into Bitcoin often means less liquidity for altcoins, making it harder to enter or exit positions without impacting prices significantly. Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin’s USD value remains stable or increases slightly, its value relative to Bitcoin might decrease. This means you could have held Bitcoin and seen better returns. Increased Volatility for Some: Smaller, less established altcoins can experience heightened volatility during Bitcoin Season, as they are more susceptible to market sentiment shifts and lower trading volumes. Focus on Fundamentals: This period often serves as a “stress test” for altcoin projects. Those with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility are more likely to weather the storm and potentially emerge stronger when altcoin season eventually returns. It’s crucial for investors to understand that this isn’t necessarily a permanent state. The crypto market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are often followed by periods where altcoins shine. However, knowing which phase we are in allows for more informed decision-making. Strategies for the Current Crypto Market: Thriving in Bitcoin Season So, with the Altcoin Season Index at 20, how can investors best position themselves in the current crypto market ? Adapting your strategy to the prevailing market conditions is key. Here are some actionable insights: Rebalance Towards Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin. If your portfolio is heavily skewed towards altcoins, rebalancing could help mitigate risk and capture the gains from Bitcoin’s dominance. Research Strong Altcoin Projects: While the overall altcoin market might be struggling, this is an excellent time to research projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and clear use cases. These “gems” might be undervalued during Bitcoin Season and could offer significant returns when altcoin season returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider dollar-cost averaging into your preferred assets. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, which can reduce the impact of volatility. Consider Stablecoins: If you’re highly risk-averse, temporarily parking some capital in stablecoins can be a way to preserve capital while waiting for clearer market signals or more favorable altcoin conditions. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D). An increasing dominance suggests Bitcoin Season is in full swing, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of an altcoin resurgence. Risk Management is Paramount: Always use stop-loss orders and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and disciplined risk management is essential. Understanding the nuances of Bitcoin dominance and its implications for altcoin performance allows for a more strategic approach to investment, helping you navigate the ebbs and flows of the digital asset landscape. Is Altcoin Season Over? A Look at Future Possibilities The question on many investors’ minds is: “Is Altcoin Season truly over, or is this just a temporary pause?” The truth is, the crypto market is cyclical. While we are currently in a strong Bitcoin Season , history suggests that periods of Bitcoin dominance are often followed by periods where altcoins experience explosive growth. This cycle is driven by several factors: Profit Rotation: As Bitcoin’s price rises, investors who made significant gains often look to rotate those profits into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. This influx of capital can ignite altcoin rallies. Innovation and Narrative Shifts: New technologies, emerging narratives (e.g., AI, DePIN, Gaming), and breakthroughs within the altcoin space can attract fresh capital and spark renewed interest, regardless of Bitcoin’s immediate performance. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, more diverse use cases for altcoins emerge, attracting different types of investors and expanding the overall market capitalization beyond just Bitcoin. While the Altcoin Season Index is currently at 20, it doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant. It simply means that for the time being, Bitcoin is leading the charge. Smart investors use this period to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices, preparing for the eventual return of the altcoin boom. The key is to remain patient, continue your research, and understand that market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. The shift from Bitcoin dominance back to broader altcoin performance is often signaled by a decrease in Bitcoin Dominance and an increase in the Altcoin Season Index. Conclusion: Adapting to the Shifting Crypto Tides The recent drop of the Altcoin Season Index to 20 is a definitive indicator that the crypto market is currently navigating a period of strong Bitcoin Season . This phase, characterized by Bitcoin dominance and a challenging environment for overall altcoin performance , calls for a strategic reassessment of investment portfolios. While it may feel daunting for altcoin holders, it’s a natural and recurring part of the market cycle. By understanding the underlying reasons for this shift – from institutional inflows to macroeconomic factors – investors can make more informed decisions. Instead of viewing this as a setback, consider it an opportunity to refine your strategy: prioritize risk management, rebalance portfolios, and focus on fundamental analysis for promising altcoin projects. The crypto market is dynamic, and adapting to its changing tides is crucial for long-term success. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, the cyclical nature of the market suggests that altcoin season will eventually return, rewarding those who prepared wisely during the current phase.

2025-06-24T12:40:09,"One of the Most Hawkish FED Members, Bowman, Made a Statement: He Gave the Green Light to Cut Interest Rates! He Also Gave a Date!","While the FED is expected to start cutting interest rates, which it has been pausing since January, in order to trigger the long-awaited rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, which have been overshadowed by the Israel-Iran tension, the good news of an interest rate cut came from FED Vice Chair Michelle Bowman. Speaking at a meeting in Prague, Czech Republic, Michelle Bowman Waller said the time to cut interest rates was approaching. This marks a major change for Bowman, who has emerged as one of the most hawkish members and has been skeptical of interest rate cuts in recent months. But Bowman now made an unexpected change by saying, “It's time to think about adjusting the policy rate.” Michelle Bowman pointed out that inflation has slowed in recent months and said she would support a rate cut in July if the slowing trend in inflation continues. “Recent economic data suggest that tariffs and other policies have no clear and significant impact on inflation. At this point, the impact of the trade war on inflation may be delayed or less significant than expected. “Therefore, if the downtrend continues, I would support a rate cut next month. In the meantime, I will continue to monitor economic conditions carefully as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.” Bowman's comments echo those of his colleague Christopher Waller, who told CNBC on Friday that he thought the Fed could cut interest rates in July. Related News: Interest Rate Good News from a FED Member! Will We See a Summer Rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins? US President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates as a way to save on financing the country’s rising national debt. However, the Fed left the interest rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% at its meeting last week. While Trump thinks the Fed should cut interest rates by at least 2 percent, Bowman did not say how much the interest rate should be lowered. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. According to the CME FedWatch indicator, investors are pricing in a 22.7 percent chance of a rate cut in July and expecting rates to remain steady. However, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in September is priced in at about 78.7 percent. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-24T12:39:22,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $105,000 After President Trump Announces Israel-Iran Ceasefire","Bitcoin (BTC) made a strong recovery on Monday after spending the weekend in the doldrums as market sentiment worsened. The flagship cryptocurrency plummeted to multi-month lows after the US conducted airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, as the conflict between Israel and Iran threatened to spiral out of control. However, market sentiment turned positive after President Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% on Monday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. President Trump Announces Israel-Iran Ceasefire US President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a full ceasefire, set to begin in a few hours. The ceasefire halts what Trump referred to as “The 12-Day War” in a post on Truth Social. Trump stated that the ceasefire would unfold in two phases, with Iran observing the first 12 hours, followed by Israel. Trump also added that Iran had notified the US about the attack on its military base in Qatar and that there were no casualties. “CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in-progress, final missions!), for 12 hours at which point the war will be considered, ENDED!” The ceasefire follows a significant escalation in hostilities over the weekend as both countries intensified air attacks. The US also joined the conflict and conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Saylor Hints At Next Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Strategy, has hinted at the company’s next purchase. Saylor posted a chart highlighting Strategy’s previous Bitcoin acquisitions on X, alongside a caption stating, “Nothing Stops This Orange.” Saylor typically posts cryptic posts before a major Bitcoin purchase. Under his leadership, Strategy has established itself as the largest corporate holder of the asset, amassing 592,100 BTC worth around $60 billion at current prices. Saylor’s latest post came after an investor sued him, Strategy, and top company executives, claiming they breached their fiduciary duties before reporting a multi-billion dollar Bitcoin loss in Q1 results. According to the shareholder derivative complaint filed by Abhey Parmar in a Virginia federal court, Saylor, Strategy CEO Phong Le, financial chief Andrew Kang, and four board directors made materially false and misleading statements about an accounting practice change. According to the complainant, Strategy enacted a Financial Accounting Standards board rule that allowed corporate holders of crypto to use the estimated market value of their crypto in their balance sheets. Anthony Pompliano Raises $750M To Take Crypto Company Public Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano has raised $750 million to take his crypto firm, ProCap, public in the US by merging it with the blank-check firm Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The merged companies will debut as ProCap Financial Inc., with over $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The merger is expected to close before the end of the year, according to a statement released by both companies. Pompliano will lead the new firm once it goes public. The crypto entrepreneur stated that ProCap will focus on acquiring BTC for its balance sheet and develop products and services to generate revenue. “Today, I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial service. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC , LLC, and Columbus Circle Capital Corp I, a publicly traded SPAC. ProCap Financial will focus on acquiring bitcoin for its balance sheet while also developing products and services to produce revenue and profit from the bitcoin on our balance sheet over time.” ProCap will join several other companies that buy and hold Bitcoin, a business model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. ProCap’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of BTC will place its holdings as the eighth-largest among public firms. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week positively as bullish sentiment returned after President Trump announced that Israel and Iran announced a complete ceasefire.

The recovery came after President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. Iran had earlier completed a de-escalatory airstrike on the al-Udeid airbase, the largest American base in West Asia. BTC plunged to a low of $98,385 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened after the US launched airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. However, a strong recovery has seen the flagship cryptocurrency reclaim $105,000. BTC is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, trading around $105,035. Ethereum (ETH) has also substantially recovered, having reclaimed $2,400 and trading around $2,405. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 7% in the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) is also up over 7%, trading around $2.17. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed $140, with the price up over 8%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 8%, trading around $0.165. Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. As a result, the crypto market cap is up over 4%. Dow Jones Up 200 Points US stocks registered gains despite Iran’s attack on a US airbase in Qatar as tensions threatened to escalate yet again. Major US stock indices registered small increases despite the US entering the Israel-Iran conflict. The Dow Jones rose 270 points, while the S&P 500 registered an increase of 0.39%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up almost 1%, while oil prices fell 5%. The timing of the airstrikes on Iran, conducted when the markets were shut, could be the reason behind the market’s muted reaction. Oil traded slightly higher despite fears of drastic measures by Iran. Major Cryptocurrencies Up As President Trump Announces Ceasefire President Trump has announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, which will begin in a few hours. The ceasefire ends what Trump referred to as the “12-Day War” in a post on Truth Social. According to the post, the ceasefire will unfold in two phases, with Iran observing it for the first 12 hours, followed by Israel. Trump also stated that Iran had notified the US before launching attacks on a US military base in Qatar, adding that there were no casualties during the attack, suggesting they were de-escalatory. The ceasefire follows a significant escalation in hostilities over the weekend as both countries intensified air attacks. The US also joined the conflict and conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Recent talk of a ceasefire saw markets recover, with Bitcoin (BTC) rising over 5% after plunging below $100,000 over the weekend. Other altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP), also made substantial gains. Democratic Senator Introduces Bill Against President Trump’s Crypto Ties California Senator Adam Schiff and nine Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to prevent the “financial exploitation of digital assets” by President Trump and other Public officials. Schiff and several Democratic Senators announced the introduction of the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure, or COIN Act, in response to Trump’s entanglements with the cryptocurrency industry. The legislation comes after President Trump’s disclosure of $57.4 million in income tied to World Liberty Financial (WLF). Senator Schiff stated, “President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings have raised significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family. That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family.” Crypto ETFs Post $1.2B In Inflows Crypto investment products continued registering inflows as investor interest remained strong despite BTC and other cryptocurrencies registering notable declines. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) registered $1.24 billion in inflows for the week ending Friday, according to data sourced from CoinShares. The latest inflows allowed crypto ETPs to break year-to-date inflows and set a new historic high of over $15.1 billion. However, despite the inflows, the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs fell marginally from $179 billion to $176.3 billion. Bitcoin ETPs registered a second-consecutive week of inflows totaling over $1.1 billion, despite prices dropping to a low of $103,000 by the end of the week. According to James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, the resisting growth in the Bitcoin ETP dynamics despite a decline in spot prices indicates investors were buying on weakness. “This sentiment was further supported by minor outflows from short-Bitcoin products, which totaled $1.4 million.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp recovery after spending the weekend in the doldrums. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp decline over the weekend as market sentiment worsened as the conflict between Israel and Iran escalated. The US also entered the war, conducting precision strikes on key Iranian sites, sending the crypto market into a tailspin. As a result, BTC fell 1.17% on Saturday and plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to a low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. However, bullish sentiment returned on Monday after President Trump announced a ceasefire, with BTC surging over 4% to reclaim $105,000. BTC’s dip over the weekend saw substantial exchange outflows, with analysts from Nansen suggesting investors were buying the dip instead of panicking. Nicolai Søndergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen, stated, “We are seeing exchange outflows, so it is likely that people, regardless of being retail or institutions, are buying the dip. Generally, when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tends to be heavy short-term dips which later rebound.” BTC reclaimed $105,000 on Monday, a day after it plunged to a low of $98,385, indicating volatility. Traders are now waiting to see if BTC pushes towards $110,000 or encounters more downside risk. According to analysts, BTC and the broader crypto market could see further downsides after Qatar stated that it had reserved the right to respond to Iran’s attack. Meanwhile, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE have shut down their airspace. BTC started the previous weekend on a positive note despite plunging to an intraday low of $102,854. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. BTC was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59%, but registered a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday.
