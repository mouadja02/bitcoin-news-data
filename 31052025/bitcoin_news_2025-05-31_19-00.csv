2025-05-31T16:55:36,"Bitcoin set to rebound as BTC flashes major ‘buy signal’","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ongoing sell-off may be nearing its end, with key technical indicators signaling a potential rebound after recent selling pressure. Notably, prominent trading expert Ali Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator is flashing a major buy signal on Bitcoin’s 12-hour chart. This setup suggests a possible move above $105,000, he said in an X post on May 31. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The TD Sequential is a time-based indicator that identifies trend reversals or price exhaustion. When the system counts to “9,” it often signals that the current trend is weakening and that a reversal or correction may be imminent. Notably, Bitcoin has printed a bullish “9” candle, hinting that the recent downtrend could end and a short-term rally might be underway. If the signal plays out, Martinez believes Bitcoin could retest $105,000, a level that recently flipped from support to resistance. Bitcoin record high price target Supporting the bullish outlook, analyst Ted Pillow pointed out that the global M2 money supply, offset by 90 days, reliably forecasts Bitcoin price moves. His model predicted the May dip and now projects a sharp upward move, potentially pushing Bitcoin above $125,000 by late summer. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

According to analytics platform CryptoQuant, several demand indicators are nearing peak levels, resembling past market slowdowns. CryptoQuant indicated that Bitcoin demand has grown by approximately 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC, an area that previously marked a local top. Additionally, Bitcoin balances held by whales have risen 2.8% in the past month. Historically, such accumulation often precedes a cooling period in large-holder activity. Bitcoin demand zone.

2025-05-31T16:50:46,"US Japan Trade Deal: Trump Talks Signal Crucial Economic Shifts","BitcoinWorld US Japan Trade Deal: Trump Talks Signal Crucial Economic Shifts Recent comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump have put the spotlight back on international trade negotiations, specifically mentioning that Japan is keen on forging a new US Japan Trade Deal . This revelation, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals potential shifts in the global economic landscape. While the cryptocurrency market often seems distinct from traditional trade agreements, these high-level discussions can have ripple effects that influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and overall market stability. Understanding the dynamics of these Trump Trade Talks is crucial for anyone navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world, including the volatile realm of digital assets. Unpacking the US Japan Trade Deal Revelation The news that Japan is reportedly seeking a trade deal with the United States, as stated by Donald Trump, brings a significant economic relationship into focus. The U.S. and Japan are two of the world’s largest economies and key trading partners. A new comprehensive trade agreement could reshape various sectors, from agriculture and automotive to technology and finance. While details on the specifics of Japan’s reported proposal or the potential scope of such a deal remain limited based on Trump’s brief comment, the willingness to negotiate signals a potential evolution in bilateral economic ties. Historically, trade deals between major economies aim to reduce tariffs, eliminate non-tariff barriers, harmonize regulations, and establish frameworks for investment and intellectual property protection. The outcomes of such negotiations can: Impact the competitiveness of industries in both countries. Influence currency exchange rates. Affect consumer prices. Stimulate or constrain economic growth. For market participants, including those in the crypto space, these potential shifts create a layer of macroeconomic context that is essential to monitor. A favorable trade deal could be seen as a positive for global economic stability, potentially encouraging risk-on sentiment. Conversely, difficult negotiations or the threat of trade barriers could introduce uncertainty, potentially leading investors towards assets perceived as safer havens. How Do Trump Trade Talks Impact Global Stability? Beyond the potential US Japan Trade Deal , Donald Trump’s comments also reportedly touched upon discussions with other nations, specifically mentioning India and Pakistan. This broader context of Trump Trade Talks highlights his continued interest and potential influence on international economic relations, even outside of a presidential capacity. While the nature and depth of these reported talks are not fully clear, any dialogue involving major global players like the U.S., Japan, India, and Pakistan carries geopolitical weight. Global stability is a critical factor influencing financial markets. Trade disputes, diplomatic tensions, or shifts in international alliances can trigger volatility across asset classes. During periods of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, investors often re-evaluate their portfolios, sometimes moving away from riskier assets towards more traditional safe havens like gold or certain government bonds. The narrative around cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential ‘digital gold’ or hedge against traditional financial system instability, means they are not immune to these global dynamics. Consider the potential scenarios: Successful Negotiations: Deals reached smoothly could signal cooperation and stability, potentially boosting overall market confidence. Protracted or Difficult Talks: Lingering uncertainty or the threat of failed negotiations can create market jitters. New Trade Barriers: Imposing tariffs or restrictions can disrupt supply chains and economic growth, often leading to negative market reactions. These outcomes directly feed into the overall risk appetite of investors, which in turn influences capital allocation decisions, including exposure to cryptocurrencies. The Global Trade Impact on Financial Markets Major trade agreements and the discussions surrounding them have a tangible Global Trade Impact that resonates across traditional financial markets before potentially influencing crypto. Stock markets often react to news about trade deals, with sectors poised to benefit seeing gains and those potentially harmed experiencing declines. Currency markets are particularly sensitive, as trade balances and capital flows directly affect exchange rates. Bond yields can also fluctuate based on expectations of economic growth and inflation influenced by trade policies. Let’s look at some direct and indirect impacts: Currency Strength: A trade deal perceived as beneficial for the U.S. economy could strengthen the dollar, while benefits for Japan could boost the Yen. Currency fluctuations impact the purchasing power of international investors looking at dollar-denominated assets like many cryptocurrencies. Inflation Expectations: Reduced tariffs can lower import costs, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Conversely, trade barriers can increase costs. Inflation expectations are a key driver for assets like Bitcoin, which some view as an inflation hedge. Economic Growth Projections: Trade deals aim to stimulate economic activity. Positive growth outlooks generally favor risk assets, including equities and potentially cryptocurrencies. Supply Chain Adjustments: Companies may restructure supply chains based on new trade rules, impacting global logistics and costs, which can have broader economic implications. The sensitivity of traditional markets to trade news means that significant developments in Trump Trade Talks or the potential US Japan Trade Deal will likely be priced into stocks, bonds, and currencies first. These movements then contribute to the overall market sentiment that spills over into the crypto space. What Does Crypto Market Geopolitics Mean for Your Portfolio? The concept of Crypto Market Geopolitics explores how international relations, political events, and economic policies influence the cryptocurrency landscape. While often touted as decentralized and independent, the crypto market operates within the real world’s financial ecosystem and is subject to the forces that shape it. Trade deals and geopolitical events like those hinted at by Trump’s comments can affect the crypto market in several ways: Geopolitical/Trade Factor Potential Crypto Impact Explanation Increased Global Uncertainty (e.g., trade tensions) Increased demand for perceived safe havens (Bitcoin) OR flight from risk assets (altcoins, even BTC) Depending on the narrative at the time, investors may seek BTC as ‘digital gold’ or simply reduce exposure to all volatile assets. Positive Economic Outlook (e.g., successful trade deal) Increased risk-on sentiment, potential capital inflow into crypto Stronger global economy can encourage investment in growth-oriented or speculative assets. Currency Volatility Increased interest in stablecoins or non-sovereign assets like BTC People in regions experiencing currency devaluation may turn to crypto as an alternative store of value or medium of exchange. Regulatory Responses Potential shifts in crypto regulation driven by national economic interests Countries might accelerate or alter crypto regulations based on their position in the global economic order and trade relationships. Therefore, staying informed about major geopolitical and trade developments, such as the potential US Japan Trade Deal and other Trump Trade Talks , is not just for traditional investors. It’s an integral part of understanding the broader market context that can significantly influence crypto prices and trends. Navigating Economic Policy Shifts: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the interconnectedness of global finance, changes in Economic Policy , whether through trade deals, monetary policy, or fiscal stimulus, inevitably create ripples that reach the crypto market. For crypto investors, this isn’t about becoming a trade expert, but rather recognizing how these macro forces can impact investment decisions and portfolio management. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Macro News: Pay attention to major economic announcements, central bank decisions, and significant geopolitical developments like trade negotiations. Resources like reputable financial news outlets and economic calendars are valuable. Understand Correlation Dynamics: Observe how cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are correlating with traditional assets (like stocks or gold) during different economic climates. Sometimes Bitcoin acts like a tech stock, sometimes like a safe haven. Diversify Your Portfolio (Within Crypto and Beyond): Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different crypto assets with varying use cases and market caps. Also, think about your overall asset allocation across traditional and digital assets based on your risk tolerance and view of the macroeconomic environment. Develop a Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be driven by news events, the long-term trajectory of cryptocurrencies is more likely to be influenced by fundamental adoption, technological development, and broader shifts in the financial system. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on immediate reactions to trade news. Consider Hedging Strategies: Depending on your expertise and risk profile, explore strategies that might help hedge against potential market downturns driven by macroeconomic factors. The potential for a new US Japan Trade Deal , alongside other reported Trump Trade Talks , serves as a reminder that external economic and political factors are powerful forces in the global financial system. Ignoring them means missing a significant part of the picture that influences the environment in which cryptocurrencies trade. Benefits of Monitoring Global Trade Developments: Better understanding of overall market sentiment (risk-on vs. risk-off). Ability to anticipate potential shifts in currency strength or inflation expectations. Insight into factors that might drive institutional investment decisions. Improved context for analyzing price movements in relation to external catalysts. Challenges: News can be speculative or lack detail, making it hard to assess true impact. The relationship between trade news and crypto can be indirect and complex. Market reactions can be unpredictable and driven by multiple factors simultaneously. Ultimately, successful navigation of the crypto market involves more than just analyzing blockchain data or project whitepapers. It requires a holistic view that includes understanding the major macroeconomic and geopolitical forces at play. The reported desire for a US Japan Trade Deal and the mention of broader Trump Trade Talks are prime examples of the kind of global developments that warrant attention from the informed crypto investor. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in a Connected World The revelation that Japan is reportedly seeking a US Japan Trade Deal , as mentioned by Donald Trump alongside other Trump Trade Talks , underscores the constant movement in global economic and political spheres. These discussions have a direct Global Trade Impact on traditional markets and contribute to the broader environment that shapes Crypto Market Geopolitics . While the direct line between a trade negotiation and the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum might not always be immediately obvious, the indirect influences through changes in market sentiment, economic outlook, and regulatory considerations are undeniable. Understanding how major shifts in Economic Policy and international relations can affect financial stability and investor behavior is crucial for anyone participating in the digital asset space. As the crypto market matures, its integration with the traditional financial system increases, making it more susceptible to the same macroeconomic winds that have always driven global markets. Staying informed, maintaining a diversified perspective, and focusing on long-term trends while being aware of potential short-term catalysts from global events are key strategies for navigating this complex and ever-evolving landscape.

2025-05-31T16:48:06,"Wells Fargo Reportedly Rejects Reimbursement After $44,000 Drained From Accounts – Until Questions Surface in the Media","Wells Fargo reportedly refused to refund customers who recently had their accounts drained by scammers – until the bank began facing questions from the media. Houston resident Heather Sanders was defrauded for $4,000, while in a separate incident, Texas couple Jose and Amanda Vasquez had $40,000 stolen from their business account, reports FOX 26. In both cases, Wells Fargo reportedly denied the victims’ claims until the media investigated the incidents. The bank changed its rulings on both cases and has now reimbursed what was stolen from the accounts. Sanders says she received a call bearing Wells Fargo’s phone number. Sanders says the person on the other line convinced her that her account was at risk, with someone trying to move funds out of her account and into Zelle. During the call, Sanders says the thief asked her to input her old PIN into her phone and enter a new PIN twice before hitting the pound sign. She also says that the scammer told her to cut her debit card, place it inside an envelope and wait for a courier to pick it up. “I made the mistake, I didn’t cut the chip in half. I just cut the card in half like he said.” The thieves ended up plundering her account, withdrawing over $4,000 from different locations, including a Wells Fargo ATM. Sanders abruptly sought the assistance of Wells Fargo to recover her funds, but the bank denied her request for reimbursement. However, Wells Fargo reopened the matter after the media reported on the story and then reimbursed her. In the Vasquez case, the couple noticed someone had attempted to set up a direct transfer for $20,000 and asked the bank to stop the transfer. Not only did the transfer go through, but another $20,000 transfer did as well. The couple says they don’t understand why Wells Fargo allowed the second $20,000 transfer to go through when they had already been alerted of the first fraudulent transaction. After filing a claim, Wells Fargo said it detected no fraud in the disappearance of their money, declaring the investigation closed. But soon after the media reported on the incident, the couple says the bank made them whole.

2025-05-31T16:39:47,"Expert Outlines Six Big Developments Coming For XRP","Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and well-known XRP advocate, took to X to outline what he sees as the path ahead for the digital asset. Many notable developments in XRP’s future have the community excited, and Farina highlighted key ones that could be game-changers. The End of XRP’s Legal Troubles The most exciting development in XRP’s immediate future is the resolution of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In late March, the SEC agreed to withdraw its appeal against Ripple . Both parties have been working to dismiss the lawsuit legally. This agreement will remove the permanent injunction preventing XRP sales to institutions and lower Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million . They recently faced a setback as Judge Annalisa Torres rejected the settlement agreement filed by the SEC due to a procedural error. The community is eagerly awaiting the next steps and the resolution of the legal battle, as it would provide legal clarity for XRP in the U.S., which most digital assets don’t have. Here's what awaits for $XRP : – SEC lawsuit officially over – Legal clarity in the U.S while most Cryptos are still in limbo – BTC maxis are starting to FOMO in – Set to replace SWIFT as the global payment standard – Helping governments build their CBDCs – Reserve Currency pic.twitter.com/mfgwmxTcJg — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 30, 2025 XRP’s Potential Shines Through According to Farina, XRP is gaining traction among skeptics, including Bitcoin maximalists. Davinci Jeremie, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently predicted that XRP will rise to $24 by the end of 2025 , showing that even Bitcoin maximalists can see XRP’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A New Global Payment Standard Farina also reiterated the long-standing position among XRP supporters that the asset is poised to challenge or replace SWIFT, the dominant messaging system used by banks for international payments. XRP’s underlying technology enables the direct transfer of value without the delays and fees associated with traditional systems. The increasing demand for faster and more transparent payment networks could open the door for XRP to take on SWIFT’s role. CBDC Infrastructure and Reserve Currency Goals Another significant point made by Farina is XRP’s ongoing involvement with central banks in developing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). France has shown interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for this purpose, and Ripple has been working with the National Bank of Georgia on a CBDC project since 2023. The XRP Ledger has been piloting programs and exploratory projects to test the feasibility of CBDC issuance. This process could aid XRP’s global expansion, adoption, and influence. XRP’s role as a CBDC could also enhance its standing as a neutral bridge currency between fiat systems, helping it achieve its goal of becoming a global reserve currency —the final development highlighted by Farina.

2025-05-31T16:36:43,"Insurance firms prepare to offer kidnapping and ransom insurance","Many digital asset investors have decided to ensure safety by investing in kidnapping and ransom (K&R) policies. Crypto investors were seeking K&R policies due to increased physical attacks witnessed in recent months. Insurance firms have been preparing these policies for crypto investors. As per a report by NBC, there has been an increase in violent attacks on crypto investors over the last few months. Investors have sought crypto insurance and security from insurance companies. At least three insurance companies have started preparing kidnapping and ransom policies. Digital asset owners experience physical and digital attacks 🇺🇸CRYPTO INVESTOR TURNED TORTURE KINGPIN IN NYC HORROR PAD A Kentucky crypto bro allegedly turned a $40K/month SoHo rental into a full-blown torture chamber to extort millions from an Italian tourist. Police say John Woeltz bound the man for 2 weeks, electrocuted him,… pic.twitter.com/55pZIm3g3G — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) May 24, 2025 Rebecca Rubenfeld, AnchorWatch’s Chief Operating Officer, recently said the firm was preparing to offer kidnapping and ransom protection. Rubenfeld added that the fear of violence was a main topic at the recent annual Bitcoin Conference. The COO stated that many crypto investors were nervous due to increased attacks on crypto holders. An Italian tourist was recently tortured for several weeks in Manhattan to access his Bitcoin. John Woeltz, the suspected kidnapper, was arrested and arraigned in court for kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and physical assault. Coinbase recently said thieves stole customer information belonging to over 70,000 clients. Coinbase said some customers had already been tricked out of their crypto holdings. In a recent filing with the U.S. SEC, Coinbase revealed that it had received an extortion email from criminals who had accessed customers’ names, government identification, contact information, and addresses. The crypto exchange added that the criminals had also obtained customers’ transactional history and some digits of their Social Security numbers. The crypto exchange revealed that the thieves tried to extort it for over $20 million. Coinbase clarified that it would not pay the amount demanded by the criminals. The exchange said it would instead offer a $20 million bounty for details that would lead to the arrest of the criminals. Insurance firms prepare to offer K&R insurance Ryan Lackey, the CEO of Evertas Insurance, said the right protection for wealthy crypto holders was to have physical security. Lackey added that digital asset wonders should also make it public that they could only access a particular portion of the funds. The CEO stated that most of their digital assets should be guarded with passwords and stored in secure locations such as safety deposit boxes and banks. Lackey said Evertas advises clients to opt for kidnapping and ransom insurance. The CEO revealed that the firm was considering how best to provide K&R insurance. The vice president of executive risk at Hylant Capital, Andrew Kurt, said he was not amazed to see many crypto firms providing kidnapping and ransom insurance. Kurt revealed that K&R insurance was lucrative, given how relatively few digital asset owners get kidnapped. The vice president said K&R has been profitable for insurance firms even though its premiums were very small. Kurt explained that losses in the K&R insurance business were few. The vice president also said that what had happened in the crypto industry would not become a frequent issue. Kurt added that the few kidnapping and ransom cases would just be more of a severity issue. Joseph Ziolkowski, the Chief Executive Officer at Relm, said his firm has been considering launching K&R insurance. Ziolkowski revealed that the process of preparing K&R insurance was a bit complicated. The CEO stated that the firm would need to evaluate the client’s cyber and physical security before offering K&R insurance. Ziolkowski added that there would be a base rate for pricing the K&R coverage. The CEO clarified that the base rate would be debited and credited according to favorable or unfavorable circumstances tied to a particular risk. Ziolkowski said if the client has full-time security details that travel with them at all times, that would obviously be a credit, impacting the premium.

2025-05-31T16:30:53,"Historic: Texas Senate Advances Crucial Bitcoin Bill (SB 21)","BitcoinWorld Historic: Texas Senate Advances Crucial Bitcoin Bill (SB 21) Texas, the Lone Star State, is once again making significant moves in the world of finance, and this time, it involves the digital frontier. Recent developments from Austin signal a potentially groundbreaking shift in how state finances might interact with decentralized digital assets. What’s Happening with the Texas Bitcoin Bill? Big news from the Texas Senate! They’ve officially adopted the Conference Committee report for the Texas Bitcoin Bill , known as SB 21. This wasn’t a split decision; the vote was a decisive 24:7 in favor. This critical step brings the bill significantly closer to becoming law. The next and final hurdle is obtaining the signature of the Texas governor. The adoption of this report indicates strong legislative support for integrating Bitcoin into the state’s financial strategy. Introducing the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A key component of the newly adopted SB 21 is the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This initiative is designed to serve as a legal framework allowing the state government to potentially include Bitcoin as a reserve asset within its public finances. Think of it as a modern twist on traditional reserve strategies, acknowledging the growing importance and potential value of digital assets in the global economy. The SBR plan aims to diversify state holdings and explore new avenues for managing public funds. Why is Texas Considering State Bitcoin Investment? Texas is a powerhouse economy, second only to California in the U.S. If it were a country, it would rank as the eighth-largest economy globally. Given this economic might, any move into new asset classes is significant. The potential for Texas State Bitcoin Investment is rooted in several factors. Proponents often cite Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, its role in attracting innovation and crypto businesses to the state, and the long-term growth potential of digital assets. Embracing Bitcoin could position Texas as a leader in the digital economy landscape. Exploring the Implications of Bitcoin in Texas The move towards allowing Bitcoin in Texas state finances has wide-ranging implications. It signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency at higher levels of government. For the crypto industry, it could mean increased legitimacy and potentially attract more businesses and talent to the state. For Texans, it could mean their state’s financial health is tied, in part, to the performance of Bitcoin. However, it also raises questions about volatility, security, and the best practices for managing a digital asset reserve. Here are some potential impacts and considerations: Economic Development: Attracting blockchain and crypto companies. Inflation Hedge: Potential protection against the devaluation of traditional currencies. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to state reserves. Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations could impact reserve value. Custody and Security: Ensuring the safe storage of digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: Setting a precedent for other states. What’s Next for SB 21 Texas? With the Senate’s adoption of the Conference Committee report, the focus now shifts to the Governor’s office. For SB 21 Texas to become law, it requires the Governor’s signature. While legislative approval is a major hurdle cleared, the final step is crucial. If signed, Texas will officially have the legal framework in place to explore Bitcoin investment and establish its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This development is being watched closely by the crypto community and other states considering similar legislative steps. In Conclusion: A Bold Step for the Lone Star State The Texas Senate’s adoption of the SB 21 Conference Committee report marks a significant moment for cryptocurrency adoption within U.S. state governments. By paving the way for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and state investment, Texas is taking a bold step into the future of finance. While potential challenges exist, the legislative progress demonstrates a clear interest in leveraging digital assets. This move could set a precedent for other states and further solidify Bitcoin’s place in the broader financial landscape.

2025-05-31T16:15:00,"White House in the memecoin business — and the SEC’s not watching","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is officially stepping back from regulating memecoins, essentially leaving investors on their own when it comes to volatile tokens like $TRUMP — a memecoin closely tied to President Donald Trump and his expanding crypto empire. In comments this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce made it clear that the agency does not view these tokens as securities and will not offer guidance or protection to traders. The move underscores a dramatic shift in Washington’s approach to crypto under Trump, whose own token soared to a $15 billion market cap earlier this year before crashing. With 80% of $TRUMP reportedly held by Trump-affiliated entities, critics warn that the business has glaring conflicts of interest — and a regulatory vacuum as the president’s family profits from a financial product now officially outside the SEC’s reach. You might also like: Analysts predict XMR and XYZ could see 3x gains due to strong Bitcoin market correlation Peirce compares meme coins to NFT market dynamics In an interview with CNBC, Peirce compared the current meme coin situation to the 2021 non-fungible token (NFT) boom. She noted that while NFTs weren’t classified as securities, they still experienced major price fluctuations driven by market speculation. The commissioner suggested the SEC missed an opportunity to provide clearer public guidance during that period. “Here was something where I saw a lot of interest in this out in the world — in meme coins — and it made sense for us to say, ‘People if you are expecting that there’s SEC protection around these, you should not expect that,'” Peirce said. The commissioner emphasized that while virtually any asset can be structured as a securities transaction, investors should understand that meme coins operate outside traditional regulatory safeguards. Her message to market participants was clear: proceed with full awareness of the risks involved. Since Trump’s inauguration, the SEC has adopted a different approach to cryptocurrency enforcement. The administration has moved away from the aggressive regulatory stance of the previous leadership. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest that stemmed from the Trump family’s crypto holdings. Peirce defended the agency’s changing approach and cited the absence of clear regulatory frameworks during earlier enforcement actions. “We didn’t have a clear set of rules,” she explained.

Understanding whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or altcoins is crucial. The latest data from a key metric provides a clear signal: we are currently in Bitcoin Season. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index, a widely referenced metric provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the state of the crypto market. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin, or if Bitcoin is leading the pack. Here’s a breakdown of how the index works: It tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The index looks at performance over the past 90 days. An index score is calculated based on the percentage of these top 100 altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window. The index ranges from 1 to 100, with specific thresholds defining the ‘season’: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days (Index score of 75 or higher). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days (Index score of 25 or lower). Neither Season: The period in between, where performance is mixed (Index score between 26 and 74). As of 00:33 UTC on May 31, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 16. This figure, down six points from the previous day, falls well below the 25 threshold, definitively signaling that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Implications for Your Portfolio When the market is in Bitcoin Season, it typically means that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is holding its value significantly better than most altcoins. This can happen for several reasons: Risk-Off Sentiment: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer haven within the crypto space compared to more speculative altcoins. Major Bitcoin Events: Events like the Bitcoin halving, significant institutional adoption news, or regulatory clarity often drive interest and investment specifically into BTC. Early Cycle Accumulation: In the early stages of a bull run, Bitcoin often leads the charge, with altcoins catching up later. Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) tends to increase during these periods. For investors, Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Many altcoins may see stagnant or declining prices relative to Bitcoin. Finding profitable trades among altcoins becomes more difficult. Portfolios heavily weighted towards altcoins may underperform a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio. Opportunities: Focusing on Bitcoin accumulation may be a prudent strategy. Identifying altcoins that show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season could highlight potential future leaders. It can be a good time to research and understand promising altcoin projects for when the season eventually shifts. Understanding Altcoin Performance During This Phase With the Altcoin Season Index at 16, it explicitly states that only a small fraction (16% or fewer) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. This poor Altcoin Performance is characteristic of Bitcoin Season. What factors contribute to this? Lower Liquidity: Capital is concentrated in Bitcoin, leaving less liquidity for smaller altcoin markets, making them more susceptible to price drops. Investor Sentiment: As Bitcoin rises, investors may sell altcoins to increase their Bitcoin holdings or simply lose interest in altcoins that aren’t keeping pace. Project Development Cycles: While altcoin projects continue developing, major breakthroughs or news might not be enough to counteract the prevailing market sentiment favoring Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that not all altcoins will perform identically during Bitcoin Season. Some may still post gains due to project-specific news, technological advancements, or unique market niches. However, the index confirms that this is not the widespread outperformance seen during Altcoin Season. Future Crypto Market Trends: When Could the Season Shift? The crypto market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season does not last forever. Historically, periods of strong Bitcoin performance are often followed by periods where altcoins catch up and even surpass Bitcoin’s gains, leading to Altcoin Season. Several factors could signal a potential shift in Crypto Market Trends: Bitcoin Price Stabilization: When Bitcoin’s rapid price appreciation slows down or enters a consolidation phase, investors may look to deploy profits into potentially higher-growth altcoins. Increased Risk Appetite: A general improvement in macroeconomic conditions or a surge in confidence within the crypto space can encourage investors to move into riskier assets like altcoins. Major Altcoin Catalysts: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s developments), successful project launches, or widespread adoption of specific altcoins can attract substantial capital. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained trend of Bitcoin’s market cap percentage decreasing relative to the total crypto market cap is a strong indicator of altcoins gaining ground. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself is the most direct way to track this potential shift. A gradual increase towards the ‘Neither Season’ range (above 25) and eventually towards the ‘Altcoin Season’ threshold (75) would confirm the change in market dynamics. The Cryptocurrency Index as a Tool for Investors The Altcoin Season Index, along with other Cryptocurrency Index tools and metrics, provides valuable context for investment decisions. While no single index can predict the future, understanding the current market phase offers actionable insights. During Bitcoin Season (like now, with the index at 16): Prioritize research into solid, established altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, rather than chasing speculative, low-cap coins. Consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. Be patient with altcoin holdings, understanding that they may not see significant gains until the season shifts. Conversely, when the index signals a shift towards Altcoin Season: Review your research on promising altcoins. Consider rebalancing your portfolio to potentially capitalize on higher Altcoin Performance. Be mindful of increased volatility in the altcoin market. Using the Altcoin Season Index as part of a broader market analysis strategy can help investors make more informed decisions aligned with prevailing Crypto Market Trends. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Cryptocurrency Index Insights The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at a low 16, a clear indicator that the crypto market is in a period of Bitcoin dominance. This Bitcoin Season means that most altcoins are underperforming relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While this presents challenges for altcoin holders, it is a normal phase in the cyclical nature of the market. Understanding the implications of this low Altcoin Season Index is key. It suggests focusing on research, potentially accumulating Bitcoin, and being patient with altcoin investments until market conditions change. Keep a close eye on the index and broader Crypto Market Trends for signals of a potential shift back towards widespread Altcoin Performance and the return of Altcoin Season. Armed with insights from this vital Cryptocurrency Index, you can better navigate the market’s current phase.

2025-05-31T16:08:00,"BlackRock’s IBIT Sees $430M Outflow, Ending 31-Day Inflow Streak","Key Takeaways: BlackRock’s IBIT ended its 31-day inflow streak with a record $430.8M outflow. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $616.1M in outflows on May 30 amid growing market caution. Bitcoin is consolidating below $110K, with rising volatility signals and key breakout zones in focus. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a sharp reversal on May 30, recording $430.8 million in outflows and ending a 31-day inflow streak — the longest since the fund’s launch in January. According to Farside data , this marks IBIT’s largest daily outflow to date, surpassing the previous record of $418.1 million on February 26. The pullback comes after a strong month in which BlackRock accumulated nearly $6.2 billion in new Bitcoin holdings. IBIT Holds $70 Billion in Bitcoin ETF analyst Nate Geraci commented on the sudden shift, writing on X: “What a run over the past 30+ days, though.” He noted that IBIT now holds roughly $70 billion in Bitcoin, calling the figure “ridiculous” given the fund’s relatively short history. iShares Bitcoin ETF no outflows streak comes to an end… $400+mil exits fund. What a run over past 30+ days though. IBIT now pushing $70bil in assets *$70bil* Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 31, 2025 Across the broader U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market, the story was similar. The group of 11 funds posted $616.1 million in net outflows on May 30, marking a second consecutive day of redemptions. The previous day, May 29, saw $346.8 million in outflows, breaking a 10-day inflow streak. Interestingly, BlackRock bucked the trend on May 29 by recording an inflow while other issuers saw redemptions. “Every other issuer saw red. BlackRock kept buying… big brain energy right there,” Master Ventures founder Kyle Chasse commented. Chasse suggested the recent sell-off wasn’t driven by retail panic but reflected a “quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” Despite the recent ETF activity, Bitcoin’s spot price remains under pressure. BTC is trading at $103,700, down 2.27% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. In the week ending May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs had posted $2.75 billion in inflows. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $110K Bitcoin is consolidating near key levels after its recent all-time high, with traders closely watching for signals of the next major move, according to Hyblock Capital’s latest market report. In a recent note shared with Cryptonews.com, Hyblock CEO Shubh Varma noted that Open Interest (OI) remains elevated in the 95th percentile, while combined order book liquidity is at 96%, reflecting a market primed for volatility. “The longer this range holds, the greater the odds of a sharp breakout or stop hunt,” Varma said. Retail stop-losses are reportedly concentrated at the edges of the current range, making them potential targets for liquidity-driven wicks. On Binance, resistance is building between $109.5K–$110.5K, while key support lies at $105K–$105.5K. A break below could open the door to $98K. A similar structure is forming on Bybit, with notable resistance at $110.5K–$111K and support zones mirroring Binance. Varma highlighted a shift in sentiment, with retail longs at 48% and leverage flipping to short-heavy positioning. This setup may fuel increased volatility if impatient traders rush into new positions. “The passive order book is highly stacked, and leverage indicators are leaning bearish,” Varma said. However, retail positioning near the 48% long mark has previously coincided with bullish reversals.

2025-05-31T16:00:38,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Warns US Economy Headed for ‘Terrible Outcome’ if Deficit Isn’t Slashed, Recommends ‘3 Percent Solution’: Report","Billionaire investor and founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, is reportedly pushing a solution to slash America’s deficit that he says will help the US government avoid an economic calamity. In a New York Times interview, Dalio says his “3% solution” will result in a massive improvement to America’s financial picture. “The 3% solution is very practical. It has worked many times in many places, most recently in the US from 1991 to 1998.” The so-called “3% solution” calls for lowering the annual deficit-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio down to 3%, from around 7%. Dalio says the US can achieve the 3% ratio by implementing three simultaneous measures: cut spending, raise tax revenue and lower interest rates. However, Dalio warns that it may take more calamitous impacts of the debt crisis before politicians act. “All the political decision makers on both sides of the aisle that I spoke with agree that we are likely headed for a terrible outcome if the deficit isn’t cut down to about 3% of GDP. So I feel it’s like being on a boat headed for the rocks in which everyone agrees that we will crash if we don’t change our course, but they’re too hung up arguing which way to turn… The forcing mechanism will likely be a debt crisis and all that goes with it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-31T16:00:11,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls: A Critical Look at Neutral Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls: A Critical Look at Neutral Market Sentiment Have you been watching the market lately? If so, you might have noticed a subtle shift in the overall mood. The widely followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular gauge of market psychology, recently dropped to the 50 mark, placing it squarely in the ‘Neutral’ zone. This change from the ‘Greed’ territory signals a potential cooling off or a period of uncertainty in the market. But what does this neutral stance really tell us about the state of cryptocurrency news and future Bitcoin price movements? What Does the Shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signify? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, developed by Alternative, is designed to provide a snapshot of the general sentiment pervading the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear (Often indicates undervaluation and a potential buying opportunity) 25-49: Fear 50: Neutral (Represents a balance between fear and greed, often a period of uncertainty or consolidation) 51-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed (Often indicates overvaluation and a potential correction) The recent move from a higher ‘Greed’ score (it was 60 the day before) down to 50 signifies that some of the recent bullish momentum or overly optimistic sentiment has subsided. A neutral reading suggests that investors are neither excessively fearful nor excessively greedy. This can be interpreted in several ways: perhaps the market is taking a breather, waiting for a clear catalyst, or facing conflicting signals that prevent a strong lean in either direction. Understanding Crypto Market Sentiment : More Than Just a Number The value of the index lies in its attempt to quantify something as intangible as market sentiment. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a combination of six weighted factors, aiming to capture the overall feeling of market participants: Volatility (25%): High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market suggest greed; low volumes in a negative market suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzing keywords and hashtags on platforms like Twitter to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): Polling crypto investors (though this factor is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance can signal fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing search queries related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to see public interest levels. When the index moves, it’s because the aggregate signal from these factors has shifted. The move to ‘Neutral’ suggests a more balanced input from these indicators compared to the previous day when ‘Greed’ signals were stronger. Understanding these underlying factors helps you see that the index is a composite view, not just one data point. How the Index Relates to Bitcoin Price Movements It’s crucial to understand that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, historically, extreme readings on the index have sometimes coincided with significant price points. Extreme Fear can occur near market bottoms, when panic selling is rampant, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. Conversely, Extreme Greed can appear near market tops, fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which might signal a good time to be cautious or take profits. The current ‘Neutral’ reading is less clear-cut. It doesn’t strongly suggest an imminent pump or dump. Instead, it aligns with a market phase where Bitcoin price might consolidate, trade sideways, or experience moderate fluctuations as sentiment remains balanced. It tells us that the strong emotional biases that often drive sharp price movements (either up or down) are currently less dominant. While Bitcoin dominance is a factor in the index itself, the index as a whole is often correlated with Bitcoin’s major price swings, given its market-leading position. A neutral index often reflects a period where the directional conviction for Bitcoin price is weak among the general market participants. Navigating Cryptocurrency News and the Index Cryptocurrency news plays a significant role in shaping market sentiment and, consequently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Major news events can quickly swing the index from Fear to Greed or vice versa. Positive News: Announcements about institutional adoption, favorable regulations, technological advancements, or major partnerships often fuel optimism and push the index towards Greed. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, security vulnerabilities, or macroeconomic concerns can trigger panic and drive the index towards Fear. When the index is neutral, it might suggest that the recent flow of cryptocurrency news has been mixed, or that the market is digesting information without a strong, unified emotional response. It’s a reminder that staying informed about the latest developments is key, as news can be the catalyst that pushes the index out of neutrality. Actionable Insights for Investing in Crypto So, how should this ‘Neutral’ reading influence your approach to investing in crypto? Here are some actionable insights: Benefits of Using the Index: Gauges Market Psychology: It provides a quick visual cue of whether the market is predominantly fearful or greedy. Contrarian Indicator: Extreme readings can be useful prompts for contrarian thinking (buy when others are fearful, be cautious when others are greedy). Supplements Analysis: It’s a valuable tool to use alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (project roadmaps, adoption rates). Challenges of Relying Solely on the Index: Not a Guarantee: A high greed score doesn’t guarantee a crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Backward-Looking: It reflects *current* sentiment based on recent data, not necessarily future price movements. Doesn’t Explain ‘Why’: It tells you *what* the sentiment is, but not *why* it is that way, which requires deeper research into cryptocurrency news and market events. Actionable Steps: Use it as One Tool: Don’t make buy or sell decisions based *only* on the index. Stay Disciplined: A neutral index is a good time to stick to your long-term investment plan, like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), rather than being swayed by extreme emotions. Observe for Shifts: Pay attention if the index starts to move decisively towards either Fear or Greed, as this could signal changing market dynamics worth investigating further. Educate Yourself: Understand the factors behind the index and how different types of cryptocurrency news impact sentiment. Investing in crypto always involves risk. A neutral index reading suggests a period where caution and balanced analysis are particularly important. Summary: Navigating the Neutral Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index sitting at 50, in the ‘Neutral’ zone, indicates a market that is currently balanced between optimism and pessimism. This shift from recent ‘Greed’ reflects a potential pause or uncertainty among investors, influenced by various factors like volatility, volume, and cryptocurrency news. While the index is a helpful gauge of market sentiment and can offer contrarian insights at extremes, it is not a crystal ball for Bitcoin price or altcoin movements. For effective investing in crypto, use the index as a supplementary tool alongside thorough research and a disciplined strategy. The neutral zone is a reminder to stay balanced in your approach, just as the market sentiment currently appears to be.

2025-05-31T15:50:13,"Hyperliquid Whale Suffers Shocking $73M Loss: A Deep Dive into James Wynn’s Trades","BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Suffers Shocking $73M Loss: A Deep Dive into James Wynn’s Trades The world of cryptocurrency trading is known for its volatility and high stakes. While stories of massive gains often capture headlines, significant losses are also a reality, especially for those playing at the highest levels. Recently, a prominent trader on the Hyperliquid platform, known as a Hyperliquid whale , experienced a staggering setback. What Led to This Massive Crypto Trading Loss? Data circulating in the crypto community highlights a dramatic crypto trading loss incurred by a trader identified as James Wynn. According to figures tracked by HyperDash, a platform monitoring Hyperliquid activity, Wynn reportedly lost a colossal $73.34 million over a mere seven-day period. This eye-watering figure serves as a stark reminder of the immense risks involved in the fast-paced decentralized finance (DeFi) trading environment, particularly when employing high leverage. Diving into James Wynn’s Leveraged Crypto Trading Strategy The significant loss is primarily attributed to James Wynn’s aggressive leveraged crypto trading strategy. At the time the data was reported, he held substantial long positions on two volatile assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and PEPE. Here’s a breakdown of the reported positions: Bitcoin (BTC) Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $105,554. The liquidation price for this position was set at $103,242. PEPE Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $0.0129. The liquidation price for this position was $0.0114. A 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital, Wynn was effectively controlling $40 worth of the underlying asset. While this amplifies potential profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses if the market turns. The small difference between the entry price and the liquidation price on both positions underscores just how precarious highly leveraged trades can be. Who is This Hyperliquid Whale? In cryptocurrency markets, a “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. Being identified as a Hyperliquid whale suggests James Wynn commands substantial capital and actively engages in large-scale trades on the platform. His recent James Wynn loss puts a spotlight on the sheer scale of capital that moves within these high-frequency trading venues. Whales often have a notable impact due to their ability to place massive orders that can move the order book. However, as this case illustrates, even whales are not immune to the market’s unforgiving nature, especially when utilizing high leverage. The Risks Amplified by Bitcoin Price Drop (and other market movements) While the data doesn’t specify the exact market movements that triggered the loss, it’s clear that adverse price action in Bitcoin and PEPE, potentially including a significant Bitcoin price drop or downward movement towards liquidation levels, played a critical role. With 40x leverage, a relatively small percentage drop in the asset’s price translates into a massive percentage loss on the trader’s principal capital. For instance, on a 40x leveraged long position, a drop of just 2.5% in the asset’s price can wipe out 100% of the initial margin used for that position (100% / 40 = 2.5%). The reported liquidation prices being so close to the entry prices confirm this extreme sensitivity to market fluctuations. Understanding the Dangers of High Leverage Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to increase their exposure to an asset with less capital upfront. However, it is a double-edged sword. The potential benefits of amplified gains are directly mirrored by the risks of amplified losses. Here are key dangers: Amplified Losses: The most significant risk. Small adverse price movements can lead to substantial losses that quickly exceed initial margin. Increased Liquidation Risk: High leverage brings your liquidation price closer to your entry price, making your position vulnerable to even minor market retracements. Margin Calls: Platforms may require additional funds (margin calls) to maintain a position if the market moves against you. Failure to meet a margin call results in liquidation. Emotional Stress: The high stakes and rapid potential for loss can lead to poor decision-making driven by fear or panic. Actionable Insights: Navigating Leveraged Trading Responsibly While the case of this Hyperliquid whale highlights the extreme end of potential losses, it offers valuable lessons for any trader considering or using leverage. Responsible leveraged crypto trading requires discipline and a strong understanding of risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Understand Leverage Fully: Never use leverage you don’t understand. Know exactly how much exposure you are taking on and how it affects your liquidation price. Start Small: If you are new to leverage, begin with very low multiples (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand its mechanics and risks without risking significant capital. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain unfavorable level, limiting potential losses. Avoid Excessive Leverage: High leverage (like 40x) should generally be avoided unless you are an extremely experienced trader with a robust risk management strategy and capital you can afford to lose entirely. Monitor Liquidation Price: Always know your liquidation price and understand what market movement would trigger it. Manage Position Size: Even with leverage, ensure the amount of capital allocated to a single leveraged trade is a small percentage of your total trading portfolio. The Aftermath: What Remains of James Wynn’s Positions? Following the reported $73.34 million loss, James Wynn’s current holdings on Hyperliquid were valued at around $760,000. This figure likely represents the remaining value in his trading account after the significant losses were realized from the highly leveraged positions. It underscores the dramatic impact the loss had on his capital, wiping out the vast majority of the funds tied up in those specific trades. Summary The reported $73.34 million James Wynn loss on Hyperliquid serves as a dramatic illustration of the inherent risks in high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. Even for a seasoned trader like a Hyperliquid whale , aggressive positions, such as 40x leverage on Bitcoin and PEPE, can lead to catastrophic outcomes when the market moves unfavorably. This event underscores the critical importance of understanding and managing the amplified risks associated with leveraged crypto trading , particularly in volatile conditions that can lead to a rapid Bitcoin price drop or similar sharp moves in other assets. While leverage offers the potential for amplified gains, this case is a powerful reminder that it can just as quickly lead to devastating losses if not handled with extreme caution and robust risk management practices.

2025-05-31T15:44:25,"NYC Comptroller Slams Mayor Eric Adams' Bitcoin Bond Plan as 'Fiscally Irresponsible'","New York City’s Comptroller has dismissed a plan by Mayor Eric Adams to back municipal bonds with bitcoin BTC, calling it “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Comptroller Brad Lander, who co-manages the city’s debt issuance, rejected the proposal just days after Adams pitched the so-called “BitBond” to a crowd at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas. “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” Lander said in a press release . He added that such a move could shake investor confidence and run afoul of federal tax law. The idea is part of Adams’ broader push to position New York as a global crypto hub. Since taking office, he has converted paychecks into crypto and launched a digital asset advisory council. But Lander pushed back against the bond, which could use some of the proceeds to buy BTC.

2025-05-31T15:30:18,"Bitcoin Boost: Brazil’s Méliuz Plans $78.6M Share Offering for BTC Treasury","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Boost: Brazil’s Méliuz Plans $78.6M Share Offering for BTC Treasury Big news from Latin America! Brazilian fintech company Méliuz is making a bold move into the world of cryptocurrency. They’ve announced plans for a significant primary share offering, aiming to raise substantial capital specifically to bolster their Bitcoin holdings. This development highlights the growing trend of corporate adoption of digital assets, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil . Why is Méliuz Planning a Share Offering for Bitcoin? According to reports, Méliuz intends to raise up to 450 million reais, which translates to approximately $78.6 million based on current exchange rates. The primary stated purpose for this capital raise is to purchase additional Bitcoin for the company’s corporate BTC Treasury . This isn’t Méliuz’s first foray into the crypto space; they already hold 320.25 BTC, valued at around $33.55 million at the time of the announcement. Companies decide to add Bitcoin to their treasury for various reasons. Here are a few common motivations: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in economies experiencing currency devaluation. Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ appeals to companies looking for a long-term store of value outside traditional financial assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investors: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and attract investors interested in the crypto market. Future Potential: Belief in the long-term growth and adoption of decentralized technologies and cryptocurrencies. For Méliuz, a fintech operating in Brazil, the decision could be influenced by a combination of these factors, potentially including the economic landscape in Brazil and the increasing interest in crypto within the region. Understanding the Share Offering Mechanism A primary Share Offering , also known as a public offering or equity offering, is when a company sells new shares of its stock to the public for the first time (IPO) or sells additional new shares after it’s already public (secondary offering). In this case, it appears to be a secondary offering since Méliuz is already a publicly traded company. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Méliuz announces its intention to sell new shares. The company works with investment banks to price and market the shares. Investors (institutional and retail) purchase the new shares. The capital raised from the sale goes directly to Méliuz. Méliuz plans to use a significant portion of these funds to acquire more Bitcoin . This method allows Méliuz to raise a substantial amount of cash relatively quickly, leveraging investor interest in their company to fund their strategic decision to expand their BTC Treasury . What Does This Mean for Méliuz and Bitcoin? For Méliuz , this move could be seen as a strategic play to align the company with the burgeoning digital asset economy. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings, they are making a clear statement about their confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future value. This could potentially attract a new segment of investors who are bullish on both fintech and crypto. For Bitcoin , corporate treasury adoption from publicly traded companies, especially those outside the traditional tech or finance hubs, is a positive signal. It demonstrates increasing mainstream acceptance and utility beyond speculative trading. While $78.6 million might seem modest compared to Bitcoin’s overall market cap, it represents a significant commitment from a company like Méliuz and contributes to the overall demand for BTC. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the move is strategic, it’s not without potential challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant drop in BTC’s price could negatively impact Méliuz’s balance sheet and stock performance. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in countries like Brazil . Changes could affect the holding or use of Bitcoin. Execution Risk: Successfully completing a large Share Offering depends on market conditions and investor demand. Investor Perception: While some investors will be excited, others might be wary of the risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet. Méliuz will need to navigate these factors carefully as they proceed with the offering and subsequent Bitcoin purchases. The Growing Trend of Corporate BTC Treasury Holdings Méliuz joins a growing list of companies worldwide that have allocated a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have been vocal advocates and large-scale accumulators of BTC. Other companies, including Tesla (though they have also sold some holdings), Square (now Block, Inc.), and various smaller firms, have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend suggests a shift in how some corporations view treasury management and asset allocation in the digital age. Méliuz’s decision highlights that this trend is not confined to Silicon Valley or North America but is gaining traction globally, with companies in regions like Brazil recognizing the potential of Bitcoin . In Conclusion: A Bold Step for Méliuz and Brazil Méliuz’s plan to raise $78.6 million through a Share Offering primarily to boost its BTC Treasury is a significant development. It underscores the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin and the willingness of companies, particularly in dynamic markets like Brazil , to integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. While risks exist, the move signals Méliuz’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin ‘s long-term value and its potential role in corporate finance. It will be interesting to watch how this strategy unfolds and if other Brazilian or Latin American companies follow suit.

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports , Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority. “We shouldn’t be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It’s not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.” Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn’t convinced about it. “If there’s a war in the South China Sea, we’ve got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That’s not something we should be saying with a straight face.” Dimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/jpmorgan-s-jamie-dimon-says-u-s-should-stockpile-missiles-not-bitcoin,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET","Markets|United States|Bitcoin|Jamie Dimon|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T15:22:11,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC’s Chances Of A Drop To $100,000 Increase","Bitcoin (BTC) has faced considerable selling pressure after reaching its new all-time high on May 22. Buyers are showing signs of fatigue after multiple failed attempts to push the price towards $115,000, leading to a substantial increase in bearish sentiment around the flagship cryptocurrency. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,527. Meta Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to assess adding Bitcoin to the company’s treasury. The results, shared by PhoenixNews, showed that 8.9 million shares were abstentions, and nearly 205 million shares were broker non-votes. The proposal, submitted by investor Ethan Peck, asked Meta to evaluate if converting a portion of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin would be better to preserve shareholder value. Meta had $72 billion in cash, cash reserves, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024. The proposal claims these are being eroded by inflation and low returns and presents Bitcoin as a more reliable long-term store of value. The proposal also highlighted growing institutional interest in Bitcoin adoption, presenting Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy as an example. It also mentioned BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation and speculation about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves. However, Meta’s board of directors dismissed the proposal, calling it unnecessary. The board added that Meta has a robust treasury management process that prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support operations. The board of directors released a statement, stating, “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury.” Bitcoin Supply Shock Could Amplify Prices: Sygnum Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at digital asset banking group Sygnum, believes a Bitcoin supply shock could have significant price implications compared to previous cycles. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect, meaning every $1 of demand leads to, say, $20-30 additional market capitalization. We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETFs or around the US elections.” Tischhauser highlighted the limited supply of the flagship cryptocurrency relative to institutional capital on the demand side as a reason for a possible spike in the Bitcoin price over the next few months. “This liquid supply has been falling steadily over the past 1.5 years, not least because of the proliferation of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles such as Strategy, Twenty-One Capital, and others.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could dip to $100,000 over the next few days if bearish sentiment persists. However, on-chain data suggests prolonged trading below this level could be limited. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered substantial selling pressure this week as it struggled to build momentum after surging to a new all-time high on May 22. A CryptoQuant analysis showed the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which tracks profits and losses from Bitcoin transactions, indicated moderate profit-taking at current levels. Another metric supporting a quick rebound if BTC slips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, which sits at $96,000. If the price falls below $100,000, the $96,000 could act as a floor, attracting buyers and limiting downside. According to crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa, current market conditions are ideal for a price recovery in the coming days. “still not rushing into any positions personally. Lost some $ yesterday by overstaying my welcome and roundtripping w. that Trump tweet, is what it is. Overall, I still think it's a scalping environment. I do think $BTC bounces relatively soon, though.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action over the past two weeks. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping to an intraday low of $102,135 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, and BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week with a marginal increase but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,835. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged below the 20-day SMA and settled at $105,662 after a drop of over 2%.

2025-05-31T15:15:43,"Crypto market today: Cronos price as Dogwifhat, Livepeer plunge","The crypto market today, May 31, remained under pressure as concerns about trade and the historically weak performance in June continued. Bitcoin dropped to $103,000, while the market cap of all coins fell by double digits. Let’s explore some of the top movers in the cryptocurrency market today. Why the crypto market is falling today Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies continued its strong downward tend as concerns about trade rose. Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imported steel and aluminium. He said this at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he made the case for his approval of the Nippon and US Steel purchase. Details of that transaction are still thin, though the US is expected to maintain a golden share in the company. The statement came on the same day that he accused China of not living to its deal in Switzerland. Also, Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, warned that talks between the two countries had moved into a stalemate. These risks have led to a sense of fear among market participants, which explains why the stock market has also pulled back. The crypto market crashed as investors positioned themselves for June, a month that s historically bearish for Bitcoin and other altcoins. Read more: Crypto market crash: is this the end of the bull run? Cronos price jumped as ETF hopes rose The Cronos token hit a high of $0.1070 on Saturday, its highest level since April 2, and 57% above its lowest point this year. CRO price jumped after Canary filed for a spot CRO ETF with staking feature. This fund will give investors access to the staking fee that users get. The daily chart shows that the CRO price bottomed at $0.067 in March and then bounced back to a high of $0.1070 today. It has moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since February. Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% retracement level at $0.1500, which is about 40% above the current level. Livepeer price crashes Livepeer price chart | Source: TradingView LPT token surged to $14.23, its highest level since January 18, and up by 342% from its lowest level in April. It jumped sharply after it was listed by Upbit, the biggest crypto exchange in South Korea. Tokens often surge after being listed by Upbit and other major exchanges. These gains, however, are usually short-lived, which explains why the Livepeer price has dropped sharply on Saturday. Technicals suggest that the token has more downside to go, with the next price to watch being at $6.65. A move above the resistance at $14.23 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-05-31T15:10:21,"Strategy leads public firms in BTC acquisition during Q1 2025","Public companies purchased 95,431 BTC worth approximately $8.14B in Q1 2025 and were now raising billions to invest in more Bitcoin. Strategy led the list of corporate BTC accumulators, but more public companies followed the same playbook at smaller scales. A Bitwise report revealed that publicly traded companies held roughly 688K BTC by the end of March, representing a 16.1% quarter-on-quarter surge. Total corporate BTC holdings represented a 2.15% increase in total value from the previous quarter and 3.28% of the 21M BTC supply. The increase in holdings pushed the total value of Bitcoin held by public firms to approximately $56.7B, based on an average BTC price of $82,445. The report also revealed that 12 new companies added Bitcoin to their treasuries for the first time during Q1 2025, increasing the total number of publicly traded firms accumulating BTC to 79. Hong Kong-based Ming Shing was the largest new buyer. Its subsidiary, Lead Benefit, acquired 833 BTC in two separate purchases in January and February. Strategy leads public firms in BTC acquisition during Q1 2025 CryptoQuant data revealed that Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) added 81,785 BTC in Q1 2025, spending slightly above $8 billion. It also spent $1.4 billion to acquire 15,355 Bitcoin from April 21 to April 28, bringing its total holdings to 553,555 BTC worth over $52 billion based on BTC’s price of over $95K at the time. Strategy bought 1,895 more BTC during the week of April 28 to May 4, 2025, at an average price of $95,167, bringing its total holdings to 555,450 BTCs valued at around $57.7 billion based on BTC price at the time. Rumble made headlines with a 188 BTC buy in March, while another unexpected entrant, HK Asia Holdings Limited, bought just one Bitcoin in February, which doubled its share price in a single trading day. Japan’s Metaplanet also disclosed on April 14 that it had purchased an additional 319 BTC at an average price of about $82,770, bringing its total holdings to 4,525 BTC valued at around $383.2 million. Metaplanet’s $406 million BTC investment positioned it among the top corporate holders globally — currently ranked tenth, just behind Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. According to Arkham data, cryptoQuant data also showed that Tether added 8,888 BTC to its reserves in Q1 2025, pushing its holdings to over 100,000 BTC. Other notable companies that bought Bitcoin include the Blockchain Company, which added 605 BTC to its balance sheet, and Semler Scientific, which bought 1,108 BTC. $660 billion Susquehanna bought nearly $300 million more Bitcoin in Q1 and now owns $1.3 billion worth of BTC.

The Bitcoin mining firm already held 48,237 BTC as of April 30th. Additionally, GameStop also plans to raise $1.3 billion via a 0.00% convertible note maturing in 2030. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen considered Bitcoin a tool for hedging against currency depreciation, adding that its growth potential could be even greater than expected. Meanwhile, the company is holding $1.5 billion in newly raised funds under the codename Project Rocket to invest in Bitcoin, adding to its $4.75 billion cash reserves. Brazilian public company Meliuz filed to raise $26.45 million to buy Bitcoin, while Sharplink Gaming is set to raise $1 billion to buy BTC. French company The Blockchain Group is also gearing up to raise €12.1 million to buy more Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Econometrics also observed that public companies were starting to outpace ETFs in Bitcoin accumulation. According to his analysis, these companies added more BTC to their balance sheets than the spot ETFs over the past three quarters (including Q1 2025).

At the event, the crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Bilal bin Saqib mentioned that the country had launched a Bitcoin wallet and has committed significant energy resources to support the digital asset industry. “Our youth are online and on-chain. Pakistan, with over 40 million crypto wallets and an average age of 23 years, is now being recognized for its future rather than its past,” Bilal bin Saqib said at the event. IMF raises concerns over Pakistan’s latest move During the launch, Saqib mentioned that the development is expected to open doors to several entities, including autonomous miners, technology firms, and blockchain companies to invest in Pakistan. However, the IMF frowned at the announcement, with the body seeking clarification from the Finance Minister over the legality of the move and the electricity allocation, even in the face of constant energy shortages and fiscal constraints. According to sources inside the Finance Ministry, the decision was taken without consulting the IMF and has raised questions over the legal status of digital assets in Pakistan. The government has yet to respond to the IMF’s concerns about electricity tariffs and resource distribution. The IMF representative also declined to comment when asked to. However, the source said that the body has mentioned that all policy steps under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) must be carried out in consultation with it. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations said. “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks.” The IMF delegation, currently locked in virtual talks with Pakistani officials, is expected to hold a private session to discuss the government’s plan to provide electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. Formation of new digital asset authority underway The new policy decision is part of a bigger government strategy to include digital assets in the country’s economy. An important aspect of this plan is the creation of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), as approved by the Finance Ministry. The body will be tasked with regulating crypto exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It will also be in charge of the tokenization of national assets and debt, aligning the country’s crypto policies with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). During the event, Bilal bin Saqib also urged global investors to join Pakistan’s digital shift, urging them to come and invest in the country’s growing ecosystem. “The PDAA is a critical step in protecting global investors and formalizing Pakistan’s role in the digital economy,” Bilal bin Saqib noted. The event was attended by prominent figures, including United States Vice President JD Vance and Eric and Donald Trump Jr., the sons of United States President Donald Trump. Pakistan began to shift its previous stance on digital assets earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. The body was tasked with drawing up a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and attracting foreign investments into the country’s crypto ecosystem. Among the early proposals of the council was the use of surplus energy for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data center operations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-31T14:30:39,"Is Bitcoin Price Doomed For $93K? Technical Indicators Paint A Bearish Image","The Bitcoin price has not quite been able to maintain the bullish momentum that saw it climb to a new all-time high last week. Instead, the premier cryptocurrency has succumbed to bearish pressure over the past few days, falling about 7% from its record-high price. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin price seems to be at the start of what could be a disappointing downward run over the coming weeks. The latest technical price data indicate a potential bearish trend reversal for the price of BTC, with the market leader at risk of losing its six-figure valuation. Which Technical Indicators Are Sounding The Sell Alarm? In a May 30 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci provided a technical insight into the price of Bitcoin, explaining that signs are quickly turning bearish for the flagship cryptocurrency. The online pundit projected that BTC could face a severe price downturn to around the $93,000 level in the near future. Related Reading: Halfway To Clean: Bitcoin Hits 50% Renewable Mark, Ripple Chairman Reacts Kesmeci highlighted changes in some technical indicators on the daily timeframe, suggesting that a correction might be on the horizon for the Bitcoin price. One of these indicators is the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that estimates the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price movements. As observed in the chart above, the daily RSI is around 51 points and below the 14-day simple moving average (SMA). According to the crypto analyst, this technical indicator shift points to a weakening bullish momentum for the Bitcoin price. Kesmeci also noted that the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP), which analyzes trading volume around a price region, signals a heavy trading zone around the $103,500 level. A sustained close beneath this level could lead to elevated selling pressure for the flagship cryptocurrency, the analyst said. Furthermore, Kesmeci mentioned that the AlphaTrend indicates that a second close below 106.269 may trigger a “sell” signal for the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) suggests that the bears are gaining the upper hand in the market. Finally, Kesmeci pinpointed the next target at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level and the FRVP Value Area Low (VAL), both of which could be considered major support zones, at around $93,000 and $91,800, respectively. Ultimately, all these technical levels suggest that the Bitcoin price may correct to the $91,000 – $93,000 bracket. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $104,000 mark, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-31T14:20:37,"Texas Bitcoin reserve bill heads for governor's desk for approval","Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) Bill SB21 has scaled the legislative hurdle after the state Senate adopted the Conference Committee report. The support was overwhelming, with a majority of 24 – 7 voting to adopt the report. With this move, the bill has finally scaled the legislative process and is heading to the Governor’s desk for evaluation. According to Bitcoin Laws , adopting the Conference Committee report meant that the Senate agreed with all the changes to the bill. The House initially approved the report on May 30, with 110 members for it and only 25 against it. This approval finalizes the long legislative process for SB21, which was further extended due to amendments to the bill. With the House and Senate having different versions, the two chambers formed the Conference Committee to agree on these amendments. Some of the amendments that the Conference Committee kept include the House amendment, which increased the market cap for eligible reserve assets to at least $500 billion market cap for the last 24 months. However, it removed the provision that allows the comptroller to stake reserve assets. If passed, the bill would allow the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, the state’s chief financial officer, to create a crypto reserve using part of the state investment funds. It also establishes a five-member advisory committee that will set the investment policies and requires the comptroller to publish financial status reports every two years. Texas to join New Hampshire as states with Bitcoin reserves Many believe Governor Greg Abbot will pass the bill, allowing Texas to join New Hampshire and Arizona as US states with an SBR law. Abbot has shown public support for the bill by sharing an article praising the legislative efforts on X. The bill also benefits Texas by making it the crypto capital of the US. The state is already the biggest for Bitcoin mining in the US, with the state responsible for most of the US Bitcoin mining hash rate. Thus, creating an SBR will only boost its crypto credentials. The state has the second-biggest economy in the US, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.7 trillion, only behind California and ahead of New York. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis , its economy is growing faster than that of the US. While Texas could become the third state with an SBR law, it is set to be the second state to commit part of its portfolio to invest in crypto assets to hedge against inflation. New Hampshire already has the honor of being the first state to have an SBR law that enables the state treasurer to invest in crypto assets. However, the Arizona SBR law does not allow the investment of state funds into crypto assets. Instead, the enacted crypto reserve bill HB 2749 only permits the creation of a crypto reserve to be funded using unclaimed crypto assets, airdrops, and staking rewards. The Arizona SBR law represents a compromise after the state governor, Katie Hobbs, vetoed two other SBR bills requiring the state to invest, noting that the “current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars.” 30 State SBR bills currently under consideration in the US Meanwhile, more states still have SBR bills in the works, with the majority in the committee stage showing massive interest in Bitcoin reserves. States such as North Carolina, Alabama, Montana, Georgia, and Iowa have their SBR bills in different stages. However, it is not just SBRs that are gaining interest. Pro-crypto legislative efforts have generally increased, with Michigan recently introducing four new bills related to Bitcoin and other crypto assets. One of the bills could allow investment of some of state retirement funds into cryptocurrencies. There is another bill to ban the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while proposed legislation seeks to allow Bitcoin mining projects on abandoned oil and gas wells, with tax deductions for the mining programs. The state has a total of seven pro-Bitcoin bills under consideration and recently declared May 13, 2025, as Digital Awareness Day through House Resolution 100. The resolution stated that the designation will encourage activities and programs that enable a better understanding of digital assets and their impacts.

This means that investors should not expect any protection or guidance regarding their tokens like TRUMP. “There is a lot of interest in memecoins, but people should know this: You should not expect SEC protection in these assets,” Peirce said in an interview with CNBC. This statement came at the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas. The SEC said in February that most memecoins were not considered securities under U.S. federal law, leaving the agency ungoverned by assets such as the TRUMP token, which was launched weeks after Trump was reinstated as president. Peirce likened this process to NFTs, which became popular in 2021, and argued that the SEC should announce its inactivity with a clear public statement on this issue, as it did at that time. Related News: Massive Altcoin Whale Misses Out on $42.64 Million in Profits - Bought High, Sold Low, Here Are the Trades It Made On the other hand, since President Trump took office, the SEC has taken a softer, more industry-friendly approach towards the cryptocurrency industry, but this strategy has raised conflict of interest allegations as the Trump family has become increasingly involved in crypto. The Trump Organization and its affiliates control 80% of the TRUMP token. The token skyrocketed in January after Trump made statements on social media, reaching a market value of $15 billion. However, it soon lost a significant amount of value. Still, project developers continue to make money thanks to the fees charged per transaction. The White House maintains that there is no conflict of interest by saying Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children, but figures such as Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal have warned that such assets could be a “back door” for foreign or corporate interests to access the president. SEC Member Peirce said the agency’s decisions were not politically motivated: “We didn’t have clear rules. There were a lot of questions about how crypto activities intersect with securities laws. Now we want to take a step back and write clear rules.” *This is not investment advice.

This move has cleared the final legislative hurdle for the state’s proposed Bitcoin reserve fund. With both chambers adopting the measure, the legislation advances to Governor Greg Abbott for final approval and signature into law. During floor proceedings, Senator Schwertner declared the motion’s success and underlined that the law creates the Texas Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve as a specialized fund that would be administered by the state Comptroller of Public Accounts.

This includes authorization for the Comptroller to engage qualified liquidity providers and expand the fund’s financial capabilities. Legislative negotiators made major modifications to the original proposal during conference committee discussions. A key revision extends the duration requirement for eligible cryptocurrencies from 12 months to 24 months. This means altcoins must maintain a minimum market capitalization of $500 billion for two full years before qualifying for inclusion in the reserve. Members of the conference committee declined to allow the Comptroller to use reserve assets for lending or staking. In addition, they removed clauses that would have allowed voluntary cryptocurrency contributions to the fund. The legislation positions Texas to become the third state to establish an official Bitcoin reserve. This is following pioneering efforts by New Hampshire and Arizona. The development shows a growing trend among state governments exploring cryptocurrency as a tool for financial diversification and economic resilience. New Hampshire’s framework served as a reference point for Texas legislators, particularly regarding the methodology for evaluating and incorporating additional digital assets beyond Bitcoin i nto state reserves. The $500 billion market capitalization threshold represents one of the most stringent requirements among state-level cryptocurrency initiatives. With a number of mining operations and blockchain startups establishing significant presences within state borders, Texas has established itself as a leader in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The sports betting platform, on May 30, filed an S-3 ASR form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, officially declaring its intent to issue securities worth a staggering $1 billion. SharpLink disclosed that the purpose of the fundraiser is to purchase more Ethereum for its reserve.A Saylor Strategy, but for Ethereum Notably, Bitcoin is slowly becoming a part of the balance sheet of a growing number of institutions globally, thanks to Michael Saylor’s successful Bitcoin strategy, applied at MicroStrategy . Meanwhile, SharpLink appears to be copying the playbook, as most have, but for the altcoin leader, Ethereum. Initially, on May 27, the iGaming firm announced it has created an Ethereum-based treasury, nominating Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors. For the uninitiated, Lubin is an Ethereum co-founder and the CEO of Consensys, an Ethereum-focused software production studio.The announcement followed a $425 million securities purchase agreement, under which it offered its common stock at $6.15 per share to investors. Consensys led the funding round, with other notable investors including Pantera Capital, Digital Galaxy, and Ondo.Three days later, SharpLink plans to raise another $1 billion to fund its Ethereum treasury. Friday's S-3 ASR filing with the US SEC indicates that the firm intends to raise the cash by offering its common stock to qualified investors at $79.21 per share.The Nasdaq-listed public firm would use proceeds from the offering largely to buy Ethereum. Meanwhile, the leftover funds will cover other expenses, such as general operating costs.“Lubin Pulls a MicroStrategy for ETH”Meanwhile, the announcement has sparked positive sentiments within the Ethereum community, as optimism of a bullish momentum intensifies. Among others, market enthusiasts also expressed excitement that Ethereum may have found its own Saylor and Strategy.Eric Conner, an Ethereum and AI enthusiast, stated that Lubin “just pulled a MicroStrategy for ETH.” He expressed confidence that the deal would spell more demand for Ethereum, noting that the Saylor playbook now runs on Ethereum. https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1927380671334404511Other reactions also followed the thought pattern, with another user, OxBoboShanti, mentioning that Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.Remarkably, corporate firms are beginning to look beyond Bitcoin and have increasingly allocated to altcoins too. BTCS announced it would purchase $57.8 million worth of Ethereum earlier this month, while Nasdaq-listed Digital Commodity Capital Corporation revealed that it holds 103,000 XRP in its treasury.SharpLink’s Stock SoarsInterestingly, SharpLink offered its stocks on May 27 at $6.15; three days later, it is now offering them at $79.21. This is a testament to the stock’s price explosion following its announcement of a strategic Ethereum reserve.Its stock, under the ticker SBET, has surged 1,822% in the past five days, rallying from $3.99 to $76.70 at the time of writing.

2025-05-31T14:00:27,"Bitcoin Dominance May Have Hit Its Cycle High – What Comes Next For Alts?","Bitcoin is under renewed selling pressure after days of consolidating just below its $112,000 all-time high. The market, rattled by macroeconomic uncertainty and rising volatility, has forced BTC into a cooling phase around the $103K–$106K range. While bulls are still in control of the broader trend, the current pullback reflects growing caution among investors amid global financial headwinds. One of the key factors shaping sentiment is the rise in US Treasury yields, which continues to signal systemic stress and tighter liquidity. These conditions have historically created a mixed environment for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, often triggering temporary corrections before the next impulse move. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a compelling take, suggesting that Bitcoin dominance may have already peaked for this cycle. If true, this could mark the beginning of capital rotation into altcoins — a signal that altseason might be around the corner. With Ethereum and other top assets holding key levels, the market could be entering a transition phase. BTC may stabilize in the short term, but all eyes are now on whether altcoins begin to outperform and shift momentum across the broader crypto space. Bitcoin Dominance In Question Amid Global Tensions Bitcoin is facing a critical moment after retracing more than 7% from its recent all-time high of $112,000. As the price consolidates around the $103,000–$105,000 range, traders and analysts are watching closely to see whether this is a healthy pullback or the beginning of a broader shift in market structure. The retracement comes amid rising macroeconomic tensions, with the ongoing US–China tariff standoff introducing a new wave of uncertainty that’s rippling through global markets. Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin has been the undisputed leader of this cycle. Since its breakout in 2021, BTC has consistently outperformed the broader crypto market, showing resilience in the face of economic volatility and systemic financial risk. Altcoins, on the other hand, have struggled to regain their 2021 highs, with many still down significantly from their previous peaks. However, not everyone believes Bitcoin will continue to dominate. Pillows recently suggested that BTC dominance has likely peaked for this cycle. While he cautions that “nothing goes down in a straight line,” a falling BTC dominance is historically one of the strongest signals for the beginning of an altseason. If this trend holds, it could mark a turning point for altcoins to reclaim market share and outperform in the coming months. Still, the transition won’t be immediate. Dominance trends can take time to develop, and Bitcoin’s price action remains the key driver of overall market direction. For now, Bitcoin is testing support, and the broader market is holding its breath, watching closely for signs of a new phase in this bull cycle. BTC Price Analysis: Approaching Make-or-Break Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $103,764, hovering just above the key support level at $103,600. The 4-hour chart shows clear downward momentum after BTC failed to break through the $112K all-time high last week. Since then, price has declined steadily, with lower highs and lower lows forming a short-term bearish structure. BTC is now testing the confluence of the horizontal support at $103,600 and the 200-period simple moving average (SMA), currently positioned around $102,600. This zone is critical for bulls to defend. A sustained break below it could open the door to deeper retracements, possibly toward the $100K psychological level or even the $98K–$99K region. On the other hand, holding this support could lead to a rebound. Short-term moving averages (34 EMA and 50 SMA) have started to curl down, suggesting pressure remains, but oversold conditions could attract dip buyers if volume picks up. For now, Bitcoin’s bullish structure is intact on higher timeframes, but the short-term trend hinges on the defense of this demand zone. The coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether BTC stabilizes for another leg up or breaks down to search for lower support.

2025-05-31T13:40:15,"Brazil's Méliuz offers stocks to add more Bitcoin to treasury","Brazilian firm Méliuz has announced a share offering to fund the purchase of additional Bitcoin for its treasury. According to the firm, it plans to raise 450 million reais (about $78 million) to purchase the leading digital asset, a move that has caused its shares to tumble over 8%. Méliuz, which trades in the cashback and coupon business, trades on the B3 exchange in Brazil under the ticker CASH3. The company initially plans to offer about 17 million common shares to raise around 150 million reais (approximately $26.2 million). The company also left enough space to expand the offering by up to 200%, which could see it triple the amount if demand goes as planned. Méliuz embraces Bitcoin amid its transformation The latest announcement marks a new chapter in the company’s transformation, moving from a traditional fintech to what can be described as the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil. Since March, when the company made a $4.13 million Bitcoin purchase, Méliuz has accumulated around 320.2 BTC, currently worth $33.55 million. It also became one of the first fintech companies in Brazil to offer crypto exposure to its clients, with this new step a way to increase its involvement in the industry. “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share,” the company said in a previous statement about its strategy shift. Markets appear to have priced in the news, with the company’s stock swinging wildly over the past year. The stock is up 217% since the beginning of 2025 at around 2.53 reais per share, climbing to a high of around 11 reais. The recent drop saw the price hit 8.13 reais, with trading volume hitting 6.51 million shares. According to Ray Nasser, the head of the Latin America branch of trading firm BlockFills, Méliuz has been adopting the same strategy as Michael Saylor-owned Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). He mentioned that the move has been able to help its shareholders get better value for their money. “The company lost its relevance over the years, and its stock price went down,” he said. “Although it made a turnaround in 2024, it’s doing what Strategy is doing now, it’s riding the hype.” Comparison to Strategy and Bitcoin adoption The firm has earned the compliment of being compared to United States firm, Strategy over the last few years. Strategy kickstarted the big-scale Bitcoin adoption in the United States, with the firm now holding about 580,250 Bitcoins, worth over $60 billion, using several capital raises. During the bull run, the company’s stock outperformed Bitcoin itself, creating what some analysts called a “Bitcoin proxy” for investors. But Méliuz carries out its operation differently, with the company’s market cap hovering around 305 million reais ($53.8 million), a fraction of its 9 billion reais peak after it went public in 2020. Meanwhile, the company has set its pricing for June 12, with trading of the new shares beginning on June 16. The company has scheduled two priority subscription periods for existing shareholders, with the first expected to start on June 4 after a June 3 cutoff date, and the second expected to end on June 10, after a June 9 cutoff date, allowing them to own the new shares first. The company was founded in 2011 and has built its business on cashback rewards and discount coupons, partnering with over 1,000 brands and accumulating 35 million registered users. Méliuz started offering Bitcoin exposure to clients back in 2022 when PayPal and other companies showed positive results experimenting with crypto purchases.

Volume profile depicts that there is a heavy interest around $103K, and the breakdown below this level will signal a deeper move towards the $102K zone. Bears are pressing the market lower, and the $103K zone remains a critical short-term support. However, if BTC surges past $104.8K would be the first sign for bulls to regain momentum. Big whales flip to selling mode Bitcoin price dropped by more than 5% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,528 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume dipped by 20% to stand at $50.73 billion. On-chain data reveals that while open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April and options have skyrocketed 126%. Big players like whales holding over 10,000 BTC have quietly flipped from accumulation to net selling. This has pushed coins back onto exchanges in a classic profit-taking scenario. Bitcoin-linked ETFs depict the position. May 30 saw a total net outflow of $616 million from US BTC ETFs, with none of the twelve ETFs recording a net inflow. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs posted a net inflow of over $70 million, hitting 10 consecutive days of inflows. The Fear and Greed index has turned back to the “Neutral” zone after flashing greed for a couple of weeks. With Ether and XRP down by nearly 4%, and Solana off by 6%, traders are now watching for a potential reversal or bracing for more turbulence.

2025-05-31T13:15:46,"Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs","The post Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s safe to say most of us did not see this coming! Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , briefly climbed higher than Bill Gates on the global wealth chart. But as quickly as it happened, a Bitcoin price drop pulled Nakamoto back down. Still, the moment sparked a fresh wave of interest in crypto’s most famous ghost and the fortune they’re quietly sitting on. Bitcoin Rally Pushed Nakamoto Ahead of Gates Nakamoto’s wallet, believed to hold 1.1 million BTC – around 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply – recently reached a massive $113.8 billion , according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham . That briefly put him ahead of Bill Gates , whose fortune stood at $112.9 billion , based on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires list . It was enough to make Nakamoto the 12th richest person in the world , if only for a moment. The surge was driven by optimism around a potential U.S.–China trade deal , which helped push Bitcoin’s price higher. But the Lead Didn’t Last Long The crypto market, as always, had other plans. Bitcoin’s price slipped again, bringing Nakamoto’s estimated net worth back to around $114 billion as of May 31, 2025 . Meanwhile, Gates’ net worth has risen to $166.3 billion , putting a wide gap back between the two. Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, Anyway? Nakamoto’s true identity remains one of crypto’s biggest unanswered questions. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, people have speculated that it could be Nick Szabo , Len Sassaman , or Peter Todd . In 2024, a documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery pointed the finger at Peter Todd but he quickly denied any connection. That only added to the legend of Satoshi: a billionaire who might not even know they’re currently one of the wealthiest people alive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation , Could Nakamoto Catch Up to Elon Musk? Topping Elon Musk , who currently has a net worth of $422.7 billion , would be a much bigger jump. For Nakamoto to match Musk, Bitcoin would need to skyrocket to $406,000 per coin. It sounds far-fetched, but in crypto, strange things happen all the time and this recent Gates moment proved that anything’s possible. Crypto’s Wealth Race: Who’s Next? This back-and-forth between Nakamoto and Gates shows just how unpredictable crypto can be. If Bitcoin rallies again, Nakamoto could easily reclaim the edge especially with Gates’ wealth holding steady. As the market keeps moving, the crypto world is watching closely – because in this game, one price spike could change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T13:15:00,"Ethereum price declines with June’s poor track record looming","Ethereum price pulled back in the past three days as traders adjust their positions for June, its historically worst month. Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined for three consecutive days, hitting a low of $2,500. That’s a 9.8% drop from its monthly high. Despite the pullback, it has outperformed most altcoins, many of which have fallen more than 15% from their highs this month. ETH retreated ahead of June, which is usually its worst month, because of the start of summer. CoinGlass data shows that the average monthly performance in June since 2016 is minus 7.4%. Its median monthly return in June is minus 8.68%. ETH monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass June is also Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) second-worst-performing month after September, with an average return of minus 0.35%. Seasonality does not always work out. For example, ETH dropped by 18% in March, bucking a four-year trend of gains. It also dropped by 31% in February, after recording positive gains in the last six consecutive years.

2025-05-31T13:05:37,"Trader Says Bitcoin Could Crash by Double-Digit Percentage Points After Confirming Downtrend – Here Are His Targets","Analyst and trader Justin Bennett believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) has further room to fall after the crypto king broke down. Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has a “confirmed break” after falling below a support level at around $106,000. According to Bennett, Bitcoin could fall by up to around 13% from the current level to a price of about $91,790 if BTC loses support levels that are around $100,730 and then $97,762. “Those downside targets are in play as long as $106,000 holds as new resistance on the daily time frame.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst and trader further says that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum ( ETH ), could turn bearish as USDT dominance, the percentage of USDT’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, rises. “This is the same Tether dominance outlook as eight days ago, and now we have a confirmed breakout. There are no guarantees, but you have to respect what’s on the chart, not what you hope will happen. If it holds, BTC and ETH pull back. Keep it simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Turning to Ethereum, Bennett says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is leaning bearish after breaking below an ascending trendline on the four-hour chart. “A little speculative right now, but I’d be willing to bet that ETH breaking this trend line opens up $2,460 and $2,360. Today’s fakeout above range highs gives Ethereum a bearish tilt. That said, markets could chop around while some of these supports hold.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,365 at time of writing, while Ethereum is trading at $2,605.

2025-05-31T12:51:49,"Bitcoin’s Path to $300K Could Face Geopolitical Risks, While Emotional Trading Add Uncertainty","Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally to an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22nd has ushered in a wave of heightened investor expectations. The surge, catalyzed by a sudden bullish breakout following the White House’s decision to delay 50% tariffs on EU goods, has since been tempered by geopolitical uncertainty and clear signs of market overexuberance. Social Chatter on Bitcoin Santiment’s data shows a sharp uptick in crowd optimism precisely as Bitcoin peaked, which led to an immediate correction. This is a reminder that extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks. Positive sentiment across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram hit its highest point this year on May 22, only to be swiftly reversed when President Trump’s tariff threat caused market jitters. Although the federal court ruling on May 28 deemed the “Liberation Day” tariffs unconstitutional, offering temporary relief, Santiment warned that recurring tariff-related discussions are now a key driver of volatility. Mentions of “tariff” and “trade war” spiked on social media in the final days of May, mirroring patterns observed during the April correction. Despite the cooling, the crowd remains bullish. The most popular Bitcoin options call is now for $300K. This sentiment depicted rising long-term expectations despite near-term instability. Santiment’s report also explained the reliability of crowd sentiment as a counter-indicator, with extreme fear on May 25 coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound to $106K. Meanwhile, blockchain fundamentals continue to show strength. Over 147,000 BTC have exited exchanges in 2025, which reduced immediate sell pressure and suggested continued confidence among holders. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has declined steadily since mid-April, indicating that older coins are being reactivated. Such a trend is typically a bullish signal associated with ongoing price expansions. Santiment noted that these shifts suggest the rally is driven not solely by speculative frenzy. BTC’s Path Ahead BTC whales continue to shape market tops. On the day of Bitcoin’s ATH, there were 18,782 transactions of over $100,000. Interestingly, this was the highest since Trump’s inauguration in January, suggesting significant profit-taking by institutional players. In fact, one whale held a 40x leveraged position now worth $1.2 billion. As such, the report warns that a liquidation event below $104,810 could trigger a cascade of long positions unwinding. As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, data shows that emotional extremes and external shocks continue to dictate short-term moves, even as exchange flows and coin age metrics point toward deeper bullish foundations. The road to $300K may be steep, but investor expectations, like Bitcoin’s price, have never been higher.
