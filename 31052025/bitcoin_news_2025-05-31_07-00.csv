2025-05-31T04:00:13,"Panama Canal Could Prioritize Bitcoin-Paying Ships, Mayor Suggests","Panama City’s mayor, Mayer Mizrachi, put forward an unusual plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29. He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ A Push For City-Level Crypto Mizrachi has also backed letting people pay city fees—taxes, fines and permits—in Bitcoin, Ether and USDC. He raised the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which produces over half of the nation’s GDP. He noted he wouldn’t need more laws to start one. But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

2025-05-31T03:57:58,"Best crypto presales to buy as Bitcoin sees renewed volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slipped 2.5% and 5%, respectively, on Saturday after President Donald Trump accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, reigniting fears of escalating trade tensions. The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

2025-05-31T03:30:40,"Wave Structure Puts XRP Price In The $18.22-$23.20 Range In The Short Term","The XRP price may be on the verge of a huge breakout, as a new wave structure points to a potential surge toward the $18.22 to $23.20 price range in the short term. This distinct wave structure has emerged on the weekly chart, echoing historical patterns and well-defined technical frameworks that preceded a significant rally in late 2024. Massive XRP Price Rally Incoming At the core of this short-term price analysis published by crypto analyst Dark Defender on X (formerly Twitter) is the appearance of a unique Elliott Wave structure now visible on the XRP weekly chart. According to the analyst’s forecast, XRP is set to complete its first two waves and is getting ready to enter Wave 3 . Recently, XRP broke through a long-standing descending resistance line and is now approaching a key mid-level target around the $5.85 to $6.39 range within Wave 3. While reaching this bullish range is important for the altcoin to initiate its next leg up, the main focus is on the upper targets between $18.22 and $23.20. Dark Defender has boldly forecasted that XRP, currently trading at $2.18, could see a massive price surge to $23 by November 2025, which is the anticipated peak of Wave 5. A historical reference from November 2024 further reinforces this optimistic outlook. At the time, the crypto analyst notes that XRP displayed a clear technical wave configuration that led to a strong upward move. The same structure appears to be playing out once again, now with stronger technical signals and a decisive resistance break. Based on XRP’s projected bullish trajectory on the weekly chart, the altcoin is expected to make a minor correction toward the $2.1 – $1.92 range before launching into Wave 3. This next move could see XRP break past the mid-level target and peak around $11 by September. After reaching the Wave 3 top, a corrective Wave 4 is anticipated, potentially triggering a major breakdown to the $7 – $8 zone. Once this consolidation phase ends, XRP is likely to progress into the final bullish Wave 5 , aiming for the ambitious upside target between $18.22 and $23.20, which represents a rally from 735% to 963%. XRP MVRV Golden Cross Signals Big Move Ahead The broader market sentiment around XRP is shifting bullish, as experts predict a strong rally on the horizon. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, XRP has just printed a rare and potentially significant Golden Cross between its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The emergence of this Golden Cross pattern suggests that long-term sentiment may be aligning with a renewed wave of optimism. Building on this key indicator, Martinez has boldly predicted that this crossover could mark the beginning of the next major leg up for XRP .",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-short-run-to-in-18-23/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Ali Martinez|Altcoin|Consolidation Phase|Descending Resistance Line|Elliot Wave Theory|golden cross|Market Value to Realized Value|MVRV ratio|Simple Moving Average|SMA|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T03:00:51,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows","Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up? Likewise, Binance inflow data shows that certain investor groups are not eager to sell their BTC, possibly anticipating further gains.

2025-05-31T03:00:36,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Presale Momentum, ETH Upgrades, SOL & ADA Developments","With new data emerging and notable upgrades taking shape, several leading crypto assets are catching attention this week. Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

2025-05-31T00:50:09,"NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams’s “Bitbond” Proposal as Legally and Fiscally Flawed","Key Takeaways: New York City Comptroller Brad Lander firmly rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue Bitcoin-backed municipal bonds. Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

Lander also believes that “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” Mayor Adams talked about his Bitbond proposal on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, a speech that came a week after he hosted New York City’s inaugural crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion. At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

Despite stepping down, Musk acknowledged the opportunity to address government waste and insisted that the core mission of DOGE would continue. The initiative, since its inception, has been characterized by aggressive budget cuts, job reductions, and departmental shutdowns, inevitably stirring considerable controversy. This event serves as a potent symbol of the evolving dynamic between influential tech figures and government. As tech giants and their leaders wield increasing power and influence, their involvement in politics becomes more scrutinized, leading to what some are calling the ‘find out’ stage for Silicon Valley Politics .

2025-05-30T22:00:23,"Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Has Failed to Boost Network Use: JPMorgan","In a new report, analysts at JPMorgan revealed that Ethereum’s latest upgrade, Pectra, has not increased network activity, although it brought technical improvements and made Ethereum more attractive to large financial institutions. Nevertheless, the real use of the blockchain remains slow. Daily transactions and wallet activity have not increased, and retail interest is still low. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Brought Major Improvements After much anticipation, the Pectra upgrade launched on Ethereum earlier this month with notable improvements. It made staking easier , gave bigger rewards, and made deposits and withdrawals faster. Ethereum’s market cap and price also increased significantly. The Pectra upgrade also added new standards like ERC-3643 and ERC-1400. These features were designed to help comply with financial laws such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). These changes aim to help Ethereum work better with traditional finance. The support from Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a major U.S. financial group, shows Ethereum’s growing role in regulated financial markets. Ethereum Focuses on Institutions Over Everyday Users JPMorgan believes Ethereum is following a path similar to Bitcoin by targeting large investors rather than individual users. While other blockchains focus on memecoins and retail trading, Ethereum is trying to attract serious companies and financial players. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), more institutional investors are betting on Ethereum’s future. Long positions in Ethereum’s future have gone up sharply. However, spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have only seen small investments compared to Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs gained massive inflows after President Donald Trump won the election in November 2024. Ethereum Network Activity Still Low Despite these growing institutional interests, Ethereum’s on-chain activity has not improved. Reportedly, daily transactions and active wallets on the network remain low. Likewise, Gas fees have plummeted. While reduced gas fees benefit users, they also suggest weaker demand. Notably, the rise of Layer 2 solutions helps lower costs and moves traffic off the leading Ethereum network. JPMorgan analysts also raised concerns over Ethereum’s circulating supply. Since the Dencun upgrade, more ETH has been released, raising fears that Ethereum might become inflationary again. Analysts at JPMorgan continue to carefully consider Ethereum’s future. In February, the bank said Ethereum will still face strong competition from other blockchains. On the other hand, Bitcoin is expected to stay ahead of Ethereum and other coins until at least 2025.

2025-05-30T21:50:13,"Trump Media Makes Strategic $2.32 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Move","BitcoinWorld Trump Media Makes Strategic $2.32 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Move In a development that has sent ripples through both the stock market and the cryptocurrency world, reports indicate that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has made a significant foray into the digital asset space. According to information shared by Watcher Guru on X, the company is set to make a massive Bitcoin acquisition, signaling a bold new direction for its treasury management strategy. What Does This $2.32 Billion Trump Media Bitcoin Deal Mean? The core of the news revolves around a reported agreement valued at an astonishing $2.32 billion . Under this deal, Trump Media is said to be purchasing Bitcoin with the explicit intention of holding it as a Treasury Asset . This move places DJT in a growing, albeit still small, group of publicly traded companies opting to allocate a portion of their corporate reserves into the leading cryptocurrency. For context, corporate treasury management traditionally involves holding low-risk, liquid assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or commercial paper. The decision to swap a substantial amount of capital for a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a significant departure from conventional practices. Key aspects of this reported deal include: Scale: The sheer size of the investment ($2.32 billion) is noteworthy, positioning it as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin acquisitions reported to date, potentially rivaling or exceeding holdings of other publicly known corporate holders depending on the exact terms and timing. Purpose: Holding Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset implies a long-term strategy, viewing BTC not just as a speculative trade but as a store of value or hedge against inflation, similar to how some view gold. Source: The report originated from Watcher Guru on X, a popular source for crypto news and market updates. While widely reported, official confirmation from Trump Media itself is the definitive next step that stakeholders will be watching for. Why Would Trump Media Consider a Crypto Investment Like Bitcoin? The decision for a company like Trump Media to engage in a large-scale Crypto Investment , specifically in Bitcoin, could be driven by several factors: Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant price appreciation over the long term, despite considerable volatility. A company might see this as an opportunity to grow its treasury reserves beyond the modest returns offered by traditional safe-haven assets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Bitcoin is often touted as ‘digital gold’ and a potential hedge against inflation dueating to its fixed supply cap (21 million coins). In an era of quantitative easing and potential currency devaluation concerns, holding a non-sovereign, scarce asset could be appealing. Attracting a Specific Investor Base: Trump Media’s platform, Truth Social, caters to a specific audience. Given the growing interest in cryptocurrency among various demographics, including those politically aligned, a move into Bitcoin could resonate with and potentially attract investors interested in both the company and the crypto space. Following Corporate Trends: While not mainstream, companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a potential blueprint for other corporations. This could signal confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability as a corporate asset. What are the Potential Challenges and Risks for DJT Stock and Bitcoin? While the potential upsides are clear, holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset comes with significant risks that could impact DJT Stock and the company’s financial stability: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. A significant downturn could rapidly diminish the value of Trump Media’s treasury holdings, potentially impacting its balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving and fragmented across different jurisdictions. Future regulations could impact the value, liquidity, or even the legality of holding Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. A security breach could result in the total loss of the invested capital. Accounting and Reporting Challenges: Accounting for volatile digital assets like Bitcoin can be complex and subject to specific rules (like FASB’s recent standard requiring fair-value accounting), which can introduce volatility into reported earnings. Public Perception: While appealing to some, a large Crypto Investment could alienate more conservative investors who prefer traditional, stable treasury management practices. How Does This Compare to Other Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? Trump Media’s reported $2.32 billion investment would place it among the top publicly traded companies by Bitcoin holdings. Here’s a simplified comparison (figures are approximate and subject to change based on market price and ongoing acquisitions): Company Approximate BTC Holdings (as of relevant reports) Reported Trump Media Holding MicroStrategy (MSTR) ~214,400 BTC ~ $2.32 Billion Worth of BTC (Exact amount depends on purchase price) Marathon Digital (MARA) ~17,857 BTC Tesla (TSLA) ~9,720 BTC Note: The actual number of Bitcoin acquired by Trump Media depends on the average purchase price paid during the reported $2.32 billion transaction. This table highlights the scale of the reported Trump Media deal. While MicroStrategy remains the leader by a significant margin in terms of the *number* of Bitcoin held, a $2.32 billion investment is substantial and indicates a serious commitment to the asset class. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors? For investors tracking DJT Stock , this news is crucial. It introduces a new variable – the performance of a volatile digital asset – directly onto the company’s balance sheet. Investors will need to consider: DJT Stock Volatility: The stock price may become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Due Diligence: Understanding Trump Media’s specific strategy for managing this asset (custody, risk management, future plans) is key. Market Sentiment: How the broader market reacts to a media company making such a large Crypto Investment could influence sentiment around DJT. For Bitcoin investors, a multi-billion dollar acquisition by a publicly traded company, regardless of its industry, is generally viewed positively as it signals increasing institutional adoption and demand. This could contribute to positive price momentum, though it does not guarantee future gains. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital Treasury Frontier The reported $2.32 billion Bitcoin acquisition by Trump Media marks a significant and potentially transformative moment for the company. By opting to hold Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset , DJT is embracing a strategy that, while still unconventional, is gaining traction among corporations seeking alternatives to traditional cash reserves. This move could offer substantial benefits if Bitcoin appreciates, potentially enhancing the company’s balance sheet and appealing to a digitally-savvy investor base. However, it also introduces considerable risk due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape. Investors in both DJT Stock and the broader cryptocurrency market will be watching closely to see how this strategic Crypto Investment unfolds and what impact it ultimately has on Trump Media’s financial future and the perception of corporate Bitcoin adoption.

2025-05-30T21:40:25,"Bitcoin: Chinese Think Tank Sees Opportunity Against US Dollar Dominance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Chinese Think Tank Sees Opportunity Against US Dollar Dominance In a move that has captured the attention of global financial and cryptocurrency markets, a Chinese government-affiliated think tank has reportedly evaluated Bitcoin , the leading digital asset, as a potential reserve asset and even a countermeasure against the long-standing dominance of the US Dollar in the global financial system. This perspective, emerging from within China, a nation known for its stringent stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies, is particularly noteworthy. According to information shared by Solid Intel on X, the think tank’s assessment suggests that Bitcoin “deserves continued attention” in the context of reserve assets, especially amidst ongoing concerns about the pervasive influence and potential risks associated with the US Dollar ‘s hegemony. Why Would a Chinese Think Tank Look at Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Understanding the significance of this perspective requires looking at the traditional role of reserve assets and the current global financial landscape. Traditionally, national central banks and governments hold reserve assets to provide economic stability, manage exchange rates, and ensure liquidity in times of crisis. Gold has historically served this purpose, and more recently, the US Dollar has become the preeminent global reserve currency, largely due to the size and stability of the U.S. economy, the depth of its financial markets, and the dollar’s role in international trade. However, the concentration of global finance around a single currency, the US Dollar , also creates dependencies and potential vulnerabilities for other nations. Discussions around ‘de-dollarization’ – efforts by countries to reduce their reliance on the dollar – have been gaining traction, particularly among nations seeking greater economic autonomy or those with geopolitical tensions with the United States. For a Chinese Think Tank , exploring alternatives or complements to the existing dollar-centric system is a strategic consideration. While China has been actively promoting its own currency, the Yuan, for international use and developing its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan, looking at independent, decentralized assets like Bitcoin , albeit cautiously, suggests an exploration of all potential avenues in a complex geopolitical and economic environment. Is Bitcoin Truly a Viable Countermeasure Against US Dollar Hegemony? This is where the think tank’s view becomes particularly intriguing and sparks considerable debate. The idea of Bitcoin challenging the US Dollar ‘s global status is a long-term, highly speculative prospect. The US Dollar ‘s dominance is deeply entrenched in global trade, debt markets, and institutional frameworks built over decades. However, Bitcoin possesses unique characteristics that proponents argue could, over time, offer an alternative: decentralization (no single country controls it), scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins), borderlessness, and censorship resistance. These traits stand in stark contrast to fiat currencies controlled by central banks. The think tank’s perspective likely isn’t suggesting an immediate replacement of the US Dollar with Bitcoin . Instead, it’s more probable they are evaluating Bitcoin as one piece in a broader strategy: As a Hedge: Holding a small portion of reserves in a non-sovereign, decentralized asset could potentially act as a hedge against risks specific to fiat currencies or the existing financial system. As an Alternative System Explorer: Investigating how a decentralized digital currency could function in international transactions or as a store of value outside traditional channels. As a Geopolitical Signal: Even the discussion from a state-affiliated body sends a signal about exploring options and acknowledging the evolving nature of global finance, potentially encouraging other nations or entities to consider alternatives to the US Dollar . It’s crucial to note the significant challenges Bitcoin faces before it could realistically challenge the US Dollar ‘s role, including its price volatility, scalability issues for mass transactions, regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions, and the sheer network effect and infrastructure supporting the dollar. China’s Complex Relationship with Digital Currency China’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been famously contradictory. On one hand, the country has implemented strict bans on crypto trading and mining, citing financial stability risks and speculative concerns. This has led many to believe China is outright against decentralized digital assets. On the other hand, China has been a pioneer in developing its own central bank digital currency , the Digital Yuan (e-CNY). This state-controlled digital currency is designed to replace physical cash, enhance domestic payments, and potentially facilitate international transactions under Beijing’s purview. The focus has clearly been on centralized digital money controlled by the state, not decentralized ones like Bitcoin . The fact that a government-affiliated Chinese Think Tank is discussing Bitcoin positively, even as a potential reserve asset or countermeasure, highlights a potential internal nuance or a strategic exploration happening behind the scenes. It suggests that while China suppresses public crypto activity, the strategic implications of decentralized digital assets are still being studied at higher levels, perhaps as a tool in geopolitical and economic strategy rather than a public investment vehicle. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Let’s break down the potential upsides and significant hurdles: Potential Benefits: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single government or central bank, offering potential independence from geopolitical influence. Scarcity: Fixed supply makes it potentially inflation-resistant over the long term, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed infinitely. Border-Agnostic: Can be sent and received globally without intermediaries, potentially useful for international transfers or bypassing traditional financial channels. Transparency (Pseudonymous): Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering a different type of transparency compared to traditional finance. Significant Challenges: Volatility: Extreme price swings make it a risky store of value for national reserves which prioritize stability. Regulatory Uncertainty: Lack of clear, consistent global regulations creates legal and operational risks for state adoption. Scalability: The network’s current capacity limits its use for high-frequency, large-volume transactions needed for global finance. Security & Custody: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin is complex and high-stakes for a nation-state. Energy Consumption: The energy used by the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism remains a point of criticism and environmental concern. Public Perception & Understanding: Still viewed with skepticism by many traditional finance experts and the general public. What Does This Signal for the Future of Digital Currency and Global Finance? This report from a Chinese Think Tank , while not official government policy, is a significant signal. It indicates that major global powers are seriously considering the implications of decentralized digital currency , even those like China that have been publicly restrictive towards it. It suggests that the conversation around global reserve assets and the future of finance is evolving beyond traditional fiat and gold. While Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar as the primary reserve asset is not on the immediate horizon, the fact that influential bodies are evaluating its potential role, even as a hedge or a component of a diversified reserve strategy, validates its growing importance on the global stage. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are not just speculative investments but are becoming intertwined with geopolitical and macroeconomic discussions. For investors and observers in the crypto space, this serves as a reminder that the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin extends beyond retail speculation to potential strategic adoption by sophisticated players, including nation-states or state-affiliated entities exploring alternatives in a shifting world order. Conclusion: A Noteworthy Shift in Perspective The evaluation of Bitcoin by a Chinese government-affiliated think tank as deserving attention for its potential role as a reserve asset and a countermeasure against US Dollar hegemony is a development of considerable interest. It highlights the strategic thinking occurring within major global powers regarding the future of finance and the role of decentralized digital currency . While China’s official stance on public crypto remains restrictive and its focus is heavily on the Digital Yuan, this report suggests a deeper, more nuanced internal analysis of Bitcoin ‘s potential utility in a geopolitical context. It underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin ‘s unique properties, even as significant challenges remain for its widespread adoption as a national reserve asset. This perspective from a Chinese Think Tank adds another layer to the ongoing global debate about de-dollarization, the future of reserve currencies, and the transformative potential of digital assets in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow. It’s a signal that the conversation around Bitcoin is moving from the fringes into the realm of high-level strategic consideration.

2025-05-30T21:34:02,"Metaplanet and K33 Deepen Bitcoin (BTC) Exposure With Strategic Initiatives","In a strategic move to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition goals, Japan-based Metaplanet issued $21 million in interest-free bonds to the Evo Fund on May 29, following a separate $50 million raise the previous day. These zero-coupon bonds, known as the 17th series, come with a $525,000 face value and are set to mature on November 28, 2025. As they bear no interest, Metaplanet avoids additional financial costs tied to borrowing. Metaplanet Adds to Bitcoin Warchest According to the official document , the terms allow Evo Fund to initiate early redemptions with a five-day notice, either in full or in multiples of $525,000. Additionally, redemptions may be linked to future funding rounds with the same investor. The bonds are unsecured, with no guarantees or administrators, which is in line with Japanese corporate law. Payment processing will take place at the company’s Tokyo office. This fundraising effort contributes to Metaplanet’s larger goal of amassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Year-to-date, the company has raised $135.2 million, including previous rounds in February ($25.9 million), March ($13.3 million), and earlier in May ($25 million). Currently holding approximately 7,800 BTC, worth around $840 million, Metaplanet ranks 11th among global corporate Bitcoin holders, with an average purchase price of $91,340 per BTC. In March, it used cash-secured put options to acquire 696 BTC, followed by an additional 145 BTC in April for $13.6 million. Metaplanet isn’t the only company doubling down on Bitcoin. In Scandinavia, K33 is taking a similar approach. K33 Joins Corporate Bitcoin Trend K33, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, announced plans to begin holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising 60 million SEK ($6.22 million). As per the announcement on May 28th, the funding was secured via interest-free convertible loans and a new round of share and warrant issuances. The Norwegian firm confirmed that 100% of the funds will be used to buy Bitcoin, possibly acquiring up to 57 BTC at current prices. The firm secured 45 million SEK ($4.66 million) through loans maturing in June 2028, and 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) via equity and warrants. Investors converting their warrants before March 2026 will be granted additional free warrants, which would potentially allow K33 to raise a total of 75 million SEK ($7.77 million). In its Q1 financial update, CEO Bull Jenssen said K33 is partnering with other Nordic Bitcoin treasury firms and intends to leverage its holdings to create Bitcoin-based services, including collateralized lending.

This triggered a significant decline over the past week and now appears highly bearish amid the latest breakdown. Considered as one of the most recovered assets during the last buying phase, Fartcoin recorded a mind-blowing gain and reached its highest level of $1.6 for the first time in four months. While that brought a good return on investment within a short period, major holders booked profits, and the price slipped. That action led to a steady dump as Bitcoin loses traction this week, and the price dipped to a daily low of $1.08. There’s hope for a rebound daily as the trend remains in favour of the bulls in the short term. However, looking at the recent breakdown in the bullish structure on the 4-hour chart, the trading landscape appears to have changed in favour of bears. As we can see on the daily chart, they are currently in charge of the market. In fact, more dips may surface with no signs of interceptions. Technically, the bulls are currently off the market. If they return with a major push above the current monthly high, we can anticipate another rally to a new multi-month high. But for now, they are taking a break. FARTCOIN’s Key Levels to Watch Source : Tradingview A slight price recovery may bring a retest at the breakdown level of $1.2 before resuming selling. If the market pushes above this level, it may reclaim the $1.646 resistance with a potential break up to $2 and $2.74. The target support levels to watch in the latest dip are $0.95 and $0.645.

Just as advancements impact areas like cryptocurrency and blockchain, they are also changing everyday tools we rely on. A significant update is rolling out that puts Gemini , Google’s AI assistant, more prominently into your inbox, a change that reflects the pervasive nature of AI integration across platforms. What Are Gemini AI Email Summaries? Google is introducing email summary cards powered by Gemini directly at the top of your email threads in Gmail . Previously, users had the option to tap a button to get an AI summary of a long email conversation. While that manual option still exists, the key change now is that Gemini will automatically generate these summaries when it deems necessary, without requiring you to initiate the action. This new feature is designed to save you time by providing a quick overview of lengthy emails or threads. As new replies arrive, the summary is intended to update, keeping the synopsis current. It’s an evolution of the capabilities first seen when Gemini launched in the Gmail side panel last year, which included tools for drafting emails and suggesting responses. Potential Challenges with AI Summaries While the convenience of automatic Email Summaries is clear, the reliability of AI -generated content has been a subject of discussion. There have been instances where AI summaries have proven inaccurate or misleading. For example, when Apple implemented AI summaries for app notifications, reports indicated the feature made errors, particularly with news headlines. This led to Apple temporarily pausing the feature for news apps. Google’s own AI Overviews in Search have also faced scrutiny for occasionally providing incorrect or poor-quality information. This history highlights the importance of exercising caution and potentially cross-referencing information provided by automatic AI summaries, especially for critical communications. Managing Gemini’s Automatic Summaries in Gmail Recognizing user preferences, Google provides options for managing this new feature. The automatic summary cards are initially available for emails in English. Whether the feature is turned on by default depends on your region. For instance, in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, and Japan, Google’s ‘smart features’, which include these summaries, are turned off by default. Users in other regions may find them enabled automatically. Regardless of the default setting, users can choose to enable or disable the automatic Email Summaries feature. This can typically be done within the ‘Smart features’ section of your Gmail Settings. For those using Gmail through a workplace account, administrators also have the option to disable personalization settings for users via the Admin console, offering a layer of control at the organizational level. This update is a prime example of how quickly AI is being integrated into the software and services people use daily. Understanding these rapid technological shifts is valuable not just for managing your inbox, but for navigating the broader digital landscape that includes areas like cryptocurrency and other emerging tech fields. Events like Bitcoin World Sessions: AI highlight the growing intersection of these advanced technologies. Conclusion The introduction of automatic Gemini -powered Email Summaries in Gmail marks another step in the integration of AI into everyday digital tools. While offering potential benefits in terms of convenience and time-saving, it also underscores the ongoing need to be aware of the limitations and potential inaccuracies of AI technologies. Fortunately, Google has provided users with the ability to control this feature through settings, allowing individuals to decide if this automatic assistance fits their workflow.

The downturn began during late U.S. trading hours, following remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , which confirmed a stall in trade discussions with China. This development triggered a risk-off sentiment across global financial markets, spilling over into digital assets. As a result, major cryptocurrencies recorded significant price declines, with Bitcoin leading the sell-off. Bitcoin Slides as Trade Talks Stall Bitcoin, the market’s flagship cryptocurrency, fell by 2.78%, settling around $105,575.53. The decline came shortly after renewed concerns about the U.S.-China trade relationship.

2025-05-30T21:15:28,"Metaplanet’s $21M Bitcoin Bet Sparks Rush for the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now — Qubetics Surges Ahead as Cronos Stalls","What does it say when billion-dollar firms raise capital just to buy more Bitcoin? Japan’s Metaplanet just issued $21 million in zero-interest bonds to expand its Bitcoin holdings, now aiming for 10,000 BTC by 2025. With over 7,800 BTC already secured, Metaplanet has even surpassed El Salvador’s national reserve. This move isn’t just symbolic; it signals that digital assets are being institutionalized, reshaping how the market perceives long-term value in blockchain. The confidence is growing, and the clock is ticking for those still waiting on the sidelines. In this wave of rapid transformation, Qubetics ($TICS) stands apart—not just by raising over millions in its 36th presale stage, but by building real solutions where legacy blockchains fell short. With its advanced Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, deep cross-chain compatibility, and a design centered around usability, Qubetics isn’t following trends—it’s setting them. While Bitcoin is becoming a digital reserve, Qubetics is becoming the infrastructure for interaction, placing it at the top for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Functionality with Practical Utility Qubetics is a next-gen blockchain platform focused on solving real-world inefficiencies through a seamless digital experience. One of its most revolutionary tools is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, allowing for secure, real-time access to multiple blockchains—without relying on centralized exchanges or intermediaries. It’s a frictionless solution designed for both scalability and sovereignty, and it’s already catching attention from technically inclined participants and those navigating complex multi-chain ecosystems. Seamlessly managing DeFi yield pools on one blockchain, while trading NFTs on another—all from the same wallet interface. Smart contract execution, token swaps, and asset management flow smoothly between networks, removing the fragmentation and friction often associated with Web3 usability. In high-stakes scenarios such as managing liquidity across chains or avoiding bridge risks, the wallet serves as a direct answer to usability barriers that once stalled growth. This is not theoretical: Qubetics has raised over $17.5 million, sold more than 514 million tokens, and reached over 27,300 token holders in its 36th stage crypto presale . The current token price is $0.3064, and projections based on $TICS hitting $1 to $15 post-launch translate to ROI potentials between 226% and 4,795%. The numbers speak clearly—and that’s why it’s being listed among the best crypto to buy right now. For those looking at crypto presales with high conviction and real tech, Qubetics is a standout. Cronos (CRO): Market Confidence Wanes as Price Dips Below $0.10 Cronos, the EVM-compatible blockchain developed by Crypto.com, was once considered a prime DeFi destination thanks to its low fees and fast finality. However, the current momentum tells another story. The live price sits at $0.092159, down 6.05% in the last 24 hours, signaling hesitancy among participants and developers alike. Even with a daily volume of $27 million, traction appears to be slowing. As community members weigh their options for the best crypto to buy right now, Cronos is facing an uphill battle. Without delivering a new wave of utility or user experience improvements, it may find itself outpaced by more agile competitors offering what users need, now. Cosmos (ATOM): Inter-Chain Giant Faces Fresh Market Scrutiny Cosmos has long been praised for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. Through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, it enables sovereign chains to communicate and transact securely. But performance isn’t always enough to carry momentum. At a live price of $4.47 and a 7.16% decline in the past 24 hours, Cosmos is under increased scrutiny from participants seeking more user-centric and modern blockchain solutions. Even with a daily volume of $130 million, Cosmos must innovate faster to maintain its spot in future-forward portfolios. Community sentiment is shifting toward utility-rich, ROI-viable chains, and that spotlight is increasingly falling on projects offering more seamless integrations and scalable usability—hallmarks of the best crypto to buy right now. Institutional Signals and Market Timing: Why the Next Move Matters Metaplanet’s bold capital move—raising $21 million to acquire more Bitcoin—has done more than make headlines. It has validated the long-term staying power of blockchain-backed assets. This matters deeply for emerging projects. When major institutions adopt digital assets as strategic reserves, attention flows to the tools and platforms that can sustain those assets’ usability. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in—not just as a currency but as infrastructure enabling the decentralized economy’s growth. As markets shift and large players like Metaplanet raise stakes in Bitcoin, the ripple effects reach all corners of the ecosystem. Blockchains like Cronos and Cosmos must evolve rapidly or risk stagnation. Meanwhile, Qubetics has emerged at the perfect inflection point—presale still open, infrastructure tested, and multi-chain wallet adoption surging. For participants evaluating timing, utility, and long-term traction, the signals are clear. The path forward rewards readiness, not hesitation. When infrastructure meets purpose, opportunity follows. Right now, Qubetics is leading that equation. Conclusion: The Real Utility Behind the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now As institutions like Metaplanet strategically inject capital into Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly clear that digital assets are moving beyond speculation and into structured financial ecosystems. This momentum creates a ripple effect, drawing attention toward blockchain projects that prioritize usability, cross-chain functionality, and long-term adoption. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to buy right now , not just for its impressive presale metrics, but for offering infrastructure that solves real challenges. While Cronos and Cosmos wrestle with performance dips and user engagement hurdles, Qubetics is delivering exactly what the market demands—secure, interoperable tools that streamline interaction across networks. Qubetics stands at the forefront of meaningful blockchain innovation. For those seeking not just potential returns but real-world relevance, this is where the smart money is heading. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is driving Qubetics ($TICS) presale momentum? Its real-world utility, non-custodial wallet, and interoperability features are capturing strong support, with over $17.5 million raised. How is Metaplanet’s $21M Bitcoin purchase relevant to new crypto projects? It signals deep institutional confidence in digital assets, driving attention to infrastructure tokens like $TICS that support real-world functionality. Why are Qubetics, Cronos, and Cosmos being compared now? Because their current activity reflects how the market is distinguishing utility-led projects from those with legacy features and slowing innovation.
