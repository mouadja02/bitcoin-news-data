2025-05-31T06:41:10,"Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?","The post Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets slid on Friday as fresh tariff concerns once again discouraged investors. Bitcoin is down over 2% today, trading at $103,700. Smart contract platforms also took a big hit as Solana fell 6.3%, Sui dropped 7.8%, and Avalanche slid 7.3%. Crypto stocks were also affected as Bitdeer (BTDR) sank 8.3% after a big rally, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) dipped 2.7% and Coinbase (COIN) lost 1.3%. U.S.-China Trade Tensions Startle Crypto Markets The rising U.S.-China tensions are back in focus after a brief truce earlier this month. President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday, which had a major impact on their short-term price action. Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today-11/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-05-31T06:29:13,"Block: A Quick Recovery, Now At A Crossroads (Maintain Strong Buy)","Summary Block's post-earnings selloff was overdone - recent product launches and its bitcoin business justify the stock's rapid recovery. Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE. Meanwhile, EPS is inflecting underpinned by robust subscription & services segment growth. I believe there's plenty of reason to remain bullish, as described in this article, so I believe there's plenty of reason to remain invested or initiate a position in Block stock. I rate the company a Strong Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791373-block-a-quick-recovery-now-at-a-crossroads-maintain-strong-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC|XYZ",cryptocompare

While nothing in crypto is ever guaranteed, many see this as a rare chance to get in early on a project with serious upside. Don’t miss the run, XYZVerse might just be the next moonshot Monero Monero (XMR) has experienced significant price movement recently. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 115.45%. In the last month, it climbed 32.98%. However, the past week saw a decline of 13.03%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XMR is trading between $363.54 and $447.06. The nearest resistance level is $475, and the nearest support is at $308.04. If the price breaks above $475, it may target the second resistance at $559, an increase of about 18%. If it falls below support, it could drop to the second support at $224.52. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.28, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold conditions, which might signal a potential price rise. With a 10-day Simple Moving Average of $347.51 below the 100-day SMA of $385.54, there is a short-term bearish signal. The MACD level at -3.8161 supports this, while the Stochastic at 57.76 is neutral. These indicators suggest Monero may consolidate before moving significantly. Given its strong performance over recent months, if XMR breaks above resistance, it could continue its upward trend. Conclusion While XMR could triple due to Bitcoin’s rise, XYZVerse offers greater potential with its sports memecoin ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth and community-led success.

The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11. The total crypto market cap has seen roughly $200 billion gone in the past two days and is down to $3.360 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-05-31T06:00:04,"Bitcoin Difficulty Set for Another Jump—How High This Time?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin network Difficulty is set to go up in the next adjustment and is estimated to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Difficulty Will Go Up Again In The Upcoming Adjustment The “ Difficulty ” refers to a feature present on the Bitcoin blockchain that dictates how hard the miners currently find their task of mining blocks on the network. The feature exists to ensure just one thing: that the rate at which miners add blocks to the chain remains constant. Whenever miners solve a block, they receive a block subsidy as compensation, so by locking the speed of these chain validators, the Difficulty makes it so that they get this reward at a consistent pace as well. The reason Satoshi programmed the Difficulty into the blockchain lies in the nature of the block subsidy itself. The coins miners earn from it are freshly minted, meaning that every time they solve a block, the total supply of the cryptocurrency goes up. If miners could indefinitely speed themselves up by simply adding more computing power, the asset’s supply would be flooded with tokens. But thanks to the existence of the Difficulty, this runaway inflation is an impossible scenario. That said, miners can deviate from their usual pace for short periods, as the Difficulty doesn’t show an immediate change. More specifically, there is a window of about two weeks between each network adjustment. The adjustments are fully automatic, with the Difficulty being changed exactly enough in them to bring the miners back to the standard pace of a block every 10 minutes. The next adjustment is set to occur later today at midnight, UTC. Below are the details related to this event from CoinWarz . As is visible, the Bitcoin miners have taken an average of 9.58 minutes per block during the last couple of weeks, suggesting that they have been faster than the network wants. The BTC blockchain will now respond with an increase in Difficulty, which is currently estimated to be of about 4.35%. The last adjustment also led to an increase in the indicator, although it was a notably smaller one. This new jump would take the metric to around 126.95 terahashes, which is a new record. The ATH in the Difficulty is arriving as the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate , a measure of the total computing power employed by the miners, has been inching toward a new high as well, as data from Blockchain.com displays.

2025-05-31T05:30:44,"Bitcoin’s Price Sees Drop as Altcoin Traders Face Increased Pressure","Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

2025-05-31T04:00:13,"Panama Canal Could Prioritize Bitcoin-Paying Ships, Mayor Suggests","Panama City’s mayor, Mayer Mizrachi, put forward an unusual plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29. He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ A Push For City-Level Crypto Mizrachi has also backed letting people pay city fees—taxes, fines and permits—in Bitcoin, Ether and USDC. He raised the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which produces over half of the nation’s GDP. He noted he wouldn’t need more laws to start one. But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

2025-05-31T03:57:58,"Best crypto presales to buy as Bitcoin sees renewed volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slipped 2.5% and 5%, respectively, on Saturday after President Donald Trump accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, reigniting fears of escalating trade tensions. The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

2025-05-31T03:00:51,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows","Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up?

2025-05-31T03:00:36,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Presale Momentum, ETH Upgrades, SOL & ADA Developments","With new data emerging and notable upgrades taking shape, several leading crypto assets are catching attention this week. Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

That includes wind, hydropower and even nuclear energy. Miners have also tapped into waste gas projects, turning flared natural gas into fuel for their rigs. Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

The gesture was more than a photo-op. It signaled that Ripple wants to ease the tension between XRP supporters and Bitcoin purists. In the past, the two groups have sparred over fees, speed and now environmental impact. By giving away an artwork meant to spark debate, Ripple is saying, “Let’s talk, not fight.” Call For A United Crypto Front Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined in the show of goodwill. He called on all crypto players to pull together. He urged regulators to carve out clearer rules, and asked industry insiders to focus on serving the unbanked. Garlinghouse stressed that XRP and Bitcoin fans have more in common than they might think. He said it’s time to unite against outside pressures, like tightening regulations and market skepticism.

2025-05-31T01:00:48,"Bitcoin Will Soar, Altcoins Won’t—Charles Edwards Explains Why","In an interview with Korean crypto researcher Juhyuk Bak, also known as @JuhyukB, Capriole Investments CEO Charles Edwards laid out a striking divergence in the crypto asset markets: while Bitcoin could double this year, altcoins remain structurally impaired and far from any meaningful rotation. Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

2025-05-30T22:15:00,"China Bans Holding of Bitcoin and All Cryptocurrencies, Report Says","China reportedly banned individual crypto holdings, intensifying its crackdown and boosting the digital yuan agenda. Bitcoin fell below key support at $107K, with RSI nearing oversold territory and volume showing limited recovery. Altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Cardano posted deeper losses, while stablecoins held steady amid growing regulatory uncertainty. On May 30, 2025, China introduced a new nationwide ban prohibiting the personal ownership of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, according to a report by Binance. The updated policy expands earlier restrictions on crypto trading and mining, now outlawing even individual holdings of digital assets. The move signals a deeper commitment by Chinese authorities to centralize financial control and promote the adoption of the digital yuan, the country’s state-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC). Bitcoin Dips Below Key Support After China Crypto Ban Report Following the unverified report about China banning personal crypto holdings, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply, confirming immediate market reaction.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, the head of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) Labs, Pär Helgosson, claims that the Champions League final-bound French footballing giant is currently holding BTC. “When I say PSG is the club of the new generation, I mean we’re about what’s next. Just like Bitcoin… Last year, we put Bitcoin in our books. We took our fiat reserves and we allocated Bitcoin. We still have it in our books.

The PSG Labs head dropped the BTC bomb on the eve of PSG’s visit to the Champions League final against Italian juggernauts Inter Milan in Munich, Germany. The 2024 Champions League final had over 400 million viewers worldwide. The Super Bowl of the same year had approximately 124 million viewers.

2025-05-30T22:00:26,"Elon Musk’s Shocking DOGE Departure: Silicon Valley Politics Enters ‘Find Out’ Stage","BitcoinWorld Elon Musk’s Shocking DOGE Departure: Silicon Valley Politics Enters ‘Find Out’ Stage The intersection of technology, cryptocurrency, and politics is constantly evolving, and recent developments signal a significant shift. Elon Musk , a figure often at the center of these discussions, has reportedly stepped down from his role as a U.S. special government employee, where he unofficially led the Department of Government Efficiency, playfully dubbed ‘DOGE’. This move highlights the complex and sometimes fraught relationship between tech leaders and the political landscape, prompting many to question what comes next for Silicon Valley Politics . Elon Musk’s DOGE Departure and Its Implications The announcement of Elon Musk’s departure from the ‘DOGE’ initiative comes amidst a cooling relationship with the current administration and reported impacts on his businesses, such as slumping Tesla sales potentially tied to his public political stances. Despite stepping down, Musk acknowledged the opportunity to address government waste and insisted that the core mission of DOGE would continue. The initiative, since its inception, has been characterized by aggressive budget cuts, job reductions, and departmental shutdowns, inevitably stirring considerable controversy. This event serves as a potent symbol of the evolving dynamic between influential tech figures and government. As tech giants and their leaders wield increasing power and influence, their involvement in politics becomes more scrutinized, leading to what some are calling the ‘find out’ stage for Silicon Valley Politics . Beyond Musk: Key Discussions on the Bitcoin World Podcast The full implications of Musk’s departure and the broader trends shaping the tech and crypto worlds were recently unpacked on Bitcoin World’s flagship podcast, Equity. Hosted by Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, the episode delved into who else might be leaving the DOGE initiative and why this moment is critical for understanding the future of Silicon Valley Politics . The discussion on the Bitcoin World Podcast didn’t stop there. The hosts also covered several other major headlines impacting the Tech Industry News landscape: GameStop Bitcoin Purchase: The surprising news that GameStop bought $500 million worth of Bitcoin, sparking comparisons to the 2021 market frenzy. This move has significant implications for both the gaming retailer and the cryptocurrency market. Neuralink’s Valuation: Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface startup, Neuralink, raised $600 million, pushing its valuation to an estimated $9 billion. This highlights continued investor confidence in ambitious neurotechnology projects. NYT and Amazon AI Licensing Deal: A landmark agreement between The New York Times and Amazon signals how traditional media content is becoming a valuable asset for training and powering generative AI models. Nvidia Earnings Analysis: An examination of Nvidia’s recent earnings report, suggesting the forecast might be more optimistic than CEO Jensen Huang’s cautious remarks.

2025-05-30T22:00:23,"Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Has Failed to Boost Network Use: JPMorgan","In a new report, analysts at JPMorgan revealed that Ethereum’s latest upgrade, Pectra, has not increased network activity, although it brought technical improvements and made Ethereum more attractive to large financial institutions. Nevertheless, the real use of the blockchain remains slow. Daily transactions and wallet activity have not increased, and retail interest is still low. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Brought Major Improvements After much anticipation, the Pectra upgrade launched on Ethereum earlier this month with notable improvements. It made staking easier , gave bigger rewards, and made deposits and withdrawals faster. Ethereum’s market cap and price also increased significantly. The Pectra upgrade also added new standards like ERC-3643 and ERC-1400. These features were designed to help comply with financial laws such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). These changes aim to help Ethereum work better with traditional finance. The support from Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a major U.S. financial group, shows Ethereum’s growing role in regulated financial markets. Ethereum Focuses on Institutions Over Everyday Users JPMorgan believes Ethereum is following a path similar to Bitcoin by targeting large investors rather than individual users. While other blockchains focus on memecoins and retail trading, Ethereum is trying to attract serious companies and financial players. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), more institutional investors are betting on Ethereum’s future. Long positions in Ethereum’s future have gone up sharply. However, spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have only seen small investments compared to Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs gained massive inflows after President Donald Trump won the election in November 2024. Ethereum Network Activity Still Low Despite these growing institutional interests, Ethereum’s on-chain activity has not improved. Reportedly, daily transactions and active wallets on the network remain low. Likewise, Gas fees have plummeted. While reduced gas fees benefit users, they also suggest weaker demand. Notably, the rise of Layer 2 solutions helps lower costs and moves traffic off the leading Ethereum network. JPMorgan analysts also raised concerns over Ethereum’s circulating supply. Since the Dencun upgrade, more ETH has been released, raising fears that Ethereum might become inflationary again. Analysts at JPMorgan continue to carefully consider Ethereum’s future. In February, the bank said Ethereum will still face strong competition from other blockchains. On the other hand, Bitcoin is expected to stay ahead of Ethereum and other coins until at least 2025.
