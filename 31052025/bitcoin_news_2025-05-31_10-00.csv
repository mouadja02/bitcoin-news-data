2025-05-31T07:45:32,"Crypto Market Surges Past $3.5 Trillion as Institutions, DeFi, and Stablecoins Drive a New Era","The international cryptocurrency market has surged beyond an incredible $3.5 trillion in total capitalization, producing one of the most seismic rallies in digital asset history. At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin. That momentum looks set to continue; but strength is spreading across the broader ecosystem as well pic.twitter.com/j6g3IeDJ7F — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 29, 2025 Aave stands out among singularly-focused protocols, leading the decentralized lending market with an approximate total value locked of $25 billion. The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:40:57,"Bitcoin Dips 5% from Last Week’s High, But Strong On-Chain Support Near $100K Signals Potential Rebound","Recently, Bitcoin has had a notable correction and has come down about 5% from last week’s peak. This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:37:54,"Saudi Prince Drops $100 Million on XRP. Here’s What This Means for XRP","Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud has invested $100 million into XRP through a strategic partnership with publicly traded company VivoPower International PLC (NASDAQ: VVPR). In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.

2025-05-31T07:37:42,"Ethereum Outshines Bitcoin as Exchange Outflows Spike and Whales Move Funds","This week, the crypto markets have put Ethereum in the spotlight, with the altcoin outperforming even Bitcoin and signaling a distinct change in investor sentiment. Massive amounts of ETH have flowed out of exchanges, suggesting that a move into cold storage has taken place. Cold storage is when traders move their assets off exchanges and into hardware wallets, a storage solution that is much more secure than keeping crypto on an exchange. Ethereum appears to have very secure long-term holders. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Exchange Outflows Suggest Strategic Accumulation This week, Ethereum saw extremely large volumes of coins leaving centralized exchanges, which is an indicator that has usually foreshadowed an increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. When Ethereum and other altcoins are moving off exchanges in large amounts, it’s a net positive for their prices. Although Bitcoin has had a relatively stable price, Ethereum has performed significantly better and continued to do so over the same timeframe. This performance differential, along with net outflows, signals a change in sentiment. Investors seem to be moving into ETH as they anticipate major events that could catalyze the price. This sentiment has been intensified by recent spot inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. On May 29, those funds recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million. The funds, in fact, are riding a streak of nine consecutive days of positive net inflows. With these kinds of consistent inflows, Ethereum ETFs are a way for institutions and retail investors to access Ethereum in a regulated manner. And this kind of demand for something like an Ethereum ETF is a sign of growing accessibility for crypto. On May 29 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $359 million, ending a 10-day streak of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million, marking a 9-day streak of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Dormant ICO Whales Awaken: Massive ETH Movements Raise Eyebrows Together with the wider market, two Ethereum wallets from the time of the ICO have awakened from long dormancy and are now making huge transactions that have caught the eye of blockchain analysts. An early participant in the Ethereum ICO has an address tied to it and at one time held a mind-boggling 1 million ETH. Just five hours ago, this address moved 959.69 ETH to the OKX exchange. At current market valuations, the transferred amount is approximately worth $2.54 million. Despite this massive transaction, the address still retains a whopping 50,704 ETH on-chain, valued at around $132 million. 这次是两个 ICO 巨鲸一起发力了，成本都是低至 0.31 美金的大佬 1⃣ ETH ICO 100 万枚 $ETH 巨鲸 5 小时前向 #OKX 充值 959.69 ETH，价值 254 万美元；链上仍剩余 50704 ETH，价值 1.32 亿美元 https://t.co/JFVlWHNe7N 2⃣ 2015 年 ICO 10 万枚 $ETH 的 OG 3 小时前向 #Kraken 充值 587 ETH，价值… https://t.co/xOj0szBX2C pic.twitter.com/5Rh5zgUmVE — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) May 30, 2025 Not only is this address’s holding large, but it also has a significant historical context. According to blockchain records, this wallet acquired its ETH during the ICO at the astonishingly low price of around $0.31 per coin. Such moves made by early adopters can be interpreted in various ways — they may have been profit-taking or involve a kind of strategic reallocation. This week also saw news emerge about a second wallet, believed to be associated with a participant in the 2015 Ethereum ICO and currently holding around 100,000 ETH. Just three hours ago, this wallet transferred 587 ETH to Kraken, which, at the current market rate, equates to about $1.56 million. Since March 13, 2023, the same address has sold a total of 14,398 ETH, bringing in approximately $28.47 million at an average price of $1,977. This slow and almost laboriously drawn-out sell-off pattern indicates that if this address is indeed a whale, it’s presently exiting either the Ethereum or Web3 space, or diversifying its assets. Market Implications and the Road Ahead These synchronized actions create a many-sided depiction of Ethereum’s contemporary condition. On one side, institutional investors are embracing Ethereum with a swift-paced buying frenzy, as shown by the ETF inflow now stretching across nine consecutive days. On the other side, a handful of very old and very large Ethereum holders — some of which have been clutching their assets since the Ethereum ICO back in 2014 — are starting to sell off portions of their holdings after nearly a decade. Even with these substantial sales, ETH’s price has held strong, thanks to the collective confidence in the crypto market and because of the dwindling supply of liquid Ethereum resulting from the cold wallet migrations. If the current trend of outflows holds, Ethereum may see less of an obligation to sell and more of a platform for price increases. Ethereum 2.0 is in a progressive stage of its upgrades, layer 2 adoption is rising, and ETF inflows are on the upswing, putting Ethereum (ETH) in a robust position. Yet, even with all these positive developments, there is a group of investors who could still negatively impact Ethereum’s price in the near term. Those investors are the ICO whales. Ethereum is proving its relevance yet again as the crypto market heads into the second half of 2025. It’s not just a smart contract platform; it’s a maturing financial asset drawing interest from both long-term believers and institutional capital.

New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. According to the filing, Buffett has allocated most of the firm’s cash reserves to US Treasuries as of Q1 2025, followed by investments in equity securities at $263.735 billion. Berkshire also has a $36.892 billion cash position as of last quarter, which ended in March. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. If Warren Buffett’s investment firm were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest foreign holder of Treasury Securities, just behind France’s $363.1 billion, Ireland’s $329.3 billion and Switzerland’s $311.6 billion holdings. Berkshire’s push for yield on its cash comes after the firm offloaded $3.23 billion worth of shares in three US banking giants last quarter. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

An analyst suggests that holding the current range over the weekend will be key for the long-awaited rally back to $200. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Solana Hits Multi-Week Low Amid the crypto market pullback, most cryptocurrencies are recording a red Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) momentarily losing some key levels. Solana, one of the cycle’s leading Altcoins, followed the rest of the market and registered a 6% retracement in the daily timeframe. SOL has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. Over the past month and a half, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed multiple crucial levels, setting the stage for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the key $180 resistance despite hitting a three-month high of $187 a week ago. A reclaim of this key barrier could push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. Today’s price action has sent Solana to a 22-day low of $156 after losing its $164-$180 price range and the $160 support zone for the first time since the May 8 breakout. Trader and analyst Crypto Bullet shared a bearish outlook for Solana, suggesting that the token will underperform for the rest of the year. He highlighted SOL’s trading pair against ETH, noting that the cryptocurrency has been in a rising wedge in the weekly chart since the Q4 2024 rally. According to the SOL/ETH chart posted by the trader, the cryptocurrency has broken down out of the formation after losing the 0.069 mark. To Crypto Bullet, this signals that “ETH will soon pump way harder than SOL.” All Eyes On SOL’s Weekly Close Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Solana is attempting to continue Weekly Closing within its Range High resistance, which is key for its long-term rally. He previously explained that the cryptocurrency re-entered its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range after successfully reclaiming the $120 barrier last month and consolidating within the $160-$175 range high. To the analyst, SOL’s price “needs to continue demonstrating price stability” around this zone, as that is what is “required for SOL to break out from this range into the $200+ levels.” He affirmed that Solana needs to aim for a retest similar to late 2024, when the cryptocurrency built a base around the Range High ahead of the breakout with multiple weekly closes near the resistance zone, which led to a massive breakout to the $200 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight? Rekt Capital highlighted that SOL has been successfully retesting this area as support over the past few weeks. However, he warned that cryptocurrency mustn’t close below the current price zone as it would “tease a possible loss of this region as support.” A drop below this range could lead to a retrace into the Range Low, between the $120-$135 mark. “Price stability at the Orange Range High going forward is thus key here,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $159, an 11.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday , which had a major impact on their short-term price action. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1B Today: Time to Exit and Take Profits? , Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T06:29:13,"Block: A Quick Recovery, Now At A Crossroads (Maintain Strong Buy)","Summary Block's post-earnings selloff was overdone - recent product launches and its bitcoin business justify the stock's rapid recovery. Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE. Meanwhile, EPS is inflecting underpinned by robust subscription & services segment growth. I believe there's plenty of reason to remain bullish, as described in this article, so I believe there's plenty of reason to remain invested or initiate a position in Block stock. I rate the company a Strong Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791373-block-a-quick-recovery-now-at-a-crossroads-maintain-strong-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC|XYZ",cryptocompare

Table of Contents XYZVerse is redefining memecoins: Could this be the next 50x breakout? Monero Conclusion Analysts forecast that XMR and XYZ could potentially triple in value. This prediction is based on their strong connection to Bitcoin’s current market trends. The possibility of such significant gains has captured the attention of investors and market observers. Could these cryptocurrencies be poised for remarkable growth in the near future? XYZVerse is redefining memecoins: Could this be the next 50x breakout? The hype is building fast around XYZVerse , a rising memecoin that’s blending sports fandom with crypto culture — and early signs suggest it’s not just hype. With bold ambitions and a unique approach, the project is eyeing a massive 50X surge post-launch. You might also like: ETH, BNB didn’t get much hype at launch, just like XYZVerse which ranks among the leading cryptos Early presale access: Big discount, bigger potential The presale is heating up, offering XYZ tokens at a steep discount compared to the projected listing price. As of Stage 12, the token has already jumped from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with over 70% of the $15 million presale target raised. The final presale price is set at $0.10, giving early investors a chance to lock in serious upside. XYZVerse has already earned a spot on CoinMarketCap, where community sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, 95% of voters expect the token to grow. Influencers are also taking notice. DanjoCapitalMaster, who commands nearly 800,000 followers, recently endorsed XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” Not just another memecoin, it’s a movement Unlike most memecoins that rely on hype alone, XYZVerse is creating a real niche, merging the energy of global sports with the virality of meme culture. This unique positioning is driving rapid presale progress and attracting a growing wave of early believers. Backed by strong tokenomics and real utility XYZVerse isn’t just chasing momentum, it’s building with intention. Its tokenomics are designed for longevity, including: 15% allocated to liquidity for post-launch stability 10% reserved for community airdrops and rewards 17.13% dedicated to deflationary burns to help drive long-term demand The team is also actively engaging its audience, launching an Ambassador Program that rewards community advocates with free tokens. Plans are underway to onboard sports personalities and expand visibility even further. Real partnerships, real use cases A major step forward came with the partnership with bookmaker.XYZ , a decentralized sportsbook platform. This move brings real-world utility to the token, letting the community go beyond speculation and actually use XYZ in a sports-betting ecosystem. https://twitter.com/xyz_verse/status/1907433069201518625 As part of the partnership, XYZ holders unlock an exclusive bonus on their first bet, an added incentive that rewards early supporters and deepens the token’s real-world utility. By bridging the gap between traditional sports culture and the high-speed world of crypto, XYZVerse is creating more than just another memecoin, it’s crafting a dynamic, entertainment-driven ecosystem built for real engagement. Is XYZVerse the next big memecoin? With a surging presale, an active community, and a bold roadmap, XYZVerse checks all the boxes for breakout potential. While nothing in crypto is ever guaranteed, many see this as a rare chance to get in early on a project with serious upside. Don’t miss the run, XYZVerse might just be the next moonshot Monero Monero (XMR) has experienced significant price movement recently. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 115.45%. In the last month, it climbed 32.98%. However, the past week saw a decline of 13.03%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XMR is trading between $363.54 and $447.06. The nearest resistance level is $475, and the nearest support is at $308.04. If the price breaks above $475, it may target the second resistance at $559, an increase of about 18%. If it falls below support, it could drop to the second support at $224.52. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.28, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold conditions, which might signal a potential price rise. With a 10-day Simple Moving Average of $347.51 below the 100-day SMA of $385.54, there is a short-term bearish signal. The MACD level at -3.8161 supports this, while the Stochastic at 57.76 is neutral. These indicators suggest Monero may consolidate before moving significantly. Given its strong performance over recent months, if XMR breaks above resistance, it could continue its upward trend. Conclusion While XMR could triple due to Bitcoin’s rise, XYZVerse offers greater potential with its sports memecoin ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth and community-led success.

The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11.

2025-05-31T06:00:04,"Bitcoin Difficulty Set for Another Jump—How High This Time?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin network Difficulty is set to go up in the next adjustment and is estimated to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Difficulty Will Go Up Again In The Upcoming Adjustment The “ Difficulty ” refers to a feature present on the Bitcoin blockchain that dictates how hard the miners currently find their task of mining blocks on the network. The feature exists to ensure just one thing: that the rate at which miners add blocks to the chain remains constant. Whenever miners solve a block, they receive a block subsidy as compensation, so by locking the speed of these chain validators, the Difficulty makes it so that they get this reward at a consistent pace as well. The reason Satoshi programmed the Difficulty into the blockchain lies in the nature of the block subsidy itself. The coins miners earn from it are freshly minted, meaning that every time they solve a block, the total supply of the cryptocurrency goes up. If miners could indefinitely speed themselves up by simply adding more computing power, the asset’s supply would be flooded with tokens. But thanks to the existence of the Difficulty, this runaway inflation is an impossible scenario. That said, miners can deviate from their usual pace for short periods, as the Difficulty doesn’t show an immediate change. More specifically, there is a window of about two weeks between each network adjustment. The adjustments are fully automatic, with the Difficulty being changed exactly enough in them to bring the miners back to the standard pace of a block every 10 minutes. The next adjustment is set to occur later today at midnight, UTC. Below are the details related to this event from CoinWarz . As is visible, the Bitcoin miners have taken an average of 9.58 minutes per block during the last couple of weeks, suggesting that they have been faster than the network wants. The BTC blockchain will now respond with an increase in Difficulty, which is currently estimated to be of about 4.35%. The last adjustment also led to an increase in the indicator, although it was a notably smaller one. This new jump would take the metric to around 126.95 terahashes, which is a new record. The ATH in the Difficulty is arriving as the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate , a measure of the total computing power employed by the miners, has been inching toward a new high as well, as data from Blockchain.com displays.

2025-05-31T05:30:44,"Bitcoin’s Price Sees Drop as Altcoin Traders Face Increased Pressure","Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

2025-05-31T03:57:58,"Best crypto presales to buy as Bitcoin sees renewed volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slipped 2.5% and 5%, respectively, on Saturday after President Donald Trump accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, reigniting fears of escalating trade tensions. The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

2025-05-31T03:00:51,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows","Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up? Likewise, Binance inflow data shows that certain investor groups are not eager to sell their BTC, possibly anticipating further gains.

2025-05-31T03:00:36,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Presale Momentum, ETH Upgrades, SOL & ADA Developments","With new data emerging and notable upgrades taking shape, several leading crypto assets are catching attention this week. Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

That includes wind, hydropower and even nuclear energy. Miners have also tapped into waste gas projects, turning flared natural gas into fuel for their rigs. Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

2025-05-31T01:00:48,"Bitcoin Will Soar, Altcoins Won’t—Charles Edwards Explains Why","In an interview with Korean crypto researcher Juhyuk Bak, also known as @JuhyukB, Capriole Investments CEO Charles Edwards laid out a striking divergence in the crypto asset markets: while Bitcoin could double this year, altcoins remain structurally impaired and far from any meaningful rotation. Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

2025-05-31T00:00:03,"Crypto Bulls See $644M Bloodbath As Bitcoin Dips Below $105,000","Data shows a large number of long liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency market as Bitcoin and other assets have plunged. Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? It would appear that both versions of this metric (tracking transactions valued at more than $100,000 and $1 million) surged to a high level earlier in this month, a potential sign that profit-taking from these humongous entities forced Bitcoin toward a top. Bitcoin Price BTC saw a dip under the $105,000 level earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since observed a small rebound as it’s now back at $105,800.
