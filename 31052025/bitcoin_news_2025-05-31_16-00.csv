2025-05-31T13:40:15,"Brazil's Méliuz offers stocks to add more Bitcoin to treasury","Brazilian firm Méliuz has announced a share offering to fund the purchase of additional Bitcoin for its treasury. According to the firm, it plans to raise 450 million reais (about $78 million) to purchase the leading digital asset, a move that has caused its shares to tumble over 8%. Méliuz, which trades in the cashback and coupon business, trades on the B3 exchange in Brazil under the ticker CASH3. The company initially plans to offer about 17 million common shares to raise around 150 million reais (approximately $26.2 million). The company also left enough space to expand the offering by up to 200%, which could see it triple the amount if demand goes as planned. Méliuz embraces Bitcoin amid its transformation The latest announcement marks a new chapter in the company’s transformation, moving from a traditional fintech to what can be described as the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil. Since March, when the company made a $4.13 million Bitcoin purchase, Méliuz has accumulated around 320.2 BTC, currently worth $33.55 million. It also became one of the first fintech companies in Brazil to offer crypto exposure to its clients, with this new step a way to increase its involvement in the industry. “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share,” the company said in a previous statement about its strategy shift. Markets appear to have priced in the news, with the company’s stock swinging wildly over the past year. The stock is up 217% since the beginning of 2025 at around 2.53 reais per share, climbing to a high of around 11 reais. The recent drop saw the price hit 8.13 reais, with trading volume hitting 6.51 million shares. According to Ray Nasser, the head of the Latin America branch of trading firm BlockFills, Méliuz has been adopting the same strategy as Michael Saylor-owned Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). He mentioned that the move has been able to help its shareholders get better value for their money. “The company lost its relevance over the years, and its stock price went down,” he said. “Although it made a turnaround in 2024, it’s doing what Strategy is doing now, it’s riding the hype.” Comparison to Strategy and Bitcoin adoption The firm has earned the compliment of being compared to United States firm, Strategy over the last few years. Strategy kickstarted the big-scale Bitcoin adoption in the United States, with the firm now holding about 580,250 Bitcoins, worth over $60 billion, using several capital raises. During the bull run, the company’s stock outperformed Bitcoin itself, creating what some analysts called a “Bitcoin proxy” for investors. But Méliuz carries out its operation differently, with the company’s market cap hovering around 305 million reais ($53.8 million), a fraction of its 9 billion reais peak after it went public in 2020. Meanwhile, the company has set its pricing for June 12, with trading of the new shares beginning on June 16. The company has scheduled two priority subscription periods for existing shareholders, with the first expected to start on June 4 after a June 3 cutoff date, and the second expected to end on June 10, after a June 9 cutoff date, allowing them to own the new shares first. The company was founded in 2011 and has built its business on cashback rewards and discount coupons, partnering with over 1,000 brands and accumulating 35 million registered users. Méliuz started offering Bitcoin exposure to clients back in 2022 when PayPal and other companies showed positive results experimenting with crypto purchases.

2025-05-31T13:15:46,"Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs","The post Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s safe to say most of us did not see this coming! Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , briefly climbed higher than Bill Gates on the global wealth chart. But as quickly as it happened, a Bitcoin price drop pulled Nakamoto back down. Still, the moment sparked a fresh wave of interest in crypto’s most famous ghost and the fortune they’re quietly sitting on. Bitcoin Rally Pushed Nakamoto Ahead of Gates Nakamoto’s wallet, believed to hold 1.1 million BTC – around 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply – recently reached a massive $113.8 billion , according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham . That briefly put him ahead of Bill Gates , whose fortune stood at $112.9 billion , based on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires list . It was enough to make Nakamoto the 12th richest person in the world , if only for a moment. The surge was driven by optimism around a potential U.S.–China trade deal , which helped push Bitcoin’s price higher. But the Lead Didn’t Last Long The crypto market, as always, had other plans. Bitcoin’s price slipped again, bringing Nakamoto’s estimated net worth back to around $114 billion as of May 31, 2025 . Meanwhile, Gates’ net worth has risen to $166.3 billion , putting a wide gap back between the two. Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, Anyway? Nakamoto’s true identity remains one of crypto’s biggest unanswered questions. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, people have speculated that it could be Nick Szabo , Len Sassaman , or Peter Todd . In 2024, a documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery pointed the finger at Peter Todd but he quickly denied any connection. That only added to the legend of Satoshi: a billionaire who might not even know they’re currently one of the wealthiest people alive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation , Could Nakamoto Catch Up to Elon Musk? Topping Elon Musk , who currently has a net worth of $422.7 billion , would be a much bigger jump. For Nakamoto to match Musk, Bitcoin would need to skyrocket to $406,000 per coin. It sounds far-fetched, but in crypto, strange things happen all the time and this recent Gates moment proved that anything’s possible. Crypto’s Wealth Race: Who’s Next? This back-and-forth between Nakamoto and Gates shows just how unpredictable crypto can be. If Bitcoin rallies again, Nakamoto could easily reclaim the edge especially with Gates’ wealth holding steady. As the market keeps moving, the crypto world is watching closely – because in this game, one price spike could change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined for three consecutive days, hitting a low of $2,500. That’s a 9.8% drop from its monthly high. Despite the pullback, it has outperformed most altcoins, many of which have fallen more than 15% from their highs this month. ETH retreated ahead of June, which is usually its worst month, because of the start of summer. CoinGlass data shows that the average monthly performance in June since 2016 is minus 7.4%. Its median monthly return in June is minus 8.68%. ETH monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass June is also Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) second-worst-performing month after September, with an average return of minus 0.35%. Seasonality does not always work out. For example, ETH dropped by 18% in March, bucking a four-year trend of gains. It also dropped by 31% in February, after recording positive gains in the last six consecutive years.

2025-05-31T13:05:37,"Trader Says Bitcoin Could Crash by Double-Digit Percentage Points After Confirming Downtrend – Here Are His Targets","Analyst and trader Justin Bennett believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) has further room to fall after the crypto king broke down. Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has a “confirmed break” after falling below a support level at around $106,000. According to Bennett, Bitcoin could fall by up to around 13% from the current level to a price of about $91,790 if BTC loses support levels that are around $100,730 and then $97,762. “Those downside targets are in play as long as $106,000 holds as new resistance on the daily time frame.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst and trader further says that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum ( ETH ), could turn bearish as USDT dominance, the percentage of USDT’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, rises. “This is the same Tether dominance outlook as eight days ago, and now we have a confirmed breakout. There are no guarantees, but you have to respect what’s on the chart, not what you hope will happen. If it holds, BTC and ETH pull back. Keep it simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Turning to Ethereum, Bennett says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is leaning bearish after breaking below an ascending trendline on the four-hour chart. “A little speculative right now, but I’d be willing to bet that ETH breaking this trend line opens up $2,460 and $2,360. Today’s fakeout above range highs gives Ethereum a bearish tilt. That said, markets could chop around while some of these supports hold.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,365 at time of writing, while Ethereum is trading at $2,605.

2025-05-31T12:51:49,"Bitcoin’s Path to $300K Could Face Geopolitical Risks, While Emotional Trading Add Uncertainty","Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally to an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22nd has ushered in a wave of heightened investor expectations. The surge, catalyzed by a sudden bullish breakout following the White House’s decision to delay 50% tariffs on EU goods, has since been tempered by geopolitical uncertainty and clear signs of market overexuberance. Social Chatter on Bitcoin Santiment’s data shows a sharp uptick in crowd optimism precisely as Bitcoin peaked, which led to an immediate correction. This is a reminder that extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks. Positive sentiment across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram hit its highest point this year on May 22, only to be swiftly reversed when President Trump’s tariff threat caused market jitters. Although the federal court ruling on May 28 deemed the “Liberation Day” tariffs unconstitutional, offering temporary relief, Santiment warned that recurring tariff-related discussions are now a key driver of volatility. Mentions of “tariff” and “trade war” spiked on social media in the final days of May, mirroring patterns observed during the April correction. Despite the cooling, the crowd remains bullish. The most popular Bitcoin options call is now for $300K. This sentiment depicted rising long-term expectations despite near-term instability. Santiment’s report also explained the reliability of crowd sentiment as a counter-indicator, with extreme fear on May 25 coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound to $106K. Meanwhile, blockchain fundamentals continue to show strength. Over 147,000 BTC have exited exchanges in 2025, which reduced immediate sell pressure and suggested continued confidence among holders. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has declined steadily since mid-April, indicating that older coins are being reactivated. Such a trend is typically a bullish signal associated with ongoing price expansions. Santiment noted that these shifts suggest the rally is driven not solely by speculative frenzy. BTC’s Path Ahead BTC whales continue to shape market tops. On the day of Bitcoin’s ATH, there were 18,782 transactions of over $100,000. Interestingly, this was the highest since Trump’s inauguration in January, suggesting significant profit-taking by institutional players. In fact, one whale held a 40x leveraged position now worth $1.2 billion. As such, the report warns that a liquidation event below $104,810 could trigger a cascade of long positions unwinding. As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, data shows that emotional extremes and external shocks continue to dictate short-term moves, even as exchange flows and coin age metrics point toward deeper bullish foundations. The road to $300K may be steep, but investor expectations, like Bitcoin’s price, have never been higher.

2025-05-31T12:47:32,"Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It","The post Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Pakistan plans to allocate 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and create a national Bitcoin reserve amid political and economic instability. IMF raises concerns over the project’s viability and energy use, questioning its feasibility amid Pakistan’s high energy costs and weak grid. This week Pakistan’s recent announcement to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining was a remarkable move. Later this week they also said that Pakistan has plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , this update joined amid ongoing political tensions, financial distress, and border issues. While a normal impression might be optimistic, compared with countries like El Salvador , but it’s not very optimistic. While this initiative signals a potential policy shift in the country, but its direct and immediate impact on the Bitcoin price is anticipated to be very minimal, largely due to a confluence of significant domestic challenges and international scrutiny. Adding to the challenges, the IMF has questioned Pakistan and raised red flags about the move. Keep reading to know more. Economic Viability and Infrastructure Concerns The ambitious mining plan of Pakistan faces tremendous economic viability issues, and power generation is less of an issue than its per kWh charges. The country has commercial electricity rates which are hovering somewhere around $0.20- $0.22/kWh, and are considerably higher than those in competitive mining hubs like Iran, Kuwait and other countries. Moreover, an electrical engineer based in Pakistan highlighted that even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, the cost remains barely competitive for large-scale operations compared to other countries in the global Bitcoin mining. The pricing was a major issue, but beyond pricing, the nation’s power infrastructure presents further obstacles. As Pakistan’s grid suffers from inconsistent service, distribution and transmission losses. These are major risks for energy-intensive mining facilities. IMF Scrutiny and Regulatory Roadblocks Adding to these internal challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added red flags and asked several questions, as they said this announcement was done without IMF consultation. They voiced serious concerns regarding Pakistan’s plan like the rationale behind allocating such a substantial amount of electricity, especially given the country’s ongoing chronic energy shortages and declining countries fiscal conditions. Moreover, this external oversight clearly indicates the complexities involved in moving from a conceptual plan to a fully operational one. This creates an uncertain situation for Pakistan’s dreams related to Bitcoin crypto’s. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Appoints Special Assistant for Blockchain and Crypto in PM’s Cabinet , Limited Short-to-Medium Term Impact on Bitcoin Price While the move was strategic or chaotic still remains a question. But, if in case it does establish a Bitcoin mining facility in Pakistan. It wouldn’t send the BTC price to hit mars or jupiter, from one financially weakend country’s action. Its effort could incrementally contribute to the network’s security and global demand for Bitcoin in the long run, but no major outcome seems likely in the future. Moreover, the current viability challenges and the critical intervention from the foreign organization clearly hints that its direct influence on global Bitcoin price will likely remain limited in the short to medium term, only if they successfully set up their plan in motion. However, the long-run outlook totally depends on the broader market forces, global adoption trends, and major regulatory developments. These are the combined factors that are expected to continue to be the primary drivers of the future Bitcoin price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T12:42:37,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Football Club PSG Embraces Crypto","Paris Saint-Germain F.C. has confirmed its adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, making it the first major football club to officially add BTC to its financial books. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, revealed that the club began accumulating Bitcoin in 2024 and still holds it as part of its reserves. This announcement arrives just as PSG prepares for the Champions League final, bringing both the sporting and financial spotlight onto the club. PSG also shared plans to support Bitcoin ventures and founders, signaling a deeper commitment beyond holding assets. PSG’s Bitcoin Strategy May Influence Sports and Crypto Alike Paris Saint-Germain isn’t new to experimenting with crypto—its fan tokens and Web3 initiatives go back years. But converting fiat reserves into Bitcoin and holding them long-term is an entirely different commitment. This isn’t a marketing gimmick or a temporary flirtation with blockchain. This is treasury allocation—something previously seen in corporate circles, now adopted by a leading sports brand. What’s striking is not just the move itself but the context around it. PSG’s fanbase is largely under 34, a demographic already entrenched in digital assets. The club’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin reflects an understanding of its own audience and a belief that future value will be driven by crypto-native systems. JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 Through PSG Labs, the club is not only holding BTC but actively seeking to invest in and accelerate crypto projects, startups, and builders. This approach could spark a new playbook for other top-tier clubs and sports leagues. If PSG’s venture into Bitcoin pays off—not just financially, but reputationally—it’s likely that others in the sports and entertainment space will follow. Crypto could evolve from niche sponsorships and collectibles into a structural pillar of how major teams manage wealth, foster innovation, and engage their fanbases. For the crypto ecosystem, this signals the return of a serious wave of institutional curiosity—one that could prove longer lasting than the last cycle. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Adoption Spikes Across Industries SUBBD PSG’s treasury announcement has a major cultural impact on the crypto space and among most sports enthusiasts. And if there’s any other space currently undergoing a cultural reset, it’s the creator economy. SUBBD enters this scene with a purpose that goes far deeper than tipping tools or platform gimmicks. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to shift control back into the hands of creators, where the value generated by communities isn’t skimmed by middlemen but retained and grown collectively. SUBBD's native token acts as a currency within a fully integrated ecosystem, supporting creator tokens, community rewards, and governance participation. What elevates this from just another creator token is its commitment to long-term sustainability through a dual-burn and staking protocol, where both creators and fans can lock tokens to influence project direction and receive incentives. In a world where institutions like PSG are leveraging blockchain to connect directly with their audiences, SUBBD’s relevance only increases. Just as PSG is using Bitcoin to realign its financial model with its youthful fanbase, SUBBD is giving online creators a similar mechanism to build loyalty, reward participation, and remain self-sufficient without relying on third-party platforms. This fact was highlighted by top crypto content creator ClayBro in one of his dedicated videos about SUBBD and its potential. If tokenized loyalty is the future of audience engagement, then SUBBD is already building the roads. It doesn’t just fit into a world shifting toward crypto—it builds a necessary bridge between creative energy and economic value. BTC Bull The timing of PSG’s announcement is no coincidence, as it arrives at a moment when Bitcoin has moved from speculative asset to strategic reserve for both companies and now, apparently, elite football clubs. BTC Bull operates on this very principle: that Bitcoin’s importance is no longer theoretical. It’s a financial axis. BTC Bull is a meme-forward project, but beneath its tongue-in-cheek branding lies a calculated reward model. It ties token airdrops and supply burns directly to Bitcoin’s price milestones. The higher BTC climbs, the more it unlocks value for BTC Bull holders. This setup isn’t just fun—it’s incentive engineering based on the most proven crypto asset on the planet. There’s no staking here, no confusing DeFi mazes. BTC Bull thrives on simplicity and strategy. The project doesn’t just comment on Bitcoin’s trajectory—it’s structurally tied to it. With PSG now declaring that BTC is part of its own treasury, Bitcoin-based narratives are gaining cultural gravity. BTC Bull rides that gravity without needing to chase headlines—it lets the market’s natural movements steer its mechanics. What makes BTC Bull relevant now is precisely what made PSG’s move newsworthy. Both rely on Bitcoin not just for storage, but for signaling. As BTC inches toward mainstream institutional acceptance, projects like BTC Bull that embrace its rhythm, rather than mimic unrelated trends, could find their value rise not from hype—but alignment. Snorter As PSG leans into Bitcoin to remain relevant to a digitally fluent fanbase, it makes sense to highlight tools that mirror that efficiency and reach. Snorter is built around that same principle: get closer to users, eliminate friction, and prioritize speed. Snorter is a Solana-based Telegram trading bot that doesn’t just notify—it executes. It was created to solve a very real problem: the delay and fragmentation in how people discover and snipe new tokens. While most traders are stuck switching between listings, wallets, and charts, Snorter keeps everything in one flow inside Telegram, with lightning-fast execution and a clear interface. What makes Snorter particularly potent in this moment is its alignment with changing user behavior. The crypto community, especially the under-30 crowd—the same demographic PSG is actively targeting—is already platform-native. They prefer lightweight, immediate tools over bloated exchanges. Snorter understands that, and delivers. The platform also includes token screening features and curated alerts, making it more than a snipe tool—it’s a mobile-first trading companion. And in an age where legacy brands are integrating blockchain to keep pace with their digital audiences, tools like Snorter represent the infrastructure that makes that connection possible. It’s fast, context-aware, and tuned to the language of the next-gen trader. MIND of Pepe Paris Saint-Germain didn’t just move capital—it made a calculated attempt to connect with a younger, digitally native audience. That same instinct sits at the center of MIND of Pepe , a meme-driven project that’s more than just a nod to internet culture. It’s an AI-powered sentiment engine, constantly plugged into the social web to gauge mood, spot viral energy, and provide real-time market cues to its community. MIND of Pepe operates like a brain for traders in the meme coin space. Instead of relying on slow-moving analytics or gut instinct, the platform’s AI scans posts, discussions, and meme signals across social media to evaluate crowd psychology. It then translates those insights into data traders can act on—often before the market catches on. In a world where branding and timing can create more value than utility alone, MIND of Pepe serves as a toolkit for navigating volatility. It doesn’t just track what’s trending—it tries to understand why it’s trending. That matters in today’s crypto space, where signals move faster than price charts. Presale is over. 👁 $MIND can now be purchased at listing price until launch. https://t.co/YQZ9DDOMKJ pic.twitter.com/zZ9e3LMIH5 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 31, 2025 At the time of writing, the project has completed its presale having raised upwards of $11.9 million, set to hit top exchanges very shortly, with several developmental updates also set to drop in the coming months. PSG’s embrace of innovation through Bitcoin and Web3 ventures validates the need for tools that bridge behavior and technology. MIND of Pepe is building that bridge in the meme coin sector, proving that data-driven intuition and humor aren’t mutually exclusive. If the next bull market is driven as much by narratives as by numbers, MIND of Pepe could become a must-have lens through which many interpret the madness. Solaxy The crypto space is increasingly bifurcated—Ethereum with its institutional adoption and Solana with its performance and accessibility. Solaxy sees this not as a divide to pick sides in, but a rift to bridge. As a Layer 2 solution, it enables fluid interaction between both chains, giving users the speed of Solana and the security of Ethereum without compromising on either. Solaxy doesn’t pitch itself as yet another scaling solution—it positions itself as infrastructure for a future where chains are interoperable and utility is chain-agnostic. On top of its technical foundation, the project also offers high-yield staking via SOLX, its native token, which supports users who want to contribute to network stability while earning passive income. PSG’s entry into Bitcoin investment territory is a reminder that performance and future-proofing go hand in hand. It’s not enough to adopt crypto—you need to make it usable, relevant, and fluid for your audience. Solaxy’s mission reflects that thinking. It doesn’t just offer access to blockchains—it simplifies that access, making it frictionless for developers and investors alike. As more institutions look for entry points into DeFi, and more users demand smooth multichain experiences, Solaxy could play a foundational role. It isn’t waiting for demand to arrive—it’s building the road in anticipation. Best Wallet Token PSG’s Bitcoin treasury isn’t a tech stunt, but rather it’s part of a larger realignment toward digital-first value management. That realignment doesn’t just need assets. It needs tools. Best Wallet Token’s product is one such tool—built not for hype, but for utility that adapts as users evolve. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial wallet that supports transactions across over 60 blockchains. But what separates it from the noise is the depth of its ecosystem. Within the wallet, users can stake, access market insights, browse presales early via the Upcoming Tokens feature, and even manage their entire portfolio—all from one interface. The BEST token serves as more than just a currency within the platform. It provides access to perks, reduced fees, and early access advantages. As crypto adoption spreads from corporations to sports clubs to everyday users, having an intuitive, comprehensive platform matters more than ever. Best Wallet isn’t a niche tool—it’s a hub for navigating crypto without hopping between 10 tabs. Just as PSG restructured its reserves to reflect what the future might look like, Best Wallet gives everyday users a similar recalibration opportunity. It’s not about chasing the next trend—it’s about equipping yourself for everything that comes after. Conclusion We’re no longer in the phase where crypto is just circling the edges of culture. When billion-dollar clubs start locking Bitcoin into their reserves, it’s a cue that the game is changing. The projects above aren’t clinging to old mechanics—they’re building for where things are going next. In times like these, the difference between noise and signal is utility; and these ones speak clearly. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-31T12:40:03,"Pakistan Crypto Council schedules Monday meeting to clarify crypto policy","Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has announced a meeting of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Monday to discuss the confusion surrounding the crypto policy in the country. He wants to discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of the assets. This development comes after members and major stakeholders under his portfolio insisted that digital assets are still banned in the country. The Ministry of Finance released a statement regarding the meeting, noting that it will serve as a “strategic forum to deliberate on the evolving regulatory and legal framework surrounding digital currency and the broader crypto landscape in Pakistan.” Aurangzeb, who is also the chairman of the PCC, is expected to preside over the meeting, with Bilal Bin Saqib, his special assistant on blockchain and crypto also in attendance as the CEO of the council. Pakistan Crypto Council wants to address the legal status of digital assets According to the report, other members of the council will also be in attendance on Monday, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), secretary of the Law and Justice Division, and secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. The council is expected to review several items, which include the development of a regulatory framework to govern digital assets in Pakistan, aligning it with global standards and technological advancements. The main point of the meeting will be to discuss the groundwork to establish the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), a proposed autonomous body to oversee the digital finance and cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council wants to lay a foundation for a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. It also wants to look into the promotion and adoption of responsible blockchain technology, with a view to protect investors and enhance financial inclusion. “The upcoming meeting underscores the government’s commitment to shaping a future-ready financial infrastructure while ensuring stability and compliance in the emerging digital economy,” it added. Internal criticisms fuel the need for clarification The meeting was convened after conflicting signals from several figures within the government. Days ago, the SBP and the Financial Division informed the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that digital assets were banned in the country. It meant that all transactions and ownership of the assets were illegal under certain conditions. Although the SBP has walked back its stance on the assets, some stakeholders are still not sold. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal mentioned that the PCC was formed to look into the crypto policy, noting that the council was formed via an executive order without any legislative backing. He added that under the current SBP and SECP regulations, digital assets are banned in the country. “There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” he said. The executive director of the SBP, Sohail Jawad, also mentioned that the central bank had issued a directive on the legal status of digital assets, noting that its stance that it is illegal remains intact. He also mentioned that the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still recommending crypto-related cases to law enforcement for further action. However, he mentioned that a national working group on digital assets has been formed, and their suggestions will be communicated to the PCC. The parliamentary debate also coincided with the unveiling of the country’s government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the CEO of the PCC, Mr Saqib. According to the official statement from the Ministry of Finance, the unveiling was done in Las Vegas, United States, at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, with United States VP J.D. Vance in attendance. The Pakistan Crypto Council was launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.

This is not a temporary measure—it is clearly a notable indicator. Amidst economic, workforce, and political confusion, the crypto domain is doing very well. Bitcoin did achieve a new high (all-time high) of $112,000 before subsequently falling back to about $108,700—not much decline, but of no consequence in these markets. The technical indicators are overall reflecting a strong return of bullish momentum above $100,000 and the new ultra-high levels of institutional interest that have contributed to the excitement. Institutional Confidence Returns Many institutions have shown a lot more interest in Bitcoin ETFs, proving there is a strong, ongoing trust in this market. After the initial rally at the start of the year, analysts started to rely on ETF inflows to gauge new changes in people’s feelings toward the market. Because of the new injection of funds, Bitcoin’s market cap is now above $2.17 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin does much more than lead the crypto world—it is showing that it is a true competitor for value, like gold and other major assets. Price Volatility Remains The recent rally has had a few hiccups. Bitcoin dipped by 2.5% on the 23rd of May after the surprising announcement from President Donald Trump that he is proposing new tariffs on foreign imports (whether or not this is related is not known officially). His statement shook both the crypto markets and regular markets, but it was short-lived – the buyers entered the markets, and prices stabilized. Experienced crypto holders have seen volatility, but this is still shocking for later holders (particularly those entering via ETFs). 7-day BTC price chart by Coinbase Crypto Infiltrates Other Industries Bitcoin in traditional finance is altering the landscape for complementary industries. Gaming is the sector leading this change. The creation of online gaming focused on blockchain technology and decentralized gambling experiences is a disruption for the industry, especially crypto poker sites , allowing online users to play poker with the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. The advantages for users of these poker sites are apparent: provably fair algorithms, low transaction fees, a payout time of minutes instead of weeks, and user anonymity, an important component for those who are privacy-conscious. Where regular online casinos manage the online gambling market, we have seen crypto poker sites pop up, and the rules that oversee this online gambling vary significantly across countries. Being decentralized and having access to users’ crypto wallets allows these crypto poker platforms to let people play online poker without the usual banking limits, starting new trends in online gaming. The convergence of gaming and finance is indicative that Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are becoming more important. The convergence of DeFi with digital entertainment is clear that cryptocurrency is not limited to earlier adopters and an interested niche, it is becoming broadly accepted. Outlook for the Rest of 2025 Bitcoin continues to cause a stir, and the projections get bolder and bolder. Some analysts are now putting targets around $160,000 for Q4, contingent on regulations being leveled out and inflation continuing to be in check. But honestly, this hype still hinges on larger economic dynamics and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Institutional exposure looks solid, however, it is not a guarantee for success. ETFs basically have become the measuring stick for Bitcoin’s acceptance in mainstream finance. Right now, their actions are being closely examined. There are already Ethereum ETFs, and interest in similar products for Solana and other main cryptos is rising, causing more institutions to enter the crypto world. Prices in Bitcoin and crypto markets are still bouncing around wildly. Even so, large investors are now acknowledging Bitcoin’s role as a true asset class. This development might influence the industry as the years progress.

2025-05-31T12:30:47,"More Crypto Clarity: US SEC Says Most Staking Activities Are Not Securities","In a significant development for the industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance shared its view on crypto staking after the recent call for clear guidance on the sector. The SEC branch seeks to “provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets.” SEC Offers Clarity On Crypto Staking On Thursday, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued new guidance on Protocol Staking, affirming that most of these activities are not subject to US securities laws and “don’t need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act.” In its statement, the regulatory agency said that certain staking activities on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks are not considered securities transactions under federal regulations. The SEC explained that the new guidance addresses the staking of cryptocurrencies “intrinsically linked to the programmatic functioning of a public, permissionless network.” Therefore, these activities, including self-staking, self-custodial staking with direct third-party validators, and custodial staking where platforms stake assets on behalf of customers, don’t meet the criteria for an investment contract under the Howey Test and don’t involve the offer and sale of securities. Journalist Eleanor Terret highlighted that the SEC’s statement “is a big deal for ETF providers who want to offer staking,” as it clarifies that “staking in this format is generally not thought of as a securities transaction by the Division of Corporation Finance.” However, the guidance noted that it doesn’t address all staking practices: “This statement addresses Protocol Staking generally rather than all of its variations. Further, this statement does not address all forms of ‘staking,’ such as so-called ‘liquid staking,’ ‘restaking’ or ‘liquid restaking.’” ‘Stake It Till You Make It’? Following the news, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce stated that the new guidance “provides welcome clarity for stakers” as uncertainty surrounding regulatory views discouraged Americans from engaging in staking activities for fear of violating securities laws. “Providing Security is not a ‘Security,’” she affirmed, adding that the unclear rules “artificially constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality of proof-of-stake blockchains.” The new guidance follows the industry’s call for clear staking rules, where a coalition of nearly 30 industry players and advocacy groups urged the SEC to offer clarity. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Crypto Council for Innovation’s (CCI) Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) sent a letter signed by 29 industry giants to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 30. Acknowledging the SEC’s regulatory shift under the Trump administration, the letter argued that the existing securities disclosure regime was ill-suited for staking services, which are fundamentally technical instead of financial. The crypto coalition asked for clear, principles-based guidance for staking and staking services, citing the SEC’s March statement on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, to protect users while enabling the growth of the staking industry. However, not all SEC Commissioners agreed with the new guidance. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw expressed her discontent in a Thursday statement , claiming that “staff ignores how its conclusions conflict with that applicable law.” Crenshaw considers that the Division of Corporation Finance’s analysis “may reflect what some wish the law to be, but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based,” affirming that “This is yet another example of the SEC’s ongoing ‘fake it ‘till we make it’ approach to crypto – taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/more-crypto-clarity-us-sec-says-most-staking-activities-are-not-securities/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Caroline Crenshaw|crypto guidance|crypto regulation|Crypto Staking|Hester Peirce|SEC commissioner|Securities and Exchange Commission|staking guidance|Staking services|total|total crypto market cap|US SEC",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T12:26:02,"SEC forwards plan to freeze budget and trim staff headcount","The SEC is cutting back on staff and locking in its budget for next year. On Friday night, the agency said it’s asking Congress to keep its 2026 funding flat at $2.15 billion, the same amount it received for 2025. Along with the frozen budget, the regulator wants to slash its full-time headcount by nearly 10%, from 4,548 positions down to 4,101. This is one of the agency’s most aggressive decisions to scale down operations since hundreds of employees took early-exit packages over the past few months. According to Reuters , the SEC is bracing for an extended period of tighter operations. It’s already seen a wave of exits this year, with about 600 staff walking away. That exodus hit some departments especially hard. Between 15% and 19% of employees in critical divisions resigned over the span of a few weeks. The agency isn’t replacing them. Instead, it’s planning to keep things lean and work with fewer hands on deck. The current fiscal year ends in September, but this new plan shows the regulator is preparing for deeper structural changes heading into 2026. SEC says no more meme coin policing The SEC’s request for a trimmed workforce and flat budget also comes with a bit of a warning. If Congress dumps more responsibility on the agency, like folding in oversight from a US audit watchdog that could be shut down, the SEC may have to stretch its limited resources even further. That’s why the agency says the flat budget would still leave about $100 million in reserve, to deal with what it calls “a number of uncertainties.” There’s no list of what those are, but the implication is clear: expect more work, not more funding. Chairman Paul Atkins is scheduled to testify before the Senate on Tuesday to explain the numbers and the plan. The agency didn’t offer anything beyond what was already in its public filing. But the budget tells a story by itself: fewer people, same money, and a long list of things to do. Meanwhile, the SEC has officially walked away from meme coins. That decision became public back in February, when the agency declared that most meme coins aren’t securities under US federal law. That move effectively took meme coins off the SEC’s plate and off its radar just weeks after President Donald Trump launched his own coin, $TRUMP . The token exploded in value immediately, boosting Trump’s estimated net worth by billions on paper. Hester Peirce, one of the agency’s longest-serving commissioners, spoke about the decision during the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. In an interview with CNBC, she explained why the SEC is staying out of the meme coin scene. “Here was something where I saw a lot of interest in this out in the world — in meme coins — and it made sense for us to say, ‘People, if you are expecting that there’s SEC protection around these, you should not expect that,’” Peirce said. That approach fits the broader picture. With fewer people, a tight budget, and potential new responsibilities, the SEC is narrowing its focus. Degens looking for guidance or justice against meme coin scams aren’t going to find it here. The agency has moved on. You’re on your own.

This follows broader market volatility after a U.S. appeals Court reinstated Trump-era tariffs . The decision reversed an earlier International Trade Court ruling and is spooking risk markets, including digital assets like Solana. BREAKING US APPEALS COURT HAS JUST REINSTATED PRESIDENT TRUMP TARIFFS THAT WERE BLOCKED YESTERDAY pic.twitter.com/2J8e58zXMQ — FinFluential • Simplifying Stocks (@FinFluentialx) May 29, 2025 Technically, SOL has broken its key $165.94 support level and is now outside the bullish channel that had been in place since mid-April. The daily chart looks nasty: a series of red candles and a Three Black Crows pattern. The 50-day EMA at $159.60 has flipped from support to resistance, and the MACD momentum indicators are showing widening gaps and deepening red histograms – all bearish. Support levels: $141.60, $125.95, $112.04 Resistance zone: $176-$188 with strong rejection Momentum indicators: MACD bearish, RSI 46 Derivatives Liquidations and ETF Delays Fuel Bearish Sentiment The data shows a shift in sentiment around Solana. According to Coinglass, futures open interest fell 3.23% to $7.11 billion, and long liquidations were $18.98 million on Friday, while short liquidations were just $464,750. This represents a significant unwinding of leveraged long positions. Meanwhile, the delays in US spot Solana ETFs, despite six applications from Fidelity and VanEck, are capping the optimism. Polymarket has the approval odds at 82%, and some analysts, including VirtualBacon, are calling for post-approval targets of $440-$600, similar to Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally. However, until the SEC gives the green light, regaining $200 looks challenging. Institutional Growth and Network Expansion Offer Long-Term Promise; Solana Supported? Despite the short-term headwinds, Solana continues to attract institutional interest and foster ecosystem growth. Circle’s $250 million USDC mint on Solana in late May has added liquidity and expanded stablecoin utility – Solana now handles 34% of all stablecoin volume.

Look for support at $141.60; however, unless Solana forms a strong reversal pattern, such as a Hammer or Morning Star with MACD convergence and a retest of the 50 EMA, the path of least resistance remains down. Newbies should wait for clear reversal signals to enter, while experienced traders can look for volume confirmation on a breakdown or reversal. Without bullish momentum, Solana may not retest $200 anytime soon. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $1560, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

2025-05-31T12:00:00,"SEC statement marks break from Gensler era on crypto staking","In a pivotal shift for U.S. crypto policy, the Securities and Exchange Commission clarified on May 29 that most staking activities on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains do not constitute securities transactions—marking a major departure from the agency’s previously aggressive stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. The move, issued in a statement titled “Providing Security is not a ‘Security’,” alleviates legal uncertainty that had long stifled innovation and discouraged American participation in network staking. While the clarification is not a binding rule, it signals a more open regulatory posture under the current administration. It could also unlock significant growth in staking-related infrastructure, which is increasingly central to the operation and decentralization of modern blockchain networks. The SEC’s statement Hester Peirce, the Division of Corporation Finance and Commissioner, essentially captured the essence of the SEC’s approach by explaining that “certain proof-of-stake blockchain protocol ‘staking’ activities are not securities transactions within the scope of the federal securities laws.” Pierse clarifies that staking is a voluntary effort by users to secure a network, but the previous regulatory uncertainty has been discouraging for Americans. This “artificial constraint” harmed decentralization, censorship resistance, and, therefore, the credible neutrality of proof-of-stake-based blockchains. According to the Division of Corporation Finance, the statement applies to various groups of individuals and services, including those who stake assets individually or via the delegated-proof-of-stake platform, as well as staking-as-service providers, both custodial and non-custodial. Furthermore, the commission outlines in the statement that ancillary services associated with staking are not considered a securities offering. As an example of such ancillary services, the commission cites the provision of slashing coverage that returns staked crypto assets before the unbinding period ends, allowing the reward to be recalculated while maintaining the minimum amount of staked assets required for normal network operation. The statement follows the previously issued clarification noting that the SEC doesn’t apply securities offering laws to the mining of cryptocurrency. Generally, the clarification follows the logic of the commission’s other actions and statements made in the post-Gensler era, which began in 2025 when President Donald Trump directed his administration to loosen crypto sector regulation. Read more: Gary Gensler’s political testament. Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview One of the most notable differences was the abandonment of Gensler’s approach of labeling most cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, a status that led to legal battles and, therefore, slower development in the sector. A yet unnoticed victory Crypto Council for Innovation was one of the first to emphasize the importance of the change in the staking status. In a series of X posts, the organization pointed out that the new legal status outlines staking “as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract.” Alison Mangiero, head of staking policy, thanked the SEC for recognizing staking’s real purpose as a tool that provides network security without being a security itself. 1/ Huge win for staking and the wider crypto community. @SECGov now recognizes staking as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract. 👏 @AMangiero @TeamPOSA pic.twitter.com/jTfPq4ihjX — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) May 30, 2025 The shift in attention from wealth accumulation to the structural role of staking in PoS-based networks suggests that U.S. regulators are becoming more open-minded about the cryptocurrency sector. Interestingly, the clarification of staking status news was met with perplexity by many. In the comment sections of the news accounts, people asked if the news was bullish and, if so, why the prices weren’t going up. Some tried to deploy Grok AI to get the answers. One possible reason for such confusion is that Bitcoin and stablecoins largely dominated the 2025 crypto narrative, while proof-of-stake platforms were pushed out of the spotlight in crypto discussions. Ethereum, one of the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems, has been under fire as the Ether price declined throughout the year. “Bitcoin, not crypto,” became a popular motto among many influencers on crypto X. However, staking hasn’t gone anywhere. The staking ratio (a percentage of the supply of the staked crypto to the rest of the circulating supply) continues to grow across various blockchains. The Block indicates that as of Dec. 31, 2024, Ethereum’s staking ratio reached 28%, while other key PoS-based blockchains (i.e., Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot) saw staking ratios over 50%. It signifies a growing investor involvement in staking. Furthermore, the staking sector is undergoing a series of innovations. Mostly, they aim to provide stakers with more flexibility or unlocking liquidity while staking. It makes staking less demanding. Previously, it involved locking up crypto assets for a specified period, which could be unprofitable. The modern-day features help validators avoid missing out on profits while securing the network. The SEC’s clarification on staking may not carry the weight of formal legislation, but it represents a meaningful step toward deregulating the U.S. crypto landscape. While the news has yet to spark a surge in token prices or mainstream attention, it lays critical groundwork for future innovation. As staking continues to evolve—becoming more liquid, accessible, and central to blockchain infrastructure—the ability of U.S.-based users, developers, and service providers to participate without fear of legal ambiguity could catalyze a new wave of decentralization and growth. In short, the stakes have changed.

Blue Origin’s Tweet Sparks Buzz appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a leading crypto billionaire, is about to make history by flying to space with Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. A recent tweet exchange between Sun and Blue Origin has sparked excitement, hinting that his suborbital flight on the New Shepard rocket is coming soon. Hello @justinsuntron We look forward to seeing you in West Texas on a future New Shepard flight soon! https://t.co/jnBbcjHBAn — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) May 30, 2025 If this happens, Sun will be the first person from the crypto world to travel to space, showing how blockchain and space exploration can come together. A $28 Million Ticket to Space In 2021, Justin Sun won a charity auction by bidding $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard flight. The money went to Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, a foundation that supports 19 space-related charities focused on inspiring future generations in STEM fields. Though the flight was originally planned for 2022, it was delayed. But on May 29, 2025, Sun posted a tweet from inside a spacecraft simulator, suggesting the trip is back on. The flight might take place in July 2025, according to recent announcements, and Sun will fly with five other crewmates, including someone who won their seat with a $6 million ticket. Flying with a Star-Studded Crew Justin Sun won’t be traveling alone. He’ll be joined by five others, making this an exciting mission that combines the worlds of space and crypto. This group will mark a new chapter in how cryptocurrency interacts with space technology. Justin Sun in the Spotlight Sun has a history of making big headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.5 million to have a charity lunch with famous investor Warren Buffett. At that lunch, Sun brought top crypto figures like Litecoin’s Charlie Lee and eToro’s CEO Yonni Assia. Even though Buffett remains skeptical about Bitcoin, the meeting sparked important discussions about cryptocurrency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs , In 2025, Sun continued his high-profile appearances by attending a dinner with Donald Trump for top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin .

2025-05-31T11:48:50,"Shiba Inu price crashes as whales sell, burn rate slows","Shiba Inu price continued its strong downtrend on Saturday as whale investors sold and sentiment in the crypto industry worsened. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the biggest meme coin in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) chain, dropped for four consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.00001238, its lowest level since April 22. It has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. SHIB has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that SHIB whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion. Whale selling is a sign that they expect its price to keep falling. Shiba Inu whales are selling | Source: Santiment Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well as its total value locked stands at just $2.92 million. In contrast, Unichain , which Uniswap ( UNI ) launched earlier this year, has a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. The single biggest burn this week was an 18 million transaction that happened on Wednesday. It was common for SHIB to have over 1 billion burns a few months ago. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00001755 on May 12 as cryptocurrencies rallied. It then embarked on a strong downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001235, its lowest point since April 22. It has moved below the 50-day moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge is a bearish pattern comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next target being the year-to-date low of $0.00001033, down by 16% from the current level.

2025-05-31T11:45:51,"US Government May Be Forced To Impose Widespread ‘Financial Repression’ To Keep $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Burden Manageable: UBS","The global wealth manager UBS says that the US government’s massive $36.2 trillion debt burden may cause it to take more extreme financial measures. In a new report, UBS says that the US government may be forced to make its growing debt burden more manageable by turning to additional financial repression measures that would artificially lower the yield on government bonds. “We expect that, over the longer term, the US government may pursue both fiscal consolidation and financial repression – a phenomenon that already exists in some form in the US and many other countries – to contain yields and keep the high debt burden manageable.” One potential financial repression measure may be to reform the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks, according to UBS. “Presently, large US banks must hold equity capital against all assets, including high-quality ones like Treasuries. Loosening the SLR could be justified as supporting bank lending, but excluding Treasuries from capital requirements would incentivize banks to hold more Treasuries, potentially enhancing market liquidity.” UBS says the US is well-positioned to successfully implement financial repression measures, as long as they are put in place on a temporary basis. “For a country as large and wealthy as the US, widespread financial repression seems feasible and could enable the government to continue financing a growing debt burden without materially increasing its risk of default. Financial repression policies could be deployed temporarily to provide fiscal breathing room, allowing for budget consolidation and improvement, followed by a phase-out and a return to more conventional policy settings. In such a scenario, economic distortions should remain temporary and manageable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-31T11:40:09,"Sharplink to spend $1 billion for ETH treasury","Sharplink Gaming Inc. is one of the latest to employ Strategy’s playbook of accumulating crypto as reserve assets. However, instead of BTC, the company is looking to use it to acquire Ethereum (ETH). According to the S-5 prospectus filed on May 29, Sharplink will use a substantial amount of proceeds from the offering to purchase Ethereum. The offering, which will involve the sale of up to 72,051,288 shares of common stock, is estimated to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds based on the assumed sale of 12,624,668 shares at current prices. Sharplink plans to use proceeds from its offering to purchase Ethereum. Source: SEC Aside from its ETH purchases, Sharplink will also use part of the proceeds for general business purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and expanding its core affiliate marketing operations. The stock sale will be executed via an “at-the-market offering” structure, which will allow Sharplink to issue shares periodically through a sales agent or principal. Such a structure enables the company the flexibility to respond to market conditions without compromising its crypto acquisition and operational goals. Sharplink plans to accumulate Ethereum in reserves The announcement of Sharplink’s plans to raise $1 billion from its stock offering comes days after it raked in $425 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, offering to establish an Ethereum treasury. The $425 million raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming revealed Tuesday in a statement. The group reportedly bought 69,100,313 of the firm’s shares at $6.15 each. The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company’s primary treasury asset. Sharplink Gaming’s private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin will serve as chairman of Sharplink Gaming’s board of directors. Rob Phythian, founder and CEO, called the achievement “a significant milestone in Sharplink’s journey,” which marks an expansion beyond its core business. “On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” he added. The announcement of the initial $425 million raise caused Sharplink’s stock to surge over 400%, peaking at $52 and closing at $35.80 on May 27, though it later dropped 8% after the $1 billion filing, reflecting market volatility. Strategy has become the standard Sharplink is taking a page out of Strategy’s crypto-focused playbook with a bias for Ethereum rather than BTC. This is an interesting detail as the company’s interest in stacking Ethereum coincides with positive momentum in the ETH community. Much of that momentum comes from the Pectra upgrade as well as new leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, which has gradually helped the token recover from the sub-$2,000 region. Other publicly traded companies have also employed the Strategy playbook over the past couple of years. Good examples include medical device company Semler Scientific and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, who began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024. Those not using the playbook to acquire BTC aggressively have tweaked it to focus on other altcoins. While Sharplink will focus on purchasing ETH, companies like Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) are dedicating millions of dollars to acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries. Canadian firm Spirit is aiming to become the “Strategy of Dogecoin.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sharplink-gaming-stock-offering-eth-treasury/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|BTC|ETH|Sharplink|Strategy",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T11:33:47,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Post-$827M Liquidation Carnage – Can BTC Reclaim $104k Amid ETF Inflows?","Bitcoin has fallen to $103,570, down over 1.50% in the last 24 hours, with over $827 million in liquidations. Most of these were longs being forced to sell into a falling market, accelerating the decline. This wave of selling has added significant downward pressure, and we are now at multi-week lows. The liquidation spree serves as a reminder of the dangers of leverage in a volatile cryptocurrency market, where significant price movements can trigger automated sell orders. WHAT TF IS GOING ON IN THE MARKET Over $210 million liquidated in the last hour and over $830 million in the last 24 hours Buckle up boys and stay out of high leverage pic.twitter.com/M530ccZvSk — Vishal Techzone (@VishalSahu21) May 30, 2025 $827M liquidated, mostly longs BTC below key support, now trying to get back to $104K Volume is $52.38B as of today Macroeconomic Jitters and ETF Outflows Weigh In Beyond the immediate market chaos, macro and geopolitical risks are adding to the uncertainty. An insufficient US GDP number and ongoing tariff disputes from the Trump era are spooking investors. High-risk assets, such as Bitcoin, are being hit the hardest as caution spreads through the markets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a record $430.8 million outflow on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak. This is the largest single-day outflow since the ETF’s January 2024 debut, indicating that institutional players are becoming increasingly nervous.

While BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings remain at $70 billion, the outflows indicate a shift in sentiment. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels and Rebound Signs On the technical front, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish, as BTC has violated the upward trendline. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has broken below a rising trendline and is forming a descending triangle. This classic pattern, where lower highs converge to horizontal support, indicates more bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-period EMA is a ceiling at $106,932. The MACD is confirming this with a bearish crossover and red histogram bars. Key levels to watch: Support: $102,141 – if this breaks, we could see $100,799 or $99,356 Resistance: $106,409 – potential reversal point if patterns emerge* Reversal Watch: Bullish candlesticks (Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing) at support, MACD divergence, 50-EMA reclamation as reversal signs The short term is bearish, but a significant reversal with strong buying at support could take us back to $104K and beyond. But without reversal signs, be cautious, as the path of least resistance is down.

2025-05-31T11:30:51,"No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script","Bitcoin’s price slipped to $105,235 today, dropping 1.5% over the past 24 hours and falling 4.2% in the last week. Some market watchers see this dip as a pause before a major move. According to their charts, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another steep gain. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Historical Patterns Point To Rebound Based on reports from the analyst known as “Mister Crypto,” rounded-bottom formations and ascending triangles have marked every big Bitcoin rally. In 2013, when Bitcoin was trading under $10, it spent months in a smooth, curved base before breaking out and climbing past $1,000. A similar pattern showed up in 2017. After nearly three years of sideways action, the price finally exploded toward $20,000. The last cycle in 2021 also followed the same playbook, with almost four years of building a wide base before shooting up to nearly $70,000. Bitcoin will go parabolic. This time won’t be different! pic.twitter.com/0fEMMMclbD — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 29, 2025 Mister Crypto’s chart suggests that the period after 2021 has formed another base. If history plays out the same way, his forecast points to a breakout in 2025 that could send Bitcoin as high as $900,000—a 760% rise from today’s level. Analyst Charts Re-Accumulation According to charts shared by another analyst, Bitcoin often moves in stages. First, there’s an initial “leg up” that signals the shift from deep accumulation into a growing bull trend. Then, the price settles into a sideways “re-accumulation” phase before the final run. From 2019 through 2021, Bitcoin followed this path closely. Analysts note that from late 2023 into mid-2025, Bitcoin looks to be in that same re-accumulation phase. If this unfolds as in past cycles, the next big upswing could push Bitcoin into the $270,000–$350,000 range before any parabolic spike comes into view. Long-Term Holders Keep Adding Coins On-chain data shows long-term holders (addresses that haven’t moved their coins in over 155 days) are still piling on. Between March 3 and May 25, 2025, these holders increased their overall supply by nearly 1.40 million BTC. That pushed long-term holdings from 14,354,000 BTC to 15,739,400 BTC. In previous bull markets—like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021—long-term holders often sold during the rallies to lock in profit. Related Reading: Panama Canal Could Prioritize Bitcoin-Paying Ships, Mayor Suggests Today, though, they seem content to hold. If large pockets of Bitcoin remain off exchanges, fewer coins are available for new buyers. That could tighten supply and make sharp moves more likely once demand picks up. Looking Ahead In Uncertain Market Bitcoin has lost momentum recently, but many analysts feel these dips won’t last. At $105K region, the price sits below last week’s levels.

2025-05-31T11:20:59,"US court opposes a Coinbase user’s privacy appeal","The US government has urged the Supreme Court to reject a petition from James Harper, a Coinbase user seeking to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from accessing his cryptocurrency transaction records. In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield financial records held by the exchange. The government argued that Harper had voluntarily disclosed the information to Coinbase and that the IRS had acted within the law following a court-approved summons to obtain it. The filing also cited Coinbase’s privacy policy, cautioning users that information could be disclosed to law enforcement. IRS revealed underreporting of tax on gains from digital assets Harper’s case arose from a 2016 IRS investigation of pervasive underreporting of tax on gains from cryptocurrency. The IRS noticed a big difference between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin and the small number of taxpayers who reported their crypto earnings. Following these findings, the agency issued a “John Doe” summons that required Coinbase to hand over records about customers who trade in large amounts. Harper, who dealt in Bitcoin through Coinbase in relevant years, was against the IRS’s action. He, therefore, sued the agency, alleging that the IRS’s actions constituted an unconstitutional search of his financial information. However, lower courts disagreed with Harper’s claims, concluding that Coinbase’s records are business documents and not Harper’s private papers. They then gave the IRS the go-ahead to access the records. The government argued that Supreme Court precedent is on the IRS’s side. This is because it stressed that people have no expectation of privacy over financial records maintained by third parties Coinbase. It referred to past decisions on cases like United States v. Miller. The Supreme Court has not yet announced if it will take up the case. If it chooses not to, the First Circuit’s decision supporting the IRS will remain intact. The United States v. Miller case on privacy rights Following the United States v. Miller case, the US Supreme Court stated that people have the right to feel safe in their homes, papers, and belongings from unreasonable searches and seizures. This right cannot be violated, and no search warrants can be issued unless there is good reason, backed by an oath or confirmation, that clearly describes where to search and what or who to seize. The main topic of this case was what falls under this protection. If the government wants to search for evidence of a crime against someone, it must get permission first or have special urgent reasons that make the search reasonable. However, if the item being searched for is not protected by the Fourth Amendment and the way the search is conducted within reasonable bounds, then the rules do not apply. Concerning Harper’s case, the government highlighted that the Court of Appeals rightly dismissed the arguments made by the petitioner because they were both against the Court’s past decisions and lacking in merit. Coinbase reveals a data breach incident in its operations On May 15, Coinbase announced that it had been the victim of a data breach, where attackers had bribed support workers to provide them with the firm’s customer data. Customers’ names, account balances, and transaction histories were among the data taken. Coinbase also said the breach affected about 1% of its monthly transacting users. An example of those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. Following the incident, Coinbase faced multiple lawsuits. As of May 15 and 16, six legal complaints have been filed, with plaintiffs alleging that the exchange failed to implement adequate security measures and mishandled its response to the breach.

2025-05-31T11:19:38,"IMF Reveals Huge Flaws in Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Plan Amid Power Crisis","The post IMF Reveals Huge Flaws in Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Plan Amid Power Crisis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pakistan wants to mine Bitcoin with 2,000 megawatts of power it barely has. The announcement, part of a broader strategy to attract crypto and AI firms, has triggered an immediate backlash from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and for good reason. As the country wrestles with severe energy shortages and ongoing bailout talks, the IMF is demanding urgent answers. According to local news portal Samaa , officials are now facing “stiff questions” about how legal – or even logical – this mining push really is. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” said one government official involved in the negotiations. Here’s what you should know. Pakistan’s Crypto Play Falls Flat The plan, unveiled alongside the debut of Pakistan’s first Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference, was meant to signal a pivot toward digital finance. But the optics don’t match the infrastructure. Pakistan’s power grid is notoriously unreliable, with high transmission losses and blackouts still common. Meanwhile, industrial electricity rates hover around $0.22 per kWh – nearly 10x what miners pay in Texas. At that rate, mining one Bitcoin in Pakistan would cost a staggering $132,000, compared to the global average of around $40,000-$50,000. Even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, “the model falls apart,” warns local engineer Sana Zakir. “These subsidies may not be sustainable. Pakistan’s agreements with the IMF explicitly discourage blanket energy subsidies.” A Big Bitcoin Bluff! To make matters worse, the IMF claims it wasn’t even consulted about the plan. The Fund has flagged legal ambiguities surrounding crypto in Pakistan, raising red flags over the PDAA – the newly formed Pakistan Digital Asset Authority set to oversee exchanges, DeFi platforms, and tokenization efforts. This is a fundamental red flag. All the Right Ideas, All the Wrong Execution Pakistan does have potential. At least one can argue that it does. Cheap labor, untapped solar and hydro resources, and regional demand could have positioned it well – if the groundwork were there. But right now, it’s not. This was not a strategic move. It was a chaotic attempt to ride a wave without learning how to swim in the kiddy pool. Unless Pakistan overhauls its infrastructure, energy pricing, and regulatory clarity, it risks turning a high-profile initiative into a self-inflicted crisis. It surely wouldn’t be the first time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T11:09:19,"Pi Network Leverages Gaming with FruityPi App to Boost Engagement and Utility","The post Pi Network Leverages Gaming with FruityPi App to Boost Engagement and Utility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Pi Network launches FruityPi game to demonstrate real-world use of its tools like Pi Wallet and Pi Ad Network, boosting developer engagement. Despite new gaming utility, Pi coin faces selling pressure, dropping over 9%, with analysts predicting a possible slide to $0.40 before recovery. Pi Network is entering the gaming space to boost activity and show real use for its tools. The Pi Core Team has officially launched FruityPi, a new game app built to showcase how Pi’s tools, like the Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network, can be smoothly integrated into real-world applications. The Pi Core Team sees gaming as a perfect way to mix fun with real utility. Developers can benefit from Pi’s large, active community by getting more users, signups, and attention for their games. Gaming is a strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem. The new FruityPi game app shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers, while leveraging what the Pi community has… pic.twitter.com/8X8ULVYXEk — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 30, 2025 Pi Network Boosts Gaming with Real Utility Pi Network is inviting developers to build with its tools, like the Pi Wallet for in-game currencies and the Pi Ad Network for monetization. If the game becomes popular within the Pi ecosystem, then users could also apply to Pi Network Ventures. Earlier this month, PiCore launched a $100 million fund , Pi Network Ventures, to back projects building decentralized apps on Pi’s platform. Analyst Mr Spock shared a live example of real utility on the Pi Mainnet from the Fruity Pi app. He shared three key takeaways: Firstly, the mainnet utility is active, and Pi is being spent and accepted in real apps, which shows real adoption. Next, Sellers are independently setting their prices, such as 0.1 Pi for a power-up, so there are no fixed rates like the GCV (Global Consensus Value). Finally, the price is fully decentralized and controlled by developers and users, and not the Pi Core Team. He shared that this is a real example of real utility, real payment, and real decentralization at work, where the power to decide the price lies with the community. Pi Coin Drops Over 9% Pi coin is currently trading at $0.6177, and is down over 9% in the past day. Around 9.8 million tokens are set to be unlocked today, which will further add to the selling pressure. If Pi coin falls below the key level of $0.60, it could slide to April’s low of $0.40. Most technical indicators for Pi Coin show a bearish trend, with many oscillators and moving averages signaling “Sell” or “Neutral.” Overall, the charts point to a continued downward pressure on the price. Analyst Dr Altcoin has said that Pi’s price will likely drop until the end of August and then gradually recover. He says it could go down to $0.40, unless the Pi Core Team becomes more transparent. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T11:04:11,"Tap, Pay, and Go: SpacePay’s NFC Integration Brings Crypto Payments to Any Smartphone","The post Tap, Pay, and Go: SpacePay’s NFC Integration Brings Crypto Payments to Any Smartphone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency was supposed to change how we pay for things. Yet here we are, years later, still pulling out credit cards at coffee shops while our crypto sits unused in digital wallets. SpacePay tackles this challenge with a payment platform that features a 0.5% transaction fee, works with over 325 crypto wallets, and provides instant fiat settlements for merchants. The London-based startup has already raised over $1 million during their ongoing presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. Crypto Payments Without the Technical Mess Ask any shop owner why they don’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll mention the complicated setup or expensive equipment. SpacePay cuts through this complexity with a simple solution that works with existing Android payment terminals. No expensive hardware needed. Just a quick software update. The NFC functionality allows customers to simply tap their smartphones against payment terminals, just like contactless credit cards. This familiar gesture makes crypto payments feel natural and effortless. The system works with over 325 different cryptocurrency wallets. Whether you store crypto on a hardware wallet or keep everything on your phone, SpacePay processes the payment smoothly. This compatibility means customers can use what they already have instead of downloading another app. Protecting Merchants From Price Swings Here’s the nightmare that keeps businesses away from crypto: a customer pays with Bitcoin for a $100 purchase in the morning, but by afternoon, that payment is only worth $85 because the market crashed. SpacePay solves this with technology that protects merchants from volatility completely. When someone pays with Bitcoin, the business owner gets regular currency immediately. That $100 sale stays exactly $100 in their bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or soars five minutes later. The system freezes the exchange rate during the transaction. If Bitcoin’s price suddenly drops, SpacePay absorbs the difference instead of passing that risk to the merchant. Store owners don’t need to become crypto traders. They just see normal payments without the crypto drama. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Slashing Payment Costs That Hurt Small Businesses Credit card processing fees take between 2.5% and 3.5% from every transaction. Consider a local bookstore doing $30,000 in monthly sales. With traditional payment systems, they’re paying roughly $900 each month in processing fees. SpacePay changes this with their 0.5% transaction fee. That same bookstore would only pay $150 monthly – keeping an extra $750 every month. Over a year, that’s $9,000 staying in the business instead of going to payment processors. These savings come from eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Traditional systems bounce your money between multiple companies before reaching the merchant days later. SpacePay creates a direct path using blockchain technology, which maintains security while cutting excessive fees. Making Crypto Practical for Daily Life The technology behind SpacePay might be sophisticated, but the user experience is refreshingly simple. Most payment systems process transactions like cars moving through a single-lane tunnel – checking one thing at a time before moving to the next step. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. Think of it like having multiple security guards checking different aspects of an ID simultaneously. SpacePay checks wallet details, crypto balances, merchant info, and exchange rates all at once. This parallel processing explains why Bitcoin payments complete in seconds rather than minutes. Nobody stands around awkwardly waiting for confirmations. The transaction happens fast enough that it feels like any other payment method. Every transaction gets permanently recorded on the blockchain. It creates tamper-proof records protected by serious encryption. This distributed approach not only speeds things up but makes the entire system more secure than traditional payment methods. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes. Customers and merchants just see a clean, simple payment experience that works reliably every time. No technical knowledge required on either side of the transaction. The really clever part is how SpacePay handles the conversion from crypto to regular money. Most systems make this feel like two separate steps – first the crypto payment, then the conversion. SpacePay makes it feel like one smooth transaction where Bitcoin goes in and dollars come out seamlessly. Visit SpacePay Presale Real-World Adoption That Actually Works SpacePay isn’t building a solution for some theoretical future. They’re addressing real problems that prevent Bitcoin from being useful today. The platform already has plans to roll out across 4.5 million Android-based payment terminals in nine countries. This ambitious expansion works because SpacePay doesn’t force businesses to replace equipment they already own. The software-update approach means widespread adoption becomes possible without massive infrastructure investments. Early merchants testing the system report positive experiences. They appreciate the lower fees, instant settlements, and the fact that accepting Bitcoin doesn’t require becoming crypto experts. Customers enjoy finally being able to spend their digital assets at regular businesses without jumping through hoops. The $SPY token powers this ecosystem with features that extend beyond simple payments. Token holders receive monthly loyalty rewards, voting rights on platform decisions, and revenue sharing from transaction fees. This community-driven approach creates incentives for everyone to want SpacePay to succeed. How to Join the SpacePay Presale For those interested in joining the SpacePay ecosystem, the ongoing presale offers an entry point. Visit SpacePay’s official website and connect your crypto wallet to participate. The platform accepts various payment methods including ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDT, USDC, and traditional bank cards.

2025-05-31T10:58:25,"Digital Real Estate Rush: Bitcoin Solaris’s Fixed 21 Million Supply Creates Same Scarcity That Drove BTC News Headlines in 2013","The post Digital Real Estate Rush: Bitcoin Solaris’s Fixed 21 Million Supply Creates Same Scarcity That Drove BTC News Headlines in 2013 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the early 2010s, Bitcoin captured headlines because a limited group of users understood one thing early: fixed supply and functional access change everything. Today, Bitcoin Solaris is generating similar buzz from the deliberate replication of Bitcoin’s earliest value drivers — a capped supply, real distribution mechanics, and a technologically sound mining system accessible to anyone with a smartphone. As Bitcoin reached the mainstream, that window closed. Early buyers were rewarded not by luck, but by their timing against a hard-coded ceiling. That model isn’t coming back for BTC — but Bitcoin Solaris is proving that the conditions can exist again, for a limited time, under a modern framework. Bitcoin’s Scarcity, Rebooted Bitcoin Solaris follows the same scarcity-driven economics that made Bitcoin historically powerful: a fixed total supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens. But unlike Bitcoin in its infancy, this time the infrastructure is already prepared for adoption. Instead of clunky miners and command-line wallets, Bitcoin Solaris integrates directly with mobile devices. The model distributes value without diluting it. There are no hidden inflation mechanics, no token burns, and no emissions loopholes. Once the 21 million are distributed, that’s it. This architectural certainty is rare in a market dominated by variable token models, dynamic supply contracts, and investor dilution. And while Bitcoin took nearly a decade to enter retail awareness, Bitcoin Solaris has onboarded over 11,000 users in advance of its Nova App rollout — a user base ready to participate in the mobile mining economy the moment it activates. Helios Architecture: Scalability Without Compromise Bitcoin Solaris’s dual-layer blockchain combines a PoS + PoC base layer with a high-speed Solaris Layer, built on a hybrid of Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. The result is a decentralized system capable of 10,000+ transactions per second, two-second finality, and energy efficiency exceeding 99.95% compared to Bitcoin’s original mining framework. This architecture enables smartphone-level mining and massive user onboarding without the bottlenecks seen in Ethereum or Solana. It also ensures that BTC-S is not only scarce, but sustainably distributed at scale. For retail investors and early adopters, this creates a structural advantage that institutional models and legacy blockchains simply don’t offer. Presale Mechanics and Strategic Positioning Bitcoin Solaris is currently in presale phase 5, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. This marks the final stage before centralized exchange listings, where the token is expected to list at 20 USDT. Of the full 21 million supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) have been reserved for the entire presale allocation. But unlike other projects, this isn’t just a discounted sale. It’s an opportunity to acquire tokens before mining difficulty scales, before Nova App competition grows, and before centralized liquidity begins shaping price discovery. Presale participants are securing both financial leverage and early protocol presence. This phase won’t last indefinitely. As token demand rises in anticipation of live mining and CEX onboarding, each subsequent participant enters at higher pricing and higher competition levels. Audited and Verified for Market Readiness Bitcoin Solaris has completed multiple layers of third-party verification. A full Cyberscope audit reviewed the project’s smart contracts and consensus code. A Freshcoins audit validated the mobile mining infrastructure, and KYC verification confirmed the team’s identity and operational transparency. This level of diligence is rare in presale environments and offers retail participants an additional layer of confidence in an ecosystem already engineered for clarity. Crypto analyst Crypto Chester recently highlighted Bitcoin Solaris’s supply model as “the closest parallel to Bitcoin’s original scarcity framework since 2013,” pointing out how user access is now aligned with functionality — not just trading volume. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fixed supply made it iconic. Bitcoin Solaris brings that same principle to a network built for 2025 — not 2009. It doesn’t just replicate Bitcoin’s scarcity. It upgrades the delivery system, distributes rewards via mobile access, and ensures participation from over 11,000 users before exchange listings begin. With Phase 5 priced at 5 USDT and a ceiling of 21 million tokens, the window is open — but it’s not wide. Supply will run out. Listings will shift pricing. The only variable left is timing.

2025-05-31T10:46:57,"Stablecoins dominate the conversation at Bitcoin 2025","Stablecoins were the headline story at Bitcoin 2025 this week in Las Vegas, not Bitcoin. The three-day event, which pulled in a crowd of 35,000, saw major political names and crypto executives focusing heavily on dollar-pegged tokens, not the coin that started it all. According to CNBC, what dominated the stage was a growing political alliance pushing legislation to bring stablecoins into the core of US financial power. Vice President JD Vance showed up to deliver a full public endorsement of the space, becoming the first VP to speak directly to Bitcoiners. “I think it’s wrong, actually, to call this just a conference,” JD told attendees. “This is a movement. And I’m proud to stand with you.” JV also made it clear the White House now sees stablecoins as an asset. “We do not think that stablecoins threaten the integrity of the US dollar. Quite the opposite,” he said. “We view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.” Congress pushes stablecoin bill as GOP sets deadline Bo Hines, who runs the president’s Digital Assets Council, said stablecoin rails are being streamlined to secure the US dollar’s dominance “for decades to come.” Bo told CNBC the White House believes this could unlock trillions of dollars in demand for American debt from global buyers. The entire playbook is tied to a new bill, the GENIUS Act, now heading to the floor of the US Senate. Senator Cynthia Lummis told the crowd that a deal had been reached after weeks of negotiations with Democrats. “We think we have a final deal,” Cynthia said. “If we can get this passed, this will be the first piece of digital asset legislation to pass the US Senate.” A cloture vote is expected Monday. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer praised Senator Bill Hagerty for speeding up what he called a “calcified” Senate and said Republicans want to get both the stablecoin and market structure bills to President Donald Trump’s desk before August recess. “The president promised this,” Tom said. “We want it done now.” Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, said the stablecoin bill will reach the House Financial Services Committee by July. Bryan said it would allow issuers to buy US Treasuries at a crucial moment. “It enshrines the US dollar in our dominant role as the world’s reserve currency,” he said. Bryan also dismissed Democratic efforts to add an amendment that would block government officials from benefiting from stablecoin companies. That clause was reportedly aimed at the Trump family, who are linked to World Liberty Financial, the firm behind the new USD1 token. Tether expands while Wall Street builds competition The biggest issuer in the stablecoin space right now is Tether, and its CEO Paolo Ardoino said the next big use case will come from commodity traders, not banks. Paolo said Tether is ready for what’s next. “All the traditional financial firms will create stablecoins that will be offered to their existing customers,” he told CNBC. But he argued those firms are boxed in by their own high-fee business models. Instead of chasing wealthy users, Paolo said Tether is focusing on reaching the global majority who don’t have access to banks. “Many of our competitors say, ‘Oh, Tether is serving this niche of the unbanked.’ Half of the population of the world should not be called a niche,” he said. While Paolo was onstage in Vegas, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are in early talks to launch a joint digital dollar to compete directly with Tether. The battle between legacy finance and crypto-native firms is now on-chain. Kraken CEO Dave Ripley, who’s been in private talks with lawmakers, told CNBC the bill is critical to bringing big banks and brokers into the space. But he said there are still issues to resolve, like whether users can earn yield and what rules apply to politicians investing in stablecoin companies. “Crypto is all about individuals,” Dave said. “Let’s bring the value to them.” There’s also a loud change happening at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency once seen as the crypto world’s biggest problem. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said change was overdue. “For many years now, I’ve been complaining about the fact that the commission has not taken proactive steps to provide clarity,” Hester said. “Now finally, we’re at a place where we can do that.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-2025-stablecoins-overshadowed-btc/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT","News|BTC|USDC|USDT",cryptocompare

As of press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $103,555, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen a modest correction of about 0.14%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Turning to price predictions, Finbold consulted both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for insights into how the asset will likely trade by June 30. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price For starters, ChatGPT suggested that Bitcoin’s strong momentum could continue into the next month, with a base-case prediction of $118,000 by June 30, 2025. The model highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience at this level, backed by the possibility of renewed bullish sentiment. ChatGPT also noted that historical seasonality offers mixed clues, as June has seen pre-summer rallies and notable corrections in past years. At the same time, the broader macroeconomic environment could also play a key role. If global liquidity conditions improve or central banks cut rates, Bitcoin might benefit from increased capital inflows. The model also pointed to key technical resistance levels expected between $110,000 and $120,000, but if Bitcoin breaks through, a price as high as $130,000 becomes plausible. On the flip side, should Bitcoin face resistance or market sentiment sour, it could retreat to $98,000. ChatGPT estimates there’s a 65% chance that Bitcoin will finish June above $110,000, though breaking $130,000 would likely require a major bullish catalyst. Bitcoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok offered a more tempered outlook. Based on Bitcoin’s current price and historical volatility, Grok predicts that Bitcoin will trade around $108,000 by June 30. This assumes continued bullish sentiment supported by institutional inflows and favorable regulatory developments. However, Grok also pointed out that resistance near $110,000 could temper the rally, with a plausible range between $105,000 and $112,000. A pullback to around $95,000 is possible if Bitcoin’s momentum stalls. In summary, both AI models suggest Bitcoin is likely to remain above the $100,000 mark by the end of June 2025, with the potential to break higher if favorable conditions emerge. Indeed, as Bitcoin enters June, the asset is witnessing increased institutional demand , with several entities adding the asset to their treasuries. To this end, some analysts believe the move will likely create a supply shock and drive the asset’s price higher.

2025-05-31T10:35:40,"Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation","The post Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Public companies have accumulated more Bitcoin than U.S. spot ETFs over the past three quarters, signaling long-term strategic adoption. MicroStrategy leads with 580,250 BTC as corporate holdings reach 757,593 BTC, marking a structural shift in Bitcoin ownership dynamics. Publicly traded companies are steadily becoming major players in Bitcoin accumulation, surpassing even spot ETFs in net additions over recent quarters. Unlike the highly reactive nature of ETF flows, these corporate purchases are long-term, often held on balance sheets as strategic assets. Public Companies Are Buying More BTC Than ETFs According to a post by respected crypto analyst Ecoinometrics , public companies have added more Bitcoin to their balance sheets over the past three quarters than U.S. spot ETFs. These sustained purchases suggest a trend of structural demand, as corporate treasuries continue accumulating BTC with a long-term outlook. How Much Bitcoin Do Public Companies Hold? Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies now hold 757,593 BTC , valued at approximately $78.67 billion , representing 3.6% of the total BTC supply . Top 5 Public BTC Holders (by Market Cap): MicroStrategy : 580,250 BTC (~$60.25B) Marathon Digital Holdings : 48,237 BTC (~$5B) Riot Platforms : 19,211 BTC (~$1.99B) CleanSpark : 12,101 BTC (~$1.26B) Tesla : 11,509 BTC (~$1.19B) MicroStrategy remains the leader, purchasing an additional 133,988 BTC this year alone, with 26,695 BTC added in just the last month. Other notable increases in 2025 include: Marathon : +7,802 BTC Riot : +2,483 BTC CleanSpark : +2,804 BTC Tesla : +1,789 BTC These figures reflect growing institutional confidence in BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Spot ETF Holdings: Bigger, But More Volatile While public companies lead in new accumulation, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still hold more overall BTC. The top 12 ETFs combined hold 1,211,938 BTC , valued at around $125.85 billion , accounting for 5.77% of total BTC supply. Top 5 Spot Bitcoin ETFs: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) : 664,954.7 BTC (~$69.05B) Fidelity Wise Origin (FBTC) : 198,291 BTC (~$20.59B) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) : 186,706.1 BTC (~$19.39B) ARK 21Shares (ARKB) : 47,152.2 BTC (~$4.9B) Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) : 43,690.1 BTC (~$4.54B) However, ETF flows have been more mixed this year: IBIT : +113,036.1 BTC FBTC : -2,872 BTC GBTC : -18,692.8 BTC ARKB : +545.1 BTC Mini Trust : +5,677.2 BTC These fluctuations highlight the more reactive nature of ETFs compared to corporate treasury strategies. Why Corporate BTC Accumulation Matters Unlike ETFs that may adjust holdings based on short-term investor sentiment, corporations typically treat Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. This difference matters: ETFs = Liquidity-driven, reactive to market trends Public Companies = Sticky, long-term holders The result: corporate accumulation gradually removes BTC from circulation, creating structural demand that can support long-term price growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Bitcoin Market Snapshot Here’s how Bitcoin has performed recently: Timeframe Price Change Last 6 Months +7.52% Year-to-Date +11.1% Last 30 Days +8.99% Last 14 Days +0.25% Last 7 Days -4.09% Last 24 Hours -1.49% Final Thoughts As public companies continue to increase their BTC holdings quietly but consistently, their role in shaping Bitcoin’s long-term market structure is becoming more significant. These moves may not generate the daily headlines that ETF launches do—but they represent a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s role as a treasury asset. The next time volatility strikes, it might be the public companies—not ETFs—that provide the bedrock of long-term support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T10:20:34,"XRP Set for Big Gains? Experts Predict $10 to $23 Rally by Year-End","The post XRP Set for Big Gains? Experts Predict $10 to $23 Rally by Year-End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP could be gearing up for a major breakout. Experts predict that XRP could go as high as $10 by the year’s end. In an interview with Altcoin Daily , crypto analyst George Tung, the founder of CryptosRUs, said that he sees XRP hitting between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. He pointed to XRP’s ability to survive multiple market cycles and its solid fundamentals as the key reasons for his bold prediction. $8–$10 Targets Just the Start? Tung called the $8-$10 a conservative estimate for XRP. The rising institutional interest with several XRP ETFs in the making, are the key catalysts, he says. If the ETFs are approved, it could unlock massive demand and push XRP much higher in this cycle. XRP’s strong fundamentals make it a safer bet for new investors, compared to the hype driven meme-coins. In a broader market outlook, he expects Bitcoin to climb 1.5x to 2x, Ethereum 3x to 4x, and sees XRP’s 4x to 5x potential as realistic, especially if market sentiment improves and altcoin liquidity returns. He predicts Bitcoin could peak between $200K and $300K this cycle. Focus on Strong Projects, Limit Risky Bets He was asked if $1000 could be turned to $100,000 by year-end, to which Tung warned against chasing huge gains without understanding the risks. While memecoins like Pepe have made headlines, Tung noted that those big wins are rare now. He recommends users to put most of their money into solid, proven projects and allot just 5-10% for risky plays like memecoin. Bullish Predictions Virtual Bacon sees a buying opportunity for XRP, but only if it drops 20% or more compared to Bitcoin. He says this could play out in two ways: XRP falls while Bitcoin stays steady, or Bitcoin pumps and XRP lags. Both cases could push XRP into a strong value range. He calls it a classic mid-cycle pattern that often surprises the market. Davinci Jeremie, who said “XRP is going to zero”, now sees strong institutional interest and believes it could hit $24. XRP researcher SMQKE thinks XRP could beat Ethereum this year and go up to at least $6. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, expects XRP to rise to $13 or even $22, based on strong signs from its yearly price chart. Dark Defender says XRP is making a new pattern on the weekly chart that could push it up to $18.22 to $23.20 soon. He called $5.85 a key mid-level to watch and said this move matches their previous targets and a pattern from November 2024. He also shared that there may be some resistance along the way.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-set-for-big-gains-experts-predict-10-to-23-rally-by-year-end/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
