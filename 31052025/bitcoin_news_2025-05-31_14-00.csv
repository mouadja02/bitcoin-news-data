Blue Origin’s Tweet Sparks Buzz appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a leading crypto billionaire, is about to make history by flying to space with Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. A recent tweet exchange between Sun and Blue Origin has sparked excitement, hinting that his suborbital flight on the New Shepard rocket is coming soon. Hello @justinsuntron We look forward to seeing you in West Texas on a future New Shepard flight soon! https://t.co/jnBbcjHBAn — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) May 30, 2025 If this happens, Sun will be the first person from the crypto world to travel to space, showing how blockchain and space exploration can come together. A $28 Million Ticket to Space In 2021, Justin Sun won a charity auction by bidding $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard flight. The money went to Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, a foundation that supports 19 space-related charities focused on inspiring future generations in STEM fields. Though the flight was originally planned for 2022, it was delayed. But on May 29, 2025, Sun posted a tweet from inside a spacecraft simulator, suggesting the trip is back on. The flight might take place in July 2025, according to recent announcements, and Sun will fly with five other crewmates, including someone who won their seat with a $6 million ticket. Flying with a Star-Studded Crew Justin Sun won’t be traveling alone. He’ll be joined by five others, making this an exciting mission that combines the worlds of space and crypto. This group will mark a new chapter in how cryptocurrency interacts with space technology. Justin Sun in the Spotlight Sun has a history of making big headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.5 million to have a charity lunch with famous investor Warren Buffett. At that lunch, Sun brought top crypto figures like Litecoin’s Charlie Lee and eToro’s CEO Yonni Assia. Even though Buffett remains skeptical about Bitcoin, the meeting sparked important discussions about cryptocurrency. In 2025, Sun continued his high-profile appearances by attending a dinner with Donald Trump for top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin. He also met crypto leaders like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss twins at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. These actions highlight Sun’s efforts to raise TRON’s profile and influence in the crypto space. How Does The Crypto Community See This? The crypto community on X has been buzzing about Sun’s space plans. Influencer Wendy O said, “Justin is taking us to the moon,” celebrating this milestone. Others believe this trip could boost TRON’s visibility and push the crypto industry toward exciting new innovations. This mission may increase TRON’s visibility and inspire blockchain leaders to think bigger as the crypto world gets ready to reach new heights.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-billionaire-justin-sun-set-for-space-flight-blue-origins-tweet-sparks-buzz/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LTC","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T11:48:50,"Shiba Inu price crashes as whales sell, burn rate slows","Shiba Inu price continued its strong downtrend on Saturday as whale investors sold and sentiment in the crypto industry worsened. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the biggest meme coin in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) chain, dropped for four consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.00001238, its lowest level since April 22. It has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. SHIB has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that SHIB whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion. Whale selling is a sign that they expect its price to keep falling. Shiba Inu whales are selling | Source: Santiment Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well as its total value locked stands at just $2.92 million. In contrast, Unichain , which Uniswap ( UNI ) launched earlier this year, has a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. The single biggest burn this week was an 18 million transaction that happened on Wednesday. It was common for SHIB to have over 1 billion burns a few months ago. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00001755 on May 12 as cryptocurrencies rallied. It then embarked on a strong downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001235, its lowest point since April 22. It has moved below the 50-day moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge is a bearish pattern comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next target being the year-to-date low of $0.00001033, down by 16% from the current level.

2025-05-31T11:45:51,"US Government May Be Forced To Impose Widespread ‘Financial Repression’ To Keep $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Burden Manageable: UBS","The global wealth manager UBS says that the US government’s massive $36.2 trillion debt burden may cause it to take more extreme financial measures. In a new report, UBS says that the US government may be forced to make its growing debt burden more manageable by turning to additional financial repression measures that would artificially lower the yield on government bonds. “We expect that, over the longer term, the US government may pursue both fiscal consolidation and financial repression – a phenomenon that already exists in some form in the US and many other countries – to contain yields and keep the high debt burden manageable.” One potential financial repression measure may be to reform the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks, according to UBS. “Presently, large US banks must hold equity capital against all assets, including high-quality ones like Treasuries. Loosening the SLR could be justified as supporting bank lending, but excluding Treasuries from capital requirements would incentivize banks to hold more Treasuries, potentially enhancing market liquidity.” UBS says the US is well-positioned to successfully implement financial repression measures, as long as they are put in place on a temporary basis. “For a country as large and wealthy as the US, widespread financial repression seems feasible and could enable the government to continue financing a growing debt burden without materially increasing its risk of default. Financial repression policies could be deployed temporarily to provide fiscal breathing room, allowing for budget consolidation and improvement, followed by a phase-out and a return to more conventional policy settings. In such a scenario, economic distortions should remain temporary and manageable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-31T11:40:09,"Sharplink to spend $1 billion for ETH treasury","Sharplink Gaming Inc. is one of the latest to employ Strategy’s playbook of accumulating crypto as reserve assets. However, instead of BTC, the company is looking to use it to acquire Ethereum (ETH). According to the S-5 prospectus filed on May 29, Sharplink will use a substantial amount of proceeds from the offering to purchase Ethereum. The offering, which will involve the sale of up to 72,051,288 shares of common stock, is estimated to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds based on the assumed sale of 12,624,668 shares at current prices. Sharplink plans to use proceeds from its offering to purchase Ethereum. Source: SEC Aside from its ETH purchases, Sharplink will also use part of the proceeds for general business purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and expanding its core affiliate marketing operations. The stock sale will be executed via an “at-the-market offering” structure, which will allow Sharplink to issue shares periodically through a sales agent or principal. Such a structure enables the company the flexibility to respond to market conditions without compromising its crypto acquisition and operational goals. Sharplink plans to accumulate Ethereum in reserves The announcement of Sharplink’s plans to raise $1 billion from its stock offering comes days after it raked in $425 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, offering to establish an Ethereum treasury. The $425 million raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming revealed Tuesday in a statement. The group reportedly bought 69,100,313 of the firm’s shares at $6.15 each. The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company’s primary treasury asset. Sharplink Gaming’s private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin will serve as chairman of Sharplink Gaming’s board of directors. Rob Phythian, founder and CEO, called the achievement “a significant milestone in Sharplink’s journey,” which marks an expansion beyond its core business. “On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” he added. The announcement of the initial $425 million raise caused Sharplink’s stock to surge over 400%, peaking at $52 and closing at $35.80 on May 27, though it later dropped 8% after the $1 billion filing, reflecting market volatility. Strategy has become the standard Sharplink is taking a page out of Strategy’s crypto-focused playbook with a bias for Ethereum rather than BTC. This is an interesting detail as the company’s interest in stacking Ethereum coincides with positive momentum in the ETH community. Much of that momentum comes from the Pectra upgrade as well as new leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, which has gradually helped the token recover from the sub-$2,000 region. Other publicly traded companies have also employed the Strategy playbook over the past couple of years. Good examples include medical device company Semler Scientific and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, who began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024. Those not using the playbook to acquire BTC aggressively have tweaked it to focus on other altcoins. While Sharplink will focus on purchasing ETH, companies like Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) are dedicating millions of dollars to acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries.

Most of these were longs being forced to sell into a falling market, accelerating the decline. This wave of selling has added significant downward pressure, and we are now at multi-week lows. The liquidation spree serves as a reminder of the dangers of leverage in a volatile cryptocurrency market, where significant price movements can trigger automated sell orders. WHAT TF IS GOING ON IN THE MARKET Over $210 million liquidated in the last hour and over $830 million in the last 24 hours Buckle up boys and stay out of high leverage pic.twitter.com/M530ccZvSk — Vishal Techzone (@VishalSahu21) May 30, 2025 $827M liquidated, mostly longs BTC below key support, now trying to get back to $104K Volume is $52.38B as of today Macroeconomic Jitters and ETF Outflows Weigh In Beyond the immediate market chaos, macro and geopolitical risks are adding to the uncertainty. An insufficient US GDP number and ongoing tariff disputes from the Trump era are spooking investors. High-risk assets, such as Bitcoin, are being hit the hardest as caution spreads through the markets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a record $430.8 million outflow on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak. This is the largest single-day outflow since the ETF’s January 2024 debut, indicating that institutional players are becoming increasingly nervous.

While BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings remain at $70 billion, the outflows indicate a shift in sentiment. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels and Rebound Signs On the technical front, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish, as BTC has violated the upward trendline. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has broken below a rising trendline and is forming a descending triangle. This classic pattern, where lower highs converge to horizontal support, indicates more bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-period EMA is a ceiling at $106,932. The MACD is confirming this with a bearish crossover and red histogram bars. Key levels to watch: Support: $102,141 – if this breaks, we could see $100,799 or $99,356 Resistance: $106,409 – potential reversal point if patterns emerge* Reversal Watch: Bullish candlesticks (Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing) at support, MACD divergence, 50-EMA reclamation as reversal signs The short term is bearish, but a significant reversal with strong buying at support could take us back to $104K and beyond. But without reversal signs, be cautious, as the path of least resistance is down.

2025-05-31T11:30:51,"No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script","Bitcoin’s price slipped to $105,235 today, dropping 1.5% over the past 24 hours and falling 4.2% in the last week. Some market watchers see this dip as a pause before a major move. According to their charts, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another steep gain. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Historical Patterns Point To Rebound Based on reports from the analyst known as “Mister Crypto,” rounded-bottom formations and ascending triangles have marked every big Bitcoin rally. In 2013, when Bitcoin was trading under $10, it spent months in a smooth, curved base before breaking out and climbing past $1,000. A similar pattern showed up in 2017. After nearly three years of sideways action, the price finally exploded toward $20,000. The last cycle in 2021 also followed the same playbook, with almost four years of building a wide base before shooting up to nearly $70,000. Bitcoin will go parabolic. This time won’t be different! pic.twitter.com/0fEMMMclbD — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 29, 2025 Mister Crypto’s chart suggests that the period after 2021 has formed another base. If history plays out the same way, his forecast points to a breakout in 2025 that could send Bitcoin as high as $900,000—a 760% rise from today’s level. Analyst Charts Re-Accumulation According to charts shared by another analyst, Bitcoin often moves in stages. First, there’s an initial “leg up” that signals the shift from deep accumulation into a growing bull trend. Then, the price settles into a sideways “re-accumulation” phase before the final run. From 2019 through 2021, Bitcoin followed this path closely. Analysts note that from late 2023 into mid-2025, Bitcoin looks to be in that same re-accumulation phase. If this unfolds as in past cycles, the next big upswing could push Bitcoin into the $270,000–$350,000 range before any parabolic spike comes into view. Long-Term Holders Keep Adding Coins On-chain data shows long-term holders (addresses that haven’t moved their coins in over 155 days) are still piling on. Between March 3 and May 25, 2025, these holders increased their overall supply by nearly 1.40 million BTC. That pushed long-term holdings from 14,354,000 BTC to 15,739,400 BTC. In previous bull markets—like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021—long-term holders often sold during the rallies to lock in profit. Related Reading: Panama Canal Could Prioritize Bitcoin-Paying Ships, Mayor Suggests Today, though, they seem content to hold. If large pockets of Bitcoin remain off exchanges, fewer coins are available for new buyers. That could tighten supply and make sharp moves more likely once demand picks up. Looking Ahead In Uncertain Market Bitcoin has lost momentum recently, but many analysts feel these dips won’t last. At $105K region, the price sits below last week’s levels. Based on reports, some see that as healthy consolidation before a bigger run. Others warn that global interest rates, regulation, and macro factors could slow things down.

Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

2025-05-31T11:20:59,"US court opposes a Coinbase user’s privacy appeal","The US government has urged the Supreme Court to reject a petition from James Harper, a Coinbase user seeking to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from accessing his cryptocurrency transaction records. In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield financial records held by the exchange. The government argued that Harper had voluntarily disclosed the information to Coinbase and that the IRS had acted within the law following a court-approved summons to obtain it. The filing also cited Coinbase’s privacy policy, cautioning users that information could be disclosed to law enforcement. IRS revealed underreporting of tax on gains from digital assets Harper’s case arose from a 2016 IRS investigation of pervasive underreporting of tax on gains from cryptocurrency. The IRS noticed a big difference between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin and the small number of taxpayers who reported their crypto earnings. Following these findings, the agency issued a “John Doe” summons that required Coinbase to hand over records about customers who trade in large amounts. Harper, who dealt in Bitcoin through Coinbase in relevant years, was against the IRS’s action. He, therefore, sued the agency, alleging that the IRS’s actions constituted an unconstitutional search of his financial information. However, lower courts disagreed with Harper’s claims, concluding that Coinbase’s records are business documents and not Harper’s private papers. They then gave the IRS the go-ahead to access the records. The government argued that Supreme Court precedent is on the IRS’s side. This is because it stressed that people have no expectation of privacy over financial records maintained by third parties Coinbase. It referred to past decisions on cases like United States v. Miller. The Supreme Court has not yet announced if it will take up the case. If it chooses not to, the First Circuit’s decision supporting the IRS will remain intact. The United States v. Miller case on privacy rights Following the United States v. Miller case, the US Supreme Court stated that people have the right to feel safe in their homes, papers, and belongings from unreasonable searches and seizures. This right cannot be violated, and no search warrants can be issued unless there is good reason, backed by an oath or confirmation, that clearly describes where to search and what or who to seize. The main topic of this case was what falls under this protection. If the government wants to search for evidence of a crime against someone, it must get permission first or have special urgent reasons that make the search reasonable. However, if the item being searched for is not protected by the Fourth Amendment and the way the search is conducted within reasonable bounds, then the rules do not apply. Concerning Harper’s case, the government highlighted that the Court of Appeals rightly dismissed the arguments made by the petitioner because they were both against the Court’s past decisions and lacking in merit. Coinbase reveals a data breach incident in its operations On May 15, Coinbase announced that it had been the victim of a data breach, where attackers had bribed support workers to provide them with the firm’s customer data. Customers’ names, account balances, and transaction histories were among the data taken. Coinbase also said the breach affected about 1% of its monthly transacting users. An example of those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. Following the incident, Coinbase faced multiple lawsuits. As of May 15 and 16, six legal complaints have been filed, with plaintiffs alleging that the exchange failed to implement adequate security measures and mishandled its response to the breach.

2025-05-31T11:19:38,"IMF Reveals Huge Flaws in Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Plan Amid Power Crisis","The post IMF Reveals Huge Flaws in Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Plan Amid Power Crisis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pakistan wants to mine Bitcoin with 2,000 megawatts of power it barely has. The announcement, part of a broader strategy to attract crypto and AI firms, has triggered an immediate backlash from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and for good reason. As the country wrestles with severe energy shortages and ongoing bailout talks, the IMF is demanding urgent answers. According to Samaa , officials are now facing “stiff questions” about how legal – or even logical – this mining push really is. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” said one government official involved in the negotiations. Here’s what you should know. Pakistan’s Crypto Play Falls Flat The plan, unveiled alongside the debut of Pakistan’s first Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference, was meant to signal a pivot toward digital finance. But the optics don’t match the infrastructure. Pakistan’s power grid is notoriously unreliable, with high transmission losses and blackouts still common. Meanwhile, industrial electricity rates hover around $0.22 per kWh – nearly 10x what miners pay in Texas. At that rate, mining one Bitcoin in Pakistan would cost a staggering $132,000, compared to the global average of around $40,000-$50,000. Even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, “the model falls apart,” warns local engineer Sana Zakir. “These subsidies may not be sustainable. Pakistan’s agreements with the IMF explicitly discourage blanket energy subsidies.” A Big Bitcoin Bluff! To make matters worse, the IMF claims it wasn’t even consulted about the plan. The Fund has flagged legal ambiguities surrounding crypto in Pakistan, raising red flags over the PDAA – the newly formed Pakistan Digital Asset Authority set to oversee exchanges, DeFi platforms, and tokenization efforts. This is a fundamental red flag. All the Right Ideas, All the Wrong Execution Pakistan does have potential. At least one can argue that it does. Cheap labor, untapped solar and hydro resources, and regional demand could have positioned it well – if the groundwork were there. But right now, it’s not. This was not a strategic move. It was a chaotic attempt to ride a wave without learning how to swim in the kiddy pool. Unless Pakistan overhauls its infrastructure, energy pricing, and regulatory clarity, it risks turning a high-profile initiative into a self-inflicted crisis. It surely wouldn’t be the first time.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/imf-reveals-huge-flaws-in-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-plan-amid-power-crisis/,"BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|ZRX","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T11:04:11,"Tap, Pay, and Go: SpacePay’s NFC Integration Brings Crypto Payments to Any Smartphone","The post Tap, Pay, and Go: SpacePay’s NFC Integration Brings Crypto Payments to Any Smartphone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency was supposed to change how we pay for things. Yet here we are, years later, still pulling out credit cards at coffee shops while our crypto sits unused in digital wallets. SpacePay tackles this challenge with a payment platform that features a 0.5% transaction fee, works with over 325 crypto wallets, and provides instant fiat settlements for merchants. The London-based startup has already raised over $1 million during their ongoing presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. Crypto Payments Without the Technical Mess Ask any shop owner why they don’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll mention the complicated setup or expensive equipment. SpacePay cuts through this complexity with a simple solution that works with existing Android payment terminals. No expensive hardware needed. Just a quick software update. The NFC functionality allows customers to simply tap their smartphones against payment terminals, just like contactless credit cards. This familiar gesture makes crypto payments feel natural and effortless. The system works with over 325 different cryptocurrency wallets. Whether you store crypto on a hardware wallet or keep everything on your phone, SpacePay processes the payment smoothly. This compatibility means customers can use what they already have instead of downloading another app. Protecting Merchants From Price Swings Here’s the nightmare that keeps businesses away from crypto: a customer pays with Bitcoin for a $100 purchase in the morning, but by afternoon, that payment is only worth $85 because the market crashed. SpacePay solves this with technology that protects merchants from volatility completely. When someone pays with Bitcoin, the business owner gets regular currency immediately. That $100 sale stays exactly $100 in their bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or soars five minutes later. The system freezes the exchange rate during the transaction. If Bitcoin’s price suddenly drops, SpacePay absorbs the difference instead of passing that risk to the merchant. Store owners don’t need to become crypto traders. They just see normal payments without the crypto drama. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Slashing Payment Costs That Hurt Small Businesses Credit card processing fees take between 2.5% and 3.5% from every transaction. Consider a local bookstore doing $30,000 in monthly sales. With traditional payment systems, they’re paying roughly $900 each month in processing fees. SpacePay changes this with their 0.5% transaction fee. That same bookstore would only pay $150 monthly – keeping an extra $750 every month. Over a year, that’s $9,000 staying in the business instead of going to payment processors. These savings come from eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Traditional systems bounce your money between multiple companies before reaching the merchant days later. SpacePay creates a direct path using blockchain technology, which maintains security while cutting excessive fees. Making Crypto Practical for Daily Life The technology behind SpacePay might be sophisticated, but the user experience is refreshingly simple. Most payment systems process transactions like cars moving through a single-lane tunnel – checking one thing at a time before moving to the next step. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. Think of it like having multiple security guards checking different aspects of an ID simultaneously. SpacePay checks wallet details, crypto balances, merchant info, and exchange rates all at once. This parallel processing explains why Bitcoin payments complete in seconds rather than minutes. Nobody stands around awkwardly waiting for confirmations. The transaction happens fast enough that it feels like any other payment method. Every transaction gets permanently recorded on the blockchain. It creates tamper-proof records protected by serious encryption. This distributed approach not only speeds things up but makes the entire system more secure than traditional payment methods. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes. Customers and merchants just see a clean, simple payment experience that works reliably every time. No technical knowledge required on either side of the transaction. The really clever part is how SpacePay handles the conversion from crypto to regular money. Most systems make this feel like two separate steps – first the crypto payment, then the conversion. SpacePay makes it feel like one smooth transaction where Bitcoin goes in and dollars come out seamlessly. Visit SpacePay Presale Real-World Adoption That Actually Works SpacePay isn’t building a solution for some theoretical future. They’re addressing real problems that prevent Bitcoin from being useful today. The platform already has plans to roll out across 4.5 million Android-based payment terminals in nine countries. This ambitious expansion works because SpacePay doesn’t force businesses to replace equipment they already own. The software-update approach means widespread adoption becomes possible without massive infrastructure investments. Early merchants testing the system report positive experiences. They appreciate the lower fees, instant settlements, and the fact that accepting Bitcoin doesn’t require becoming crypto experts. Customers enjoy finally being able to spend their digital assets at regular businesses without jumping through hoops. The $SPY token powers this ecosystem with features that extend beyond simple payments. Token holders receive monthly loyalty rewards, voting rights on platform decisions, and revenue sharing from transaction fees. This community-driven approach creates incentives for everyone to want SpacePay to succeed. How to Join the SpacePay Presale For those interested in joining the SpacePay ecosystem, the ongoing presale offers an entry point. Visit SpacePay’s official website and connect your crypto wallet to participate. The platform accepts various payment methods including ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDT, USDC, and traditional bank cards.

2025-05-31T11:00:32,"Bitcoin Nears Crucial 4H MA 200 – Can Bulls Step In?","Bitcoin is facing a critical technical and psychological test after falling over 7% from its all-time high near $112,000. The retracement comes amid a wave of renewed global uncertainty, as the US and China reignite tariff battles, shaking investor confidence and injecting volatility into financial markets. Despite the macro headwinds, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a hedge against systemic risk and political instability. The current consolidation places Bitcoin just above $105,000, a level that many analysts are watching closely. According to top analyst Big Cheds, BTC is now approaching the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA), a historically significant dynamic support during previous bull cycles. A bounce from this level could confirm ongoing bullish momentum, while a failure to hold it might expose the market to further downside and trigger a broader risk-off move across crypto. With altcoins also experiencing pressure, market participants are closely monitoring BTC’s next move to gauge broader sentiment. If bulls manage to defend key support and reclaim higher levels , the uptrend could resume. However, the coming days will be crucial, as Bitcoin navigates between technical structure, macroeconomic stress, and market-wide liquidity shifts. Bitcoin Tests Support As Market Awaits Directional Break Bitcoin is now testing a critical demand zone around the $103,000 level, following a sharp rejection from the $112,000 all-time high. After several failed breakout attempts in recent days, momentum has shifted, and BTC is pulling back amid a broader market cooldown. The move has increased short-term uncertainty, but the price still remains within a high-timeframe bullish structure. Macroeconomic tensions continue to shape the crypto landscape, with rising US Treasury yields pointing to deeper systemic stress. Investors are navigating heightened volatility as global markets react to ongoing US-China trade disputes and mixed economic signals. Despite this, Bitcoin’s pullback may present a healthy consolidation phase rather than a trend reversal, provided bulls defend critical support levels. Cheds highlights that Bitcoin is fast approaching the 4-hour 200 moving average, currently near $102,500. This is a historically reliable dynamic support level that has marked key reversal points in previous bull phases. A successful defense of this level could signal the end of the retracement and initiate the next leg higher. However, a breakdown below it could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $98K–$100K zone. As BTC hovers near support, the coming sessions will be decisive. Holding above the 4H MA 200 could reignite bullish sentiment and restore upward momentum, while failure to do so may shift focus toward more defensive trading setups across the crypto market. BTC Tests Daily Support Zone After 7% Retracement Bitcoin is now trading near $103,300, testing the key support level marked by the previous range high at $103,600. After reaching a new all-time high at $112,000 earlier this week, BTC has pulled back over 7%, triggering a wave of uncertainty across the market. This support zone aligns with the 34-day EMA at $102,548, making it a pivotal area to watch for bulls aiming to regain momentum. The chart shows BTC holding a strong uptrend structure despite the recent decline. Volume has increased slightly on this drop, suggesting some profit-taking but not yet panic selling. Price is still trading above all major daily moving averages, including the 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which remain upward-sloping—a signal that long-term trend structure is intact. A bounce from current levels would confirm $103,600 as a new support floor and open the door for another attempt to reclaim the $109,300 resistance. However, if bears break below this zone, downside risk increases with the next major demand area around $98,000. With macroeconomic stress building and Bitcoin’s previous rally overextended, consolidation at this level may be necessary before the next leg up.

2025-05-31T10:58:25,"Digital Real Estate Rush: Bitcoin Solaris’s Fixed 21 Million Supply Creates Same Scarcity That Drove BTC News Headlines in 2013","The post Digital Real Estate Rush: Bitcoin Solaris’s Fixed 21 Million Supply Creates Same Scarcity That Drove BTC News Headlines in 2013 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the early 2010s, Bitcoin captured headlines because a limited group of users understood one thing early: fixed supply and functional access change everything. Today, Bitcoin Solaris is generating similar buzz from the deliberate replication of Bitcoin’s earliest value drivers — a capped supply, real distribution mechanics, and a technologically sound mining system accessible to anyone with a smartphone. As Bitcoin reached the mainstream, that window closed. Early buyers were rewarded not by luck, but by their timing against a hard-coded ceiling. That model isn’t coming back for BTC — but Bitcoin Solaris is proving that the conditions can exist again, for a limited time, under a modern framework. Bitcoin’s Scarcity, Rebooted Bitcoin Solaris follows the same scarcity-driven economics that made Bitcoin historically powerful: a fixed total supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens. But unlike Bitcoin in its infancy, this time the infrastructure is already prepared for adoption. Instead of clunky miners and command-line wallets, Bitcoin Solaris integrates directly with mobile devices. The model distributes value without diluting it. There are no hidden inflation mechanics, no token burns, and no emissions loopholes. Once the 21 million are distributed, that’s it. This architectural certainty is rare in a market dominated by variable token models, dynamic supply contracts, and investor dilution. And while Bitcoin took nearly a decade to enter retail awareness, Bitcoin Solaris has onboarded over 11,000 users in advance of its Nova App rollout — a user base ready to participate in the mobile mining economy the moment it activates. Helios Architecture: Scalability Without Compromise Bitcoin Solaris’s dual-layer blockchain combines a PoS + PoC base layer with a high-speed Solaris Layer, built on a hybrid of Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. The result is a decentralized system capable of 10,000+ transactions per second, two-second finality, and energy efficiency exceeding 99.95% compared to Bitcoin’s original mining framework. This architecture enables smartphone-level mining and massive user onboarding without the bottlenecks seen in Ethereum or Solana. It also ensures that BTC-S is not only scarce, but sustainably distributed at scale. For retail investors and early adopters, this creates a structural advantage that institutional models and legacy blockchains simply don’t offer. Presale Mechanics and Strategic Positioning Bitcoin Solaris is currently in presale phase 5, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. This marks the final stage before centralized exchange listings, where the token is expected to list at 20 USDT. Of the full 21 million supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) have been reserved for the entire presale allocation. But unlike other projects, this isn’t just a discounted sale. It’s an opportunity to acquire tokens before mining difficulty scales, before Nova App competition grows, and before centralized liquidity begins shaping price discovery. Presale participants are securing both financial leverage and early protocol presence. This phase won’t last indefinitely. As token demand rises in anticipation of live mining and CEX onboarding, each subsequent participant enters at higher pricing and higher competition levels. Audited and Verified for Market Readiness Bitcoin Solaris has completed multiple layers of third-party verification. A full Cyberscope audit reviewed the project’s smart contracts and consensus code. A Freshcoins audit validated the mobile mining infrastructure, and KYC verification confirmed the team’s identity and operational transparency. This level of diligence is rare in presale environments and offers retail participants an additional layer of confidence in an ecosystem already engineered for clarity. Crypto analyst Crypto Chester recently highlighted Bitcoin Solaris’s supply model as “the closest parallel to Bitcoin’s original scarcity framework since 2013,” pointing out how user access is now aligned with functionality — not just trading volume. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fixed supply made it iconic. Bitcoin Solaris brings that same principle to a network built for 2025 — not 2009. It doesn’t just replicate Bitcoin’s scarcity. It upgrades the delivery system, distributes rewards via mobile access, and ensures participation from over 11,000 users before exchange listings begin. With Phase 5 priced at 5 USDT and a ceiling of 21 million tokens, the window is open — but it’s not wide. Supply will run out. Listings will shift pricing. The only variable left is timing.

2025-05-31T10:46:57,"Stablecoins dominate the conversation at Bitcoin 2025","Stablecoins were the headline story at Bitcoin 2025 this week in Las Vegas, not Bitcoin. The three-day event, which pulled in a crowd of 35,000, saw major political names and crypto executives focusing heavily on dollar-pegged tokens, not the coin that started it all. According to CNBC, what dominated the stage was a growing political alliance pushing legislation to bring stablecoins into the core of US financial power. Vice President JD Vance showed up to deliver a full public endorsement of the space, becoming the first VP to speak directly to Bitcoiners. “I think it’s wrong, actually, to call this just a conference,” JD told attendees. “This is a movement. And I’m proud to stand with you.” JV also made it clear the White House now sees stablecoins as an asset. “We do not think that stablecoins threaten the integrity of the US dollar. Quite the opposite,” he said. “We view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.” Congress pushes stablecoin bill as GOP sets deadline Bo Hines, who runs the president’s Digital Assets Council, said stablecoin rails are being streamlined to secure the US dollar’s dominance “for decades to come.” Bo told CNBC the White House believes this could unlock trillions of dollars in demand for American debt from global buyers. The entire playbook is tied to a new bill, the GENIUS Act, now heading to the floor of the US Senate. Senator Cynthia Lummis told the crowd that a deal had been reached after weeks of negotiations with Democrats. “We think we have a final deal,” Cynthia said. “If we can get this passed, this will be the first piece of digital asset legislation to pass the US Senate.” A cloture vote is expected Monday. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer praised Senator Bill Hagerty for speeding up what he called a “calcified” Senate and said Republicans want to get both the stablecoin and market structure bills to President Donald Trump’s desk before August recess. “The president promised this,” Tom said. “We want it done now.” Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, said the stablecoin bill will reach the House Financial Services Committee by July. Bryan said it would allow issuers to buy US Treasuries at a crucial moment. “It enshrines the US dollar in our dominant role as the world’s reserve currency,” he said. Bryan also dismissed Democratic efforts to add an amendment that would block government officials from benefiting from stablecoin companies. That clause was reportedly aimed at the Trump family, who are linked to World Liberty Financial, the firm behind the new USD1 token. Tether expands while Wall Street builds competition The biggest issuer in the stablecoin space right now is Tether, and its CEO Paolo Ardoino said the next big use case will come from commodity traders, not banks. Paolo said Tether is ready for what’s next. “All the traditional financial firms will create stablecoins that will be offered to their existing customers,” he told CNBC. But he argued those firms are boxed in by their own high-fee business models. Instead of chasing wealthy users, Paolo said Tether is focusing on reaching the global majority who don’t have access to banks. “Many of our competitors say, ‘Oh, Tether is serving this niche of the unbanked.’ Half of the population of the world should not be called a niche,” he said. While Paolo was onstage in Vegas, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are in early talks to launch a joint digital dollar to compete directly with Tether. The battle between legacy finance and crypto-native firms is now on-chain. Kraken CEO Dave Ripley, who’s been in private talks with lawmakers, told CNBC the bill is critical to bringing big banks and brokers into the space. But he said there are still issues to resolve, like whether users can earn yield and what rules apply to politicians investing in stablecoin companies. “Crypto is all about individuals,” Dave said. “Let’s bring the value to them.” There’s also a loud change happening at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency once seen as the crypto world’s biggest problem. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said change was overdue. “For many years now, I’ve been complaining about the fact that the commission has not taken proactive steps to provide clarity,” Hester said. “Now finally, we’re at a place where we can do that.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-2025-stablecoins-overshadowed-btc/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT","News|BTC|USDC|USDT",cryptocompare

As of press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $103,555, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen a modest correction of about 0.14%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Turning to price predictions, Finbold consulted both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for insights into how the asset will likely trade by June 30. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price For starters, ChatGPT suggested that Bitcoin’s strong momentum could continue into the next month, with a base-case prediction of $118,000 by June 30, 2025. The model highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience at this level, backed by the possibility of renewed bullish sentiment. ChatGPT also noted that historical seasonality offers mixed clues, as June has seen pre-summer rallies and notable corrections in past years. At the same time, the broader macroeconomic environment could also play a key role. If global liquidity conditions improve or central banks cut rates, Bitcoin might benefit from increased capital inflows. The model also pointed to key technical resistance levels expected between $110,000 and $120,000, but if Bitcoin breaks through, a price as high as $130,000 becomes plausible. On the flip side, should Bitcoin face resistance or market sentiment sour, it could retreat to $98,000. ChatGPT estimates there’s a 65% chance that Bitcoin will finish June above $110,000, though breaking $130,000 would likely require a major bullish catalyst. Bitcoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok offered a more tempered outlook. Based on Bitcoin’s current price and historical volatility, Grok predicts that Bitcoin will trade around $108,000 by June 30. This assumes continued bullish sentiment supported by institutional inflows and favorable regulatory developments. However, Grok also pointed out that resistance near $110,000 could temper the rally, with a plausible range between $105,000 and $112,000. A pullback to around $95,000 is possible if Bitcoin’s momentum stalls. In summary, both AI models suggest Bitcoin is likely to remain above the $100,000 mark by the end of June 2025, with the potential to break higher if favorable conditions emerge. Indeed, as Bitcoin enters June, the asset is witnessing increased institutional demand , with several entities adding the asset to their treasuries. To this end, some analysts believe the move will likely create a supply shock and drive the asset’s price higher.

2025-05-31T10:35:40,"Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation","The post Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Public companies have accumulated more Bitcoin than U.S. spot ETFs over the past three quarters, signaling long-term strategic adoption. MicroStrategy leads with 580,250 BTC as corporate holdings reach 757,593 BTC, marking a structural shift in Bitcoin ownership dynamics. Publicly traded companies are steadily becoming major players in Bitcoin accumulation, surpassing even spot ETFs in net additions over recent quarters. Unlike the highly reactive nature of ETF flows, these corporate purchases are long-term, often held on balance sheets as strategic assets. Public Companies Are Buying More BTC Than ETFs According to a post by respected crypto analyst Ecoinometrics , public companies have added more Bitcoin to their balance sheets over the past three quarters than U.S. spot ETFs. These sustained purchases suggest a trend of structural demand, as corporate treasuries continue accumulating BTC with a long-term outlook. How Much Bitcoin Do Public Companies Hold? Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies now hold 757,593 BTC , valued at approximately $78.67 billion , representing 3.6% of the total BTC supply . Top 5 Public BTC Holders (by Market Cap): MicroStrategy : 580,250 BTC (~$60.25B) Marathon Digital Holdings : 48,237 BTC (~$5B) Riot Platforms : 19,211 BTC (~$1.99B) CleanSpark : 12,101 BTC (~$1.26B) Tesla : 11,509 BTC (~$1.19B) MicroStrategy remains the leader, purchasing an additional 133,988 BTC this year alone, with 26,695 BTC added in just the last month. Other notable increases in 2025 include: Marathon : +7,802 BTC Riot : +2,483 BTC CleanSpark : +2,804 BTC Tesla : +1,789 BTC These figures reflect growing institutional confidence in BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Spot ETF Holdings: Bigger, But More Volatile While public companies lead in new accumulation, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still hold more overall BTC. The top 12 ETFs combined hold 1,211,938 BTC , valued at around $125.85 billion , accounting for 5.77% of total BTC supply. Top 5 Spot Bitcoin ETFs: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) : 664,954.7 BTC (~$69.05B) Fidelity Wise Origin (FBTC) : 198,291 BTC (~$20.59B) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) : 186,706.1 BTC (~$19.39B) ARK 21Shares (ARKB) : 47,152.2 BTC (~$4.9B) Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) : 43,690.1 BTC (~$4.54B) However, ETF flows have been more mixed this year: IBIT : +113,036.1 BTC FBTC : -2,872 BTC GBTC : -18,692.8 BTC ARKB : +545.1 BTC Mini Trust : +5,677.2 BTC These fluctuations highlight the more reactive nature of ETFs compared to corporate treasury strategies. Why Corporate BTC Accumulation Matters Unlike ETFs that may adjust holdings based on short-term investor sentiment, corporations typically treat Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. This difference matters: ETFs = Liquidity-driven, reactive to market trends Public Companies = Sticky, long-term holders The result: corporate accumulation gradually removes BTC from circulation, creating structural demand that can support long-term price growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Bitcoin Market Snapshot Here’s how Bitcoin has performed recently: Timeframe Price Change Last 6 Months +7.52% Year-to-Date +11.1% Last 30 Days +8.99% Last 14 Days +0.25% Last 7 Days -4.09% Last 24 Hours -1.49% Final Thoughts As public companies continue to increase their BTC holdings quietly but consistently, their role in shaping Bitcoin’s long-term market structure is becoming more significant. These moves may not generate the daily headlines that ETF launches do—but they represent a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s role as a treasury asset. The next time volatility strikes, it might be the public companies—not ETFs—that provide the bedrock of long-term support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T10:20:34,"XRP Set for Big Gains? Experts Predict $10 to $23 Rally by Year-End","The post XRP Set for Big Gains? Experts Predict $10 to $23 Rally by Year-End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP could be gearing up for a major breakout. Experts predict that XRP could go as high as $10 by the year’s end. In an interview with Altcoin Daily , crypto analyst George Tung, the founder of CryptosRUs, said that he sees XRP hitting between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. He pointed to XRP’s ability to survive multiple market cycles and its solid fundamentals as the key reasons for his bold prediction. $8–$10 Targets Just the Start? Tung called the $8-$10 a conservative estimate for XRP. The rising institutional interest with several XRP ETFs in the making, are the key catalysts, he says. If the ETFs are approved, it could unlock massive demand and push XRP much higher in this cycle. XRP’s strong fundamentals make it a safer bet for new investors, compared to the hype driven meme-coins. In a broader market outlook, he expects Bitcoin to climb 1.5x to 2x, Ethereum 3x to 4x, and sees XRP’s 4x to 5x potential as realistic, especially if market sentiment improves and altcoin liquidity returns. He predicts Bitcoin could peak between $200K and $300K this cycle. Focus on Strong Projects, Limit Risky Bets He was asked if $1000 could be turned to $100,000 by year-end, to which Tung warned against chasing huge gains without understanding the risks. While memecoins like Pepe have made headlines, Tung noted that those big wins are rare now. He recommends users to put most of their money into solid, proven projects and allot just 5-10% for risky plays like memecoin. Bullish Predictions Virtual Bacon sees a buying opportunity for XRP, but only if it drops 20% or more compared to Bitcoin. He says this could play out in two ways: XRP falls while Bitcoin stays steady, or Bitcoin pumps and XRP lags. Both cases could push XRP into a strong value range. He calls it a classic mid-cycle pattern that often surprises the market. Davinci Jeremie, who said “XRP is going to zero”, now sees strong institutional interest and believes it could hit $24. XRP researcher SMQKE thinks XRP could beat Ethereum this year and go up to at least $6. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, expects XRP to rise to $13 or even $22, based on strong signs from its yearly price chart. Dark Defender says XRP is making a new pattern on the weekly chart that could push it up to $18.22 to $23.20 soon. He called $5.85 a key mid-level to watch and said this move matches their previous targets and a pattern from November 2024. He also shared that there may be some resistance along the way.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-set-for-big-gains-experts-predict-10-to-23-rally-by-year-end/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-05-31T10:00:00,"For Everyone Who Said ‘I Should Have Bought Bitcoin Earlier’ – Bitcoin Solaris is Your Time Machine Moment","You’ve heard the stories. The early believers who bought Bitcoin at $0.10 and watched it soar to thousands. Today, that moment seems like a legend—something that passed you by. But what if you had a second chance? What if you could go back in time… and this time, do it right? A growing number of crypto veterans believe that moment is here again, just in a new form. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and it’s quietly becoming one of the most serious contenders for the next generational wealth wave. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just a Coin Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s building on its core—scarcity, decentralization, and security—but reshaping it for scalability, sustainability, and utility. Imagine Bitcoin if it was launched today, designed for mobile-first users, equipped with smart contract functionality, and cross-chain compatibility baked in from day one. With a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, BTC-S mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity but adds layers of innovation that make it usable in today’s fast-paced DeFi world. From the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which will allow users to mine directly from mobile phones , to enterprise-ready smart contracts, BTC-S is gearing up to dominate across sectors. How Bitcoin Solaris Delivers at Lightning Speed Unlike the original Bitcoin network, which can struggle under transaction load, Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) for decentralization and security. The Solaris Layer, on the other hand, uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for rapid speed and minimal energy use. Performance Highlights: Base Layer: Up to 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer: Up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Smart contracts written in Rust Uses Solana’s tooling and Proof-of-History to accelerate adoption And yes—the Solaris Nova app will allow anyone with a smartphone to participate in mobile mining, creating daily income from something already in your hand. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a structured tokenomics model that reflects both fairness and forward-thinking strategy. 66.66% for mining rewards over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% each for development, community, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This balanced approach ensures long-term community alignment while incentivizing adoption and growth at every stage. Presale Frenzy: The Final Hours of This Phase Today marks the last day of the current presale phase, with BTC-S still priced at just $5 . With a launch price of $20, early backers are looking at a potential 1,900% return. The presale is exploding—over 11,000 unique users have already joined, raising more than $1.8 million. Why the buzz? Because this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market, with less than 9 weeks left until launch. Momentum is building—and fast. And if you want to stay plugged in? The project is active across platforms like Telegram and X , where real-time updates and conversations are heating up. A Word on Trust and Community Validation Security is critical. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone dual smart contract audits, one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins . In addition, a full KYC verification has been completed, increasing investor confidence as the ecosystem grows. In addition, crypto enthusiasts are already calling this “the one they won’t miss again.” A detailed review by Crypto Volt breaks down exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from investors, influencers, and analysts alike. And judging by the community energy, this could be just the beginning. Conclusion: You Wished for a Do-Over—Now It’s Here Bitcoin at ten cents felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. But every cycle brings new chances to those who are watching closely. Bitcoin Solaris offers more than a coin—it offers a complete, scalable, and decentralized platform primed for growth. This might just be your time machine moment.

2025-05-31T09:46:36,"Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. In crypto and web3, money can be created, lost, or multiplied within seconds. It’s the polar opposite of old money, which grew slowly, accruing value over years or even decades. Crypto accelerates that, posting double-digit moves before TradFi wakes up and has breakfast. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion This hyper-cycle of onchain value creation—and eradication—compels us to reconsider what money truly is and how it functions in a decentralized future. While traditional money was based on nation-states and central banks, web3 money is founded on code, consensus, and community belief. It writes its own rules—and then forces the rest of the world to follow along. Not because they have to, but because if they don’t, they risk being left behind. It’s a case of innovate or die. And right now, web3 is doing most of the innovating as it reimagines what money is capable of achieving—and who it achieves it for. In this new environment, capital is not just capital: it represents culture, software, and storytelling. Value is digital, 24/7 tradable, and accessible to everyone, not just the suits in their glass towers. The future of finance is being rapidly built before our eyes, and mastering this transformation calls for rewriting the rulebook on what money means. A generation of digital natives is growing up, to whom money doesn’t mean checking accounts and 401 Ks—it means self-custodied stablecoins, yield-producing assets, and collectibles that can command eye-watering prices. Navigating this future calls for viewing money through five new perspectives. Reimagining money First, money has become a networked belief. In crypto, money is no longer issued by governments but created through consensus. Bitcoin ( BTC ) represents trust in a limited supply and decentralization, while Ethereum ( ETH ) shows faith in programmable agreements. Even memecoins demonstrate that stories, viral spread, and community engagement can generate market value without practical utility. In this system, value grows with belief. Money becomes a network effect: a shared idea we all participate in. We know why Bitcoin is valuable: because it’s hard to obtain, has a fixed supply, and is secured by the world’s largest decentralized network. But precious as these attributes are, Bitcoin’s value ultimately comes down to a shared, networked belief. We believe it is precious, and hundreds of millions of others share our conviction, so Number Go Up. Second, money functions as infrastructure rather than status. In traditional finance, wealth is the goal. In web3, it serves as a tool to build ecosystems, coordinate communities, and motivate action. Tokens fund development. DAOs direct capital toward common goals. NFTs serve as programmable access layers, not just collectibles. Here, money works as infrastructure: it is a tool, not a trophy. It’s the means, not the endgame. It’s often said that money doesn’t buy happiness—merely freedom of choice. What is crypto if not the ultimate embodiment of that concept? Freedom to build; freedom to collaborate; freedom to buy and sell anything, any time, to anyone. Third, money exists as a transparent flow. Blockchain technology makes every transaction visible. Unlike traditional systems hidden behind intermediaries, on-chain finance transforms money into traceable, verifiable movement. This creates a new dynamic: behavior becomes observable, and economic patterns become public. It makes us think about not just how money moves, but why. The important question becomes: What does this movement reveal about our true values? The psychology of money Fourth, money operates as a temporal illusion. Crypto’s volatility shows an important truth: value is not fixed; it’s constructed. In web3, fortunes appear or disappear in minutes. This volatility affects both finances and psychology. It teaches us that money does not equal security but represents a constantly changing narrative. This instability requires humility, not exaggeration. Quick profits may come easily, but their real cost often becomes apparent later. As the bitcoiners’ mantra goes, “Stay humble and stack sats.” In other words, don’t flaunt your wealth: be grateful for what you’ve got and keep quietly adding to it if your conviction in its value remains undiminished. Finally, money functions as a moral code. Programmable money allows us to embed values directly into code. Incentive structures can reward transparency, collaboration, environmental protection, or long-term contribution, not just speculation. This means web3 gives us the unique opportunity to design moral money—money that reflects shared principles, not just market forces. In the web3 era, money isn’t merely what you possess: it’s what you help create. It reflects collective belief, functions as a programmable social layer, and serves as a tool that can either strengthen or weaken the values we care about. This is why astute web3 VCs invest not only in technical innovation but in value-aligned ecosystems. Because if we can redesign financial infrastructure, we also have the responsibility to ask: what kind of world should it serve? Let’s not just earn money. Let’s reimagine it.

2025-05-31T09:45:22,"XRP Big Holder Says He Won’t Sell Until This Price","Edoardo Farina, a cryptocurrency proponent and founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has laid out a personal plan for managing his XRP holdings. This plan contrasts with the short-term strategies followed by many investors. Rather than seeking immediate returns, Farina aims to retain most of his position until the token’s value reaches triple-digit territory. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, and while this is much lower than Farina’s long-term objective, he remains focused on future milestones, with his approach centered on value retention, selective profit-taking, and long-term utility through decentralized finance. A Milestone to Celebrate Growth Farina does not intend to sell a substantial portion of his XRP, even when the token reaches higher valuations. He has previously warned community members not to sell their tokens at current levels and explained in his video that his first small sale will occur when the asset hits $10, a point he considers suitable for locking in a minor percentage of gains. According to him, this step is not an exit but rather a way to celebrate progress and redirect some funds into real estate investments, particularly in Greece, where he has already been active with proceeds from other cryptocurrencies. He also shared how his holdings are managed. The vast majority of his XRP is stored offline in cold wallets, with only a small portion held on exchanges for liquidity purposes. He recently drew attention to the Mt. Gox collapse that ruined the lives of many Bitcoin holders and warned XRP holders to move their tokens off centralized exchanges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Taking Profit at Future Price Levels Farina revealed that he would sell some tokens at $50, but noted that the scale would be modest. The next target is $100 , and Farina has explained that selling just 1,000 tokens at this price would bring in $100,000. Farina argued that withdrawing the original capital investment is a sound practice in risk management, but insisted that the majority of his tokens will not be sold. A Better Option than Selling Farina’s ultimate goal does not involve liquidation but rather participation in lending opportunities once the legal framework for XRP becomes more defined. He believes that lending XRP through regulated platforms will allow investors to earn yield in stablecoins, fiat currencies, or even XRP itself. Other experts have also advocated for this approach , as they expect large-scale institutional adoption once all regulatory issues are resolved. While some experts believe XRP may not hit $100 until the next decade, Farina remains unfazed, emphasizing long-term utility and passive income potential. He advises strategic selling, not reacting to short-term price shifts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-05-31T09:38:59,"Nigel Farage Vows Pro-Crypto Bill, Bitcoin Reserve If Elected UK PM","Key Takeaways: Nigel Farage pledged to pass a pro-crypto bill cutting taxes and creating a Bitcoin reserve if elected UK prime minister. The bill would also ban banks from denying services to crypto users, addressing concerns over “debanking.” The UK plans to enforce mandatory crypto trade reporting from January 2026 to boost tax compliance. Nigel Farage, leader of Britain’s Reform Party, has thrown his full backing behind cryptocurrency, unveiling an ambitious pro-crypto legislative plan at this year’s Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Taking the stage on Thursday , Farage promised that if elected prime minister in the UK’s next general election, scheduled for 2029, his government would champion crypto-friendly reforms. Waving a draft of the proposed “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” Farage declared, “We will campaign for this and we will put it in place when we win the next general election… Bring crypto and digital assets in from the cold.” UK Bill Proposes 10% Crypto Tax The proposed bill would significantly lower capital gains tax on crypto from the current 24% to 10%, mandate that the Bank of England create a Bitcoin reserve, and prohibit banks from denying services to individuals or businesses based on their crypto-related activities. The practice of so-called “debanking” has become a flashpoint in both political and crypto circles. Farage himself has claimed he was denied bank accounts for political reasons, a grievance he leveraged to connect with the conference’s audience. “I went to 10 banks, all of whom refused me an account,” Farage told the crowd. “No wonder so many people are going for Bitcoin—because they can’t close you down, and that is the ultimate freedom.” Farage is no stranger to controversy. He previously led UKIP, the driving force behind Brexit, and has long been a polarizing figure in British politics. The Reform Party, his current platform, has faced its own accusations of racism, which party leaders have denied. On Thursday, Farage also announced that the Reform Party now accepts crypto donations via its website, supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC). Let’s get the British economy into the 21st century. Read Reform UK’s Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill. https://t.co/5QytUV1p1V pic.twitter.com/pfqdAxhHPe — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) May 30, 2025 The party’s pro-crypto push aligns with a growing global trend among right-wing parties embracing digital assets. In recent years, politicians in the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina have advanced similar initiatives, linking crypto’s decentralization ethos with broader anti-establishment narratives. Farage closed his speech by appealing to the conference audience, framing the Reform Party’s crypto-friendly stance as part of a larger fight for financial freedom. “It’s about freedom and control of your own money,” he said, “and that’s what we stand for.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-05-31T09:36:51,"Mounting Evidence of Ethereum’s Struggles: Volatility, ETF Losses, Weak Demand","Ether’s price has been struggling to break above the $2,750 resistance level, despite rising by over 44% this month. Now, several evidence point to the altcoin’s struggles throughout the 2023-25 cycle, which revealed both volatility and capital flow patterns that contrast sharply with prior cycles and competitor assets like Bitcoin and Solana. Ethereum Faces Significant Headwinds One of the most notable indicators is Ether’s realized volatility, which has compressed across cycles as the asset’s size grows, currently hovering around 80%, down from over 120% in earlier periods, according to Glassnode’s latest report . Typically, Ether’s 3-month realized volatility rises during bull markets and falls during bearish trends. However, this cycle has defied that pattern. In fact, after reaching 60% at the mid-2024 peak of roughly $4,000, realized volatility surprisingly climbed above 90% even as the price declined toward $1,500. This atypical increase in volatility amid falling prices signals increased market uncertainty and instability. Moreover, while the drawdown structure in this cycle generally aligns with the typical Ether bull market pattern – where corrections of 40% or more from local peaks are common – the key deviation lies in the absence of a fresh ATH price for the altcoin, unlike Bitcoin and Solana, both of which set new peaks in this cycle. This lack of a new high has been a disappointment for many investors who expected the world’s second-largest crypto asset to track more closely with its peers. Additionally, Ether’s downside price movements have been unusually volatile, with multiple drawdowns exceeding 40% and the current 2025 drawdown peaking at an unusually severe 65.4%. While previous cycles have seen similar or worse drawdowns, they tended to occur later in the cycle. As such, this early, steep correction suggests structural weaknesses unique to this period. In terms of capital inflows, the Realized Cap – a measure of the value of all Ether based on the price at which coins last moved – has increased by only 38% since the cycle low in January 2023, growing from $176 billion to $243 billion. This pales in comparison to the massive growth during the 2021 cycle, which saw more than a 1,000% increase. The relatively muted capital inflow of approximately $67 billion during this cycle underlines weaker liquidity support and helps explain the crypto asset’s subdued price performance. Supporting this narrative, trade activity on major centralized exchanges has mirrored these trends: spot volume, which peaked at $14.7 billion per day during the $4,000 price high in December 2024, plunged by roughly 80% to $2.9 billion per day. Though recent trading volumes have rebounded to $8.6 billion daily, spot volumes have yet to establish new cycle highs, as seen with previous cycles. Average ETH ETF investor Substantially Underwater The firm’s analysis further revealed that the average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately 21%. Net outflows from these ETFs have tended to accelerate whenever Ethereum’s spot price drops below the average cost basis, observed during important declines in August 2024 and again in January and March 2025. Despite initial excitement, the ETFs accounted for only around 1.5% of spot market trade volume at launch, pointing to a lukewarm reception. While this rose to over 2.5% in November 2024, it has since reverted back to 1.5%. While the current market conditions reveal mounting pressure for the crypto asset, certain market experts also predict that it could hit the $3,000 mark as early as June.

2025-05-31T09:31:12,"Crypto Bulls Rack up $600M Liquidations as Bitcoin Drops Under $104K","Crypto markets saw a wave of liquidations in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) prices slipped under $104,000, triggering over $600 million in forced closures of bullish futures positions to mark the highest losses since February. A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows. Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi. While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters . Trump’s move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations. The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day. Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/crypto-bulls-rack-up-600m-liquidations-as-bitcoin-drops-under-104k,"ASIA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL","Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T09:15:36,"Bitcoin Is Still in a Strong Bullish Trend Despite Losing Major Support Level, Says Trader – Here’s His Outlook","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) amid a recent correction. The trader pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is still in a “strong bullish trend” despite breaking below the $106,000 support level. According to the widely followed analyst and trader, Bitcoin is primed to “bounce” as there is strong support at around the $104,000 price level. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on Sherpa’s chart on the four-hour time frame, Bitcoin could fall lower to just above $103,000 and then trade sideways for a while in a consolidation zone. “Things look okay for now, I would expect more pokes around this area but the longer the time spent here, the better in my opinion. You want to see a good low form.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,841 at time of writing. Turning to Popcat ( POPCAT ), Sherpa says the memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem is one of the altcoins that is in “dangerous territory.” Based on Sherpa’s chart of POPCAT on the four-hour time frame, the memecoin is at risk of breaking a crucial support area after printing a bearish lower high setup. “Coins that were great before like POPCAT might have just made a lower high and could be breaking this last low. I’m not saying it won’t bounce but I’m much more cautious right now than two weeks ago.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X POPCAT is trading at $0.385 at time of writing, down by around 30% over the past week.

2025-05-31T09:08:28,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 31 May, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 31 May, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Hello again! If you thought May was going to close out quietly, think again. This past week has been chaotic – full of volatility, influence, and power plays. From sudden exchange bans to surprising legal reversals, the industry is being pushed – and pulled – by regulators across the globe. Thailand’s crackdown, the SEC’s unexpected move to drop charges, and growing political pressure in the U.S. are just a few signs that the industry is moving fast. But let’s take a step back to get you all caught up. Here’s the top stories that you might have missed + everything you need to know to go into June well prepared. Let’s begin. #1 Trump-Era Shift? SEC Walks Away from Binance Battle After nearly two years of headline-grabbing allegations, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The dismissal, filed with prejudice , means the regulator can’t reopen the case. The SEC simply said the decision was made “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter.” The move follows a 60-day pause and growing speculation about a regulatory tone shift under President Trump. Binance was originally accused of inflating volumes, misusing funds, and trading unregistered securities. Now? The case is closed with no admission of guilt. Binance, as expected, celebrated the win as did the larger crypto community. #2 Reform’s Farage Set to Make UK a Global Crypto Powerhouse Nigel Farage is betting big on Bitcoin AND the British ballot. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas , the Reform UK leader unveiled his party’s “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” promising to slash crypto capital gains tax to 10%, create a Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England, and outlaw banks from de-banking crypto users. “We are going to launch in Britain a crypto revolution,” he said, holding up the bill on stage. With crypto adoption soaring among young Brits, Farage says it’s time to catch up and he’s ready to lead that charge. #3 U.S. Lawmakers Launch CLARITY Act for Clear Crypto Rules Regulatory confusion has been a constant headache for the U.S. crypto industry but that may be about to change. On May 29, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act , aiming to draw clear lines around digital assets. Led by Rep. French Hill and supported by key figures like Tom Emmer, this bill wants to assign clear agency oversight and legal definitions to the crypto market. With areas like exchange registration and stablecoin rules on the table, it could bring much-needed certainty. If passed, the CLARITY Act might be the framework the U.S. has long lacked, giving both investors and innovators room to breathe. Can’t wait! #4 Trump Media to Join Bitcoin Billionaires’ Club President Donald Trump’s media startup, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is making a headline-grabbing move: it plans to pour $2.5 billion into bitcoin . The company, known for Truth Social and Truth+, announced it will fund the purchase by selling stock and convertible bonds. Devin Nunes, TMTG’s CEO and Trump ally, called bitcoin “an apex instrument of financial freedom” and said holding crypto will protect the company from “harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” This deal could soon put TMTG among the largest public corporate holders of bitcoin, showing how the Trump camp is doubling down on digital assets. #5 Thailand Cuts Off Five Unlicensed Crypto Giants Thailand is drawing the line! Starting June 28, five big-name centralized exchanges – Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT – will be cut off from the country’s internet . The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear: these platforms have been operating without proper registration. This is a protective move against crypto-related crimes and money laundering. The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society will enforce the ban, aiming to shield investors and clean up Thailand’s digital scene. #6 GameStop Buys Bitcoin, Loses Wall Street GameStop just made a $500 million bet on Bitcoin but investors are not on board. The move, intended to offset falling video game sales, triggered a 10% stock drop immediately, and a total plunge of 23%. While the company raised $1.5 billion to fund the pivot, critics aren’t sold. Many fear it’s like past mistakes, exposing GameStop to Bitcoin’s volatility. With store closures increasing and revenue declining, this shift has left the market asking: is this an act of desperation? #7 Solana to Hit $275? Standard Chartered Thinks So Standard Chartered dropped a bold forecast: Solana could hit $275 by end-2025 and stretch to $500 by 2029. The bank sees strength in Solana’s low-fee, high-volume use cases especially for financial and consumer apps. But there’s a catch: “achieving scale… could take time.” Despite leading meme coin activity, the bank notes $SOL looks cheap compared to its application revenue. Still, it expects Solana to underperform Ethereum near-term, with the $ETH/$SOL ratio rising to 17 by 2027, before correcting. Big potential, but the road’s not smooth. #8 Elon Musk Exits Trump Administration Elon Musk is out. The billionaire has officially stepped down from his role in the Trump administration, citing mounting frustration with the federal government’s resistance to cost-cutting reforms. As head of the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Service, Musk had aimed to rein in bloated spending but Trump’s sweeping budget plan pushed the deficit in the opposite direction. “Much worse than I realized,” he admitted, referring to the bureaucratic pushback. #9 New Stablecoin Bill May Lock In Dollar’s Digital Future The GENIUS Act recently cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, and it could redefine how the U.S. treats stablecoins and the dollar’s role in Web3. Backed by a 66–32 procedural vote, the bill demands 1:1 dollar reserves, strict audits, and federal licensing. Foresight Ventures says this would make the USD the “world’s digital settlement currency.” However, let’s hold further speculation till the final floor vote. #10 Cantor Fitzgerald Launches Bitcoin Fund Crypto cautious? This might be for you. Cantor Fitzgerald is launching a five-year Bitcoin fund – but here’s the twist: it’s hedged 1:1 with gold. Capture Bitcoin’s upside while using gold to lock in downside protection. “It’s designed to bring traditional investors into the ecosystem,” said Chairman Brandon Lutnick at Bitcoin 2025. Cantor’s previously teamed up with Maple and FalconX on BTC lending. Now, they’re taking a bigger swing at merging legacy finance with digital assets. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! SharpLink Doubles Down on ETH: In an interesting play, SharpLink Gaming shifted $425M into ETH and named Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman, marking one of the largest crypto treasury plays by a public company to date. NY Crypto Investor Held Hostage: Michael Carturan, an Italian crypto investor, was abducted in New York and held hostage for 17 days – all so his captors could get to his Bitcoin. The suspects have been caught, but the case is a reminder that holding crypto wealth isn’t just a digital risk anymore. Hong Kong Sets the Stage for Stablecoin Licensing: Hong Kong passed a law creating a formal license for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. This puts it among the first to offer clear rules, aiming to attract global crypto firms and boost its Web3 ambitions. SEC’s High-Profile June Summit: On June 5, the SEC will hold a conference highlighting how tokenization is transforming asset management and explore regulatory frameworks to support innovation in digital assets. TON’s New VP Hire Sparks Rally: TONcoin surged nearly 16% after Nikola Plecas, ex-Visa payments exec, joined TON Foundation as VP of Payments. His move ignited a sharp buying spree, pushing $TON past $3.25 with strong volume support. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead: With regulatory fog finally starting to clear, June looks set to bring some major moves. The GENIUS Act could reach final approval, potentially locking in the U.S. dollar’s digital future. Expect more institutional players to jump in as clearer rules and new products, like Cantor Fitzgerald’s gold-hedged Bitcoin fund, gain traction. Hong Kong is positioning itself as a stablecoin hub, attracting global crypto firms with fresh licensing laws and a clear regulatory framework. May’s mix of regulatory progress, growing adoption, and security challenges shows the market is volatile but also maturing fast. The crypto story keeps unfolding – we’ll bring you the headlines that matter. I’ll catch you next week, ready for what’s next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T09:05:30,"Bitcoin Shrinking Supply Sets Stage for Potential Price Surge","Bitcoin is entering a new phase of supply constraints that could significantly impact its price in the months ahead, according to Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at the digital asset banking group Sygnum. In a recent interview , Tischhauser pointed to what she calls a “supply shock” — a state in which Bitcoin’s liquid supply is dwindling while institutional demand continues to grow. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect,” Tischhauser said, estimating that for every $1 of net new demand, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could increase by $20 to $30. “We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the BTC spot ETFs or around the US elections,” she added. BTC’s supply, particularly the portion actively traded, has been declining over the past 18 months. Tischhauser attributes this trend to the rise of long-term holding structures such as institutional acquisition vehicles, including Strategy and Twenty One Capital. These entities are accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of holding it off exchanges, which reduces the amount available to meet new demand. A Perfect Storm of Bullish Drivers Tischhauser also pointed to macroeconomic and regulatory developments contributing to her bullish outlook. With rising concerns over inflation and increasing global interest in BTC as a deflationary store of value, the narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” is gaining traction. Additionally, regulatory clarity in the United States and other major economies is encouraging institutional participation, which could further reduce supply available for retail investors. Since April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have only seen four days of outflows , indicating steady institutional interest and capital inflow. This consistent demand, combined with structural supply constraints, sets up what some analysts believe could be a dramatic rally in the coming quarters. Healthy Pause in Bitcoin Price Nick Forster, founder of on-chain options protocol Derive, agrees that Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major move , but not before taking a breather. “The current price action suggests a phase of consolidation,” Forster said, calling it a “healthy pause” that allows the market to stabilize after reaching new highs. This period of sideways movement may also serve as a base for a strong upward push, with some analysts projecting BTC’s next peak between $200,000 and $300,000. As the supply continues to tighten and demand holds strong, the groundwork may already be in place for next bull run.

2025-05-31T09:01:19,"Dogecoin Dives 8%, Pepe Down 12% in Weekend Crypto Sell-Off","Cryptocurrencies started the weekend in red with Dogecoin (DOGE) down over 8% to lead losses among majors and Pepe (PEPE) shedding 12%. Bitcoin fell over 2% to under $104,000 and traded just over $103,600 in Asian afternoon hours Saturday, while the CoinDesk 20 index slumped 4.2% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 4%, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain (BNB), Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL showed losses between 2-5%. Cronos Network’s CRO was the only gainer in the top 100 tokens with a 12% on no immediate catalyst. Analysts attributed the downturn to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. “President Trump accused China on social media of violating the recent trade truce, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted in an interview that talks with Beijing had stalled.” The derivatives market also pointed to increasing investor caution. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is up 51% since April, while options have ballooned by 126%, according to data from Deribit. Whale wallets, which had been accumulating Bitcoin throughout the year, recently shifted to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges — a classic sign of profit-taking. ""Bitcoin’s local support looks solid around $103K for the coming days,"" Kuptsikevich said. However, with tariff headlines rattling markets and whales taking risk off, traders are bracing for more volatility, he added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/dogecoin-dives-8-pepe-down-12-in-weekend-crypto-sell-off,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|BNB","Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-31T08:00:40,"FTX Recovery Trust Begins $5 Billion Second Round of Creditor Payments","The FTX Recovery Trust has begun the second round of creditor repayments, releasing approximately $5 billion to eligible claimants as part of its ongoing effort to reimburse users affected by the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. This latest distribution , which started on May 30, targets claimants in both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have successfully completed all pre-distribution requirements. According to a May 28 announcement, the payout covers various categories of claims. Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims will receive a 72% reimbursement, while U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive 54%. Those holding Convenience Claims are being paid 120% of their entitled value, reflecting their priority in the distribution process. Meanwhile, General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are slated to receive a 61% distribution. Recipients should expect to see the funds in their accounts within one to two business days via the official partners, Kraken and BitGo . Crypto Markets Watch Closely for Liquidity Impact Market analysts and crypto traders are watching the reimbursements closely due to their potential impact on digital asset prices. The release of billions of dollars back into the hands of retail and institutional investors could introduce short-term volatility, particularly if large sums are sold or exchanged for other assets on public platforms. This round of repayments follows the initial February 18 distribution, in which $1.2 billion was sent to creditors with claims under $50,000 . At the time, Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan noted that a significant share of those funds might find their way back into crypto markets, either as reinvestment or liquidity provision. Critics Continue to Question Fairness of FTX Payout Structure Despite the substantial funds being returned, the reimbursement process has not been without controversy. A key concern lies in the court ruling that determined payouts would be based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy petition, rather than their current market prices. FTX creditor and vocal critic Sunil Kavuri highlighted that many creditors only received 10% to 25% of the current value of their crypto holdings due to the low market prices during the petition date. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $16,000—a fraction of its current value. Kavuri also raised alarm earlier this year over the exclusion of users in 163 countries , including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and Greenland, who are ineligible to receive reimbursement under the current plan. As the FTX Recovery Trust continues its efforts , the broader crypto community remains divided on whether justice has truly been served.

2025-05-31T08:00:22,"Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","The post Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of Hedera crypto is $ 0.16354466 . Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Projection 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.16354466 -6.39% Market Cap. $ 6,908,087,254.9777 Trading Volume. $ 222,167,822.5383 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 The external factors, like Trump’s tariff threat , have pushed the HBAR price into a consistent decline and have recently taken a strong rejection from the 200-day EMA band . Since mid-May, the HBAR crypto has shattered nearly 30%, coming from $0.233 to $0.162. Adding more fuel to the fire, the intraday sell pressure of 10% has broken the previous swing low of $0.170. On the daily chart, it is aiming for a decline towards retesting its critical support of $0.139, which also aligns with Q4 2024 momentum-based high volume profile level. This high volume profile showed strength in Q2 2025’s April month, where a recovery of over 80% from $0.125 to $0.228 was observed. This time, HABR approaching this level is critical, as it has become a “make or break level. If bullish forces step in again as seen last month, then a rally could spark, then there is a higher chance for its price to clear $0.401, and reach $0.750 by the 2025 year-end. But if the support has been weakened from a previous retest, then its break would be fearsome, which could even push HBAR price to the $0.072 level in a fast-paced momentum, as displayed in Q4 when bulls were in command. Unlike its price action, the internal fundamental factors are on the optimistic side. Its efforts have been reflected in significant progress in its ecosystem. In 2025, it introduced the first Hedera-native hardware wallet, Citadel, and AI-powered Hedera Agent Kit, allowing users to create tokens, reducing technical barriers. Another strong project is set to launch in Q3 2025, named HashSphere, a private, permissioned blockchain for highly regulated industries like payment providers and asset managers. To facilitate secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins while ensuring regulatory compliance. Even in order to streamline their work, on May 15, 2025, Hedera rebranded, renaming the HBAR Foundation to the “Hedera Foundation” and the Hedera Governing Council to the “Hedera Council.” Overall, the internal factors suggest that optimism is not so shallow, right now, and we can see some big moves in 2025, if all things are aligned well. But, still, the external factors highlight great caution for market participants.

According to reports, over 4.9 billion shareholders voted against the move, with about 8.9 million shares absent, and over 205 million non-votes. The move makes Meta Platforms the latest big tech firm to consider a shareholder push to add Bitcoin to its treasury following the previous push by Microsoft some months ago. However, just like this move, it ended in disappointment after shareholders voted to reject the proposal citing concerns about volatility. According to reports, the company said it was prioritizing a push into artificial intelligence over cryptocurrency investments. The Meta Bitcoin treasury proposal was submitted by investor Ethan Peck, who stands as a representative of the National Center for Public Research (NCPPR), asking the company to look into the likelihood of converting some of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin to preserve shareholder value better. At the time, the proposal gained noticeable attention, with Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor publicly drumming support for the initiative. Meta shareholders vote down Bitcoin adoption push According to filings, Meta, as of September 30, 2024, had about $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which the proposal claimed the values were being eroded by inflation and low returns. The move presents Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and strong trading pattern compared to bonds, as a reliable store of value in the long term. Meta Platforms Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal pic.twitter.com/ZeIrUHq2OK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) May 30, 2025 According to the filing, there has also been an increased push in institutional Bitcoin adoption, mentioning Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation, and speculations about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves in 2025. It also mentioned that Meta’s leadership had been showing interest in the asset, though via informal means, highlighting that its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max”. However, the board of directors was against the push, calling it unnecessary. In their response, the Meta board mentioned that the company already had a robust management practice in place, noting that it prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support its operations. The board also added that the company usually evaluates these broad ranges of investable assets and upon their recent evaluation, there was no need for a separate assessment focused on Bitcoin. Gravitation towards stablecoins and AI on the agenda According to a recent statement, the board explained its decision to ignore the buzz of digital assets. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury,” Meta’s board of directors noted in a statement. While the company may not be eyeing Bitcoin in the short term, there won’t be any surprises if it decides to shift focus in the future. This is because there has been a considerable number of firms that have made the shift in the past, including Strategy. In addition, there is also a rising trend of industry players making Bitcoin-focused investments over the last few months due to the now relaxed regulations in the United States. Also, there are reports that Meta may be looking into stablecoins in the time being, with the company also choosing to focus on its ongoing push into artificial intelligence . According to Forbes, Meta has explored integrating stablecoins into its platforms to facilitate global payouts, holding discussions with crypto infrastructure firms to that effect. The move marks a re-entry into the crypto space for the company after its exit from the industry some years back following a regulatory setback with its Diem project. The initial effort was looking into the use of stablecoins for cross-border payments, with the firm hoping to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional system.

2025-05-31T07:45:32,"Crypto Market Surges Past $3.5 Trillion as Institutions, DeFi, and Stablecoins Drive a New Era","The international cryptocurrency market has surged beyond an incredible $3.5 trillion in total capitalization, producing one of the most seismic rallies in digital asset history. At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin. That momentum looks set to continue; but strength is spreading across the broader ecosystem as well pic.twitter.com/j6g3IeDJ7F — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 29, 2025 Aave stands out among singularly-focused protocols, leading the decentralized lending market with an approximate total value locked of $25 billion. The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:40:57,"Bitcoin Dips 5% from Last Week’s High, But Strong On-Chain Support Near $100K Signals Potential Rebound","Recently, Bitcoin has had a notable correction and has come down about 5% from last week’s peak. This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:37:54,"Saudi Prince Drops $100 Million on XRP. Here’s What This Means for XRP","Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud has invested $100 million into XRP through a strategic partnership with publicly traded company VivoPower International PLC (NASDAQ: VVPR). In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.
