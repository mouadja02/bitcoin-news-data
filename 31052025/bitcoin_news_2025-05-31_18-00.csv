While stories of massive gains often capture headlines, significant losses are also a reality, especially for those playing at the highest levels. Recently, a prominent trader on the Hyperliquid platform, known as a Hyperliquid whale , experienced a staggering setback. What Led to This Massive Crypto Trading Loss? Data circulating in the crypto community highlights a dramatic crypto trading loss incurred by a trader identified as James Wynn. According to figures tracked by HyperDash, a platform monitoring Hyperliquid activity, Wynn reportedly lost a colossal $73.34 million over a mere seven-day period. This eye-watering figure serves as a stark reminder of the immense risks involved in the fast-paced decentralized finance (DeFi) trading environment, particularly when employing high leverage. Diving into James Wynn’s Leveraged Crypto Trading Strategy The significant loss is primarily attributed to James Wynn’s aggressive leveraged crypto trading strategy. At the time the data was reported, he held substantial long positions on two volatile assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and PEPE. Here’s a breakdown of the reported positions: Bitcoin (BTC) Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $105,554. The liquidation price for this position was set at $103,242. PEPE Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $0.0129. The liquidation price for this position was $0.0114. A 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital, Wynn was effectively controlling $40 worth of the underlying asset. While this amplifies potential profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses if the market turns. The small difference between the entry price and the liquidation price on both positions underscores just how precarious highly leveraged trades can be. Who is This Hyperliquid Whale? In cryptocurrency markets, a “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. Being identified as a Hyperliquid whale suggests James Wynn commands substantial capital and actively engages in large-scale trades on the platform. His recent James Wynn loss puts a spotlight on the sheer scale of capital that moves within these high-frequency trading venues. Whales often have a notable impact due to their ability to place massive orders that can move the order book. However, as this case illustrates, even whales are not immune to the market’s unforgiving nature, especially when utilizing high leverage. The Risks Amplified by Bitcoin Price Drop (and other market movements) While the data doesn’t specify the exact market movements that triggered the loss, it’s clear that adverse price action in Bitcoin and PEPE, potentially including a significant Bitcoin price drop or downward movement towards liquidation levels, played a critical role. With 40x leverage, a relatively small percentage drop in the asset’s price translates into a massive percentage loss on the trader’s principal capital. For instance, on a 40x leveraged long position, a drop of just 2.5% in the asset’s price can wipe out 100% of the initial margin used for that position (100% / 40 = 2.5%). The reported liquidation prices being so close to the entry prices confirm this extreme sensitivity to market fluctuations. Understanding the Dangers of High Leverage Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to increase their exposure to an asset with less capital upfront. However, it is a double-edged sword. The potential benefits of amplified gains are directly mirrored by the risks of amplified losses. Here are key dangers: Amplified Losses: The most significant risk. Small adverse price movements can lead to substantial losses that quickly exceed initial margin. Increased Liquidation Risk: High leverage brings your liquidation price closer to your entry price, making your position vulnerable to even minor market retracements. Margin Calls: Platforms may require additional funds (margin calls) to maintain a position if the market moves against you. Failure to meet a margin call results in liquidation. Emotional Stress: The high stakes and rapid potential for loss can lead to poor decision-making driven by fear or panic. Actionable Insights: Navigating Leveraged Trading Responsibly While the case of this Hyperliquid whale highlights the extreme end of potential losses, it offers valuable lessons for any trader considering or using leverage. Responsible leveraged crypto trading requires discipline and a strong understanding of risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Understand Leverage Fully: Never use leverage you don’t understand. Know exactly how much exposure you are taking on and how it affects your liquidation price. Start Small: If you are new to leverage, begin with very low multiples (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand its mechanics and risks without risking significant capital. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain unfavorable level, limiting potential losses. Avoid Excessive Leverage: High leverage (like 40x) should generally be avoided unless you are an extremely experienced trader with a robust risk management strategy and capital you can afford to lose entirely. Monitor Liquidation Price: Always know your liquidation price and understand what market movement would trigger it. Manage Position Size: Even with leverage, ensure the amount of capital allocated to a single leveraged trade is a small percentage of your total trading portfolio. The Aftermath: What Remains of James Wynn’s Positions? Following the reported $73.34 million loss, James Wynn’s current holdings on Hyperliquid were valued at around $760,000. This figure likely represents the remaining value in his trading account after the significant losses were realized from the highly leveraged positions. It underscores the dramatic impact the loss had on his capital, wiping out the vast majority of the funds tied up in those specific trades. Summary The reported $73.34 million James Wynn loss on Hyperliquid serves as a dramatic illustration of the inherent risks in high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. Even for a seasoned trader like a Hyperliquid whale , aggressive positions, such as 40x leverage on Bitcoin and PEPE, can lead to catastrophic outcomes when the market moves unfavorably. This event underscores the critical importance of understanding and managing the amplified risks associated with leveraged crypto trading , particularly in volatile conditions that can lead to a rapid Bitcoin price drop or similar sharp moves in other assets. While leverage offers the potential for amplified gains, this case is a powerful reminder that it can just as quickly lead to devastating losses if not handled with extreme caution and robust risk management practices.

He added that such a move could shake investor confidence and run afoul of federal tax law. The idea is part of Adams’ broader push to position New York as a global crypto hub. Since taking office, he has converted paychecks into crypto and launched a digital asset advisory council. But Lander pushed back against the bond, which could use some of the proceeds to buy BTC. He argued that the city’s borrowing system is grounded in the U.S. dollar, and any deviation would require mechanisms that the city doesn’t have, like converting bitcoin into cash for public spending.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/nyc-comptroller-slams-mayor-eric-adams-bitcoin-bond-plan-as-fiscally-irresponsible,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED","Markets|Bitcoin|New York|Eric Adams|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T15:30:31,"Bitcoin Price To Regain Upward Momentum? These Bitfinex Longs May Hold The Answer","The Bitcoin price has witnessed its fair share of corrections in recent days after reaching a new all-time high last week. The premier cryptocurrency’s latest performance reflects what seems to be an exhaustion of bullish strength, as the general market fell under some downward pressure in May’s final week. With the ongoing battle between the bulls and bears, there is no clear-cut way to tell what’s next for the Bitcoin price. However, a recent on-chain observation shows increased bullish activity on a popular centralized exchange, which could offer insight into the short-term movement of the market leader. ‘Decreased Bitfinex Longs May Be Good For BTC’s Momentum’ — Alphractal In a May 30 post on social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Alphractal delved into the relationship between leveraged long positions on crypto exchange Bitfinex and the Bitcoin price direction. This analysis is based on the Bitfinex Long Vs. Short Position metric, which estimates the ratio of buys against the sells of a cryptocurrency (BTC, in this case). According to Alphractal, the relationship between BTC’s price trajectory and the leveraged long positions on Bitfinex is inversely proportional. This means that if there are more long positions on the crypto trading platform, the likelihood of a price drop increases. Meanwhile, a decrease in long positions on the exchange could be bullish for the Bitcoin price. The analytics firm attributed this pattern to the propensity of traders to be wrong about the market’s actual trajectory. According to Alpractal, these wrong price predictions eventually lead to liquidations and forced position closures, which drive the BTC’s price in the opposite direction. In the recent post on X, Alphractal pointed out that the Bitfinex Long Position is declining, and if this trend is sustained, the premier cryptocurrency could resume its upward run . On the flip side, if the metric were to ascend above its current level, the Bitcoin price could be preparing for a severe pullback. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of press time, Bitcoin trades just above $104,100, reflecting a more than 2% decline in the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency’s performance is even more disappointing on the weekly timeframe, having lost over 4% of its value in the past seven days.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-regain-upward-momentum-bitfinex-longs/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin Price|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitfinex|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T15:30:18,"Bitcoin Boost: Brazil’s Méliuz Plans $78.6M Share Offering for BTC Treasury","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Boost: Brazil’s Méliuz Plans $78.6M Share Offering for BTC Treasury Big news from Latin America! Brazilian fintech company Méliuz is making a bold move into the world of cryptocurrency. They’ve announced plans for a significant primary share offering, aiming to raise substantial capital specifically to bolster their Bitcoin holdings. This development highlights the growing trend of corporate adoption of digital assets, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil . Why is Méliuz Planning a Share Offering for Bitcoin? According to reports, Méliuz intends to raise up to 450 million reais, which translates to approximately $78.6 million based on current exchange rates. The primary stated purpose for this capital raise is to purchase additional Bitcoin for the company’s corporate BTC Treasury . This isn’t Méliuz’s first foray into the crypto space; they already hold 320.25 BTC, valued at around $33.55 million at the time of the announcement. Companies decide to add Bitcoin to their treasury for various reasons. Here are a few common motivations: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in economies experiencing currency devaluation. Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ appeals to companies looking for a long-term store of value outside traditional financial assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investors: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and attract investors interested in the crypto market. Future Potential: Belief in the long-term growth and adoption of decentralized technologies and cryptocurrencies. For Méliuz, a fintech operating in Brazil, the decision could be influenced by a combination of these factors, potentially including the economic landscape in Brazil and the increasing interest in crypto within the region. Understanding the Share Offering Mechanism A primary Share Offering , also known as a public offering or equity offering, is when a company sells new shares of its stock to the public for the first time (IPO) or sells additional new shares after it’s already public (secondary offering). In this case, it appears to be a secondary offering since Méliuz is already a publicly traded company. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Méliuz announces its intention to sell new shares. The company works with investment banks to price and market the shares. Investors (institutional and retail) purchase the new shares. The capital raised from the sale goes directly to Méliuz. Méliuz plans to use a significant portion of these funds to acquire more Bitcoin . This method allows Méliuz to raise a substantial amount of cash relatively quickly, leveraging investor interest in their company to fund their strategic decision to expand their BTC Treasury . What Does This Mean for Méliuz and Bitcoin? For Méliuz , this move could be seen as a strategic play to align the company with the burgeoning digital asset economy. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings, they are making a clear statement about their confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future value. This could potentially attract a new segment of investors who are bullish on both fintech and crypto. For Bitcoin , corporate treasury adoption from publicly traded companies, especially those outside the traditional tech or finance hubs, is a positive signal. It demonstrates increasing mainstream acceptance and utility beyond speculative trading. While $78.6 million might seem modest compared to Bitcoin’s overall market cap, it represents a significant commitment from a company like Méliuz and contributes to the overall demand for BTC. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the move is strategic, it’s not without potential challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant drop in BTC’s price could negatively impact Méliuz’s balance sheet and stock performance. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in countries like Brazil . Changes could affect the holding or use of Bitcoin. Execution Risk: Successfully completing a large Share Offering depends on market conditions and investor demand. Investor Perception: While some investors will be excited, others might be wary of the risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet. Méliuz will need to navigate these factors carefully as they proceed with the offering and subsequent Bitcoin purchases. The Growing Trend of Corporate BTC Treasury Holdings Méliuz joins a growing list of companies worldwide that have allocated a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have been vocal advocates and large-scale accumulators of BTC. Other companies, including Tesla (though they have also sold some holdings), Square (now Block, Inc.), and various smaller firms, have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend suggests a shift in how some corporations view treasury management and asset allocation in the digital age. Méliuz’s decision highlights that this trend is not confined to Silicon Valley or North America but is gaining traction globally, with companies in regions like Brazil recognizing the potential of Bitcoin . In Conclusion: A Bold Step for Méliuz and Brazil Méliuz’s plan to raise $78.6 million through a Share Offering primarily to boost its BTC Treasury is a significant development. It underscores the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin and the willingness of companies, particularly in dynamic markets like Brazil , to integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. While risks exist, the move signals Méliuz’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin ‘s long-term value and its potential role in corporate finance. It will be interesting to watch how this strategy unfolds and if other Brazilian or Latin American companies follow suit.

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports , Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority. “We shouldn’t be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It’s not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.” Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn’t convinced about it. “If there’s a war in the South China Sea, we’ve got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That’s not something we should be saying with a straight face.” Dimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/jpmorgan-s-jamie-dimon-says-u-s-should-stockpile-missiles-not-bitcoin,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET","Markets|United States|Bitcoin|Jamie Dimon|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T15:22:11,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC’s Chances Of A Drop To $100,000 Increase","Bitcoin (BTC) has faced considerable selling pressure after reaching its new all-time high on May 22. Buyers are showing signs of fatigue after multiple failed attempts to push the price towards $115,000, leading to a substantial increase in bearish sentiment around the flagship cryptocurrency. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,527. Meta Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to assess adding Bitcoin to the company’s treasury. The results, shared by PhoenixNews, showed that 8.9 million shares were abstentions, and nearly 205 million shares were broker non-votes. The proposal, submitted by investor Ethan Peck, asked Meta to evaluate if converting a portion of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin would be better to preserve shareholder value. Meta had $72 billion in cash, cash reserves, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024. The proposal claims these are being eroded by inflation and low returns and presents Bitcoin as a more reliable long-term store of value. The proposal also highlighted growing institutional interest in Bitcoin adoption, presenting Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy as an example. It also mentioned BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation and speculation about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves. However, Meta’s board of directors dismissed the proposal, calling it unnecessary. The board added that Meta has a robust treasury management process that prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support operations. The board of directors released a statement, stating, “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury.” Bitcoin Supply Shock Could Amplify Prices: Sygnum Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at digital asset banking group Sygnum, believes a Bitcoin supply shock could have significant price implications compared to previous cycles. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect, meaning every $1 of demand leads to, say, $20-30 additional market capitalization. We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETFs or around the US elections.” Tischhauser highlighted the limited supply of the flagship cryptocurrency relative to institutional capital on the demand side as a reason for a possible spike in the Bitcoin price over the next few months. “This liquid supply has been falling steadily over the past 1.5 years, not least because of the proliferation of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles such as Strategy, Twenty-One Capital, and others.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could dip to $100,000 over the next few days if bearish sentiment persists. However, on-chain data suggests prolonged trading below this level could be limited. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered substantial selling pressure this week as it struggled to build momentum after surging to a new all-time high on May 22. A CryptoQuant analysis showed the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which tracks profits and losses from Bitcoin transactions, indicated moderate profit-taking at current levels. Another metric supporting a quick rebound if BTC slips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, which sits at $96,000. If the price falls below $100,000, the $96,000 could act as a floor, attracting buyers and limiting downside. According to crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa, current market conditions are ideal for a price recovery in the coming days. “still not rushing into any positions personally. Lost some $ yesterday by overstaying my welcome and roundtripping w. that Trump tweet, is what it is. Overall, I still think it's a scalping environment. I do think $BTC bounces relatively soon, though.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action over the past two weeks. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping to an intraday low of $102,135 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, and BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week with a marginal increase but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954.

Bitcoin dropped to $103,000, while the market cap of all coins fell by double digits. Let’s explore some of the top movers in the cryptocurrency market today. Why the crypto market is falling today Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies continued its strong downward tend as concerns about trade rose. Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imported steel and aluminium. He said this at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he made the case for his approval of the Nippon and US Steel purchase. Details of that transaction are still thin, though the US is expected to maintain a golden share in the company. The statement came on the same day that he accused China of not living to its deal in Switzerland. Also, Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, warned that talks between the two countries had moved into a stalemate. These risks have led to a sense of fear among market participants, which explains why the stock market has also pulled back. The crypto market crashed as investors positioned themselves for June, a month that s historically bearish for Bitcoin and other altcoins. Read more: Crypto market crash: is this the end of the bull run? Cronos price jumped as ETF hopes rose The Cronos token hit a high of $0.1070 on Saturday, its highest level since April 2, and 57% above its lowest point this year. CRO price jumped after Canary filed for a spot CRO ETF with staking feature. This fund will give investors access to the staking fee that users get. The daily chart shows that the CRO price bottomed at $0.067 in March and then bounced back to a high of $0.1070 today. It has moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since February. Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% retracement level at $0.1500, which is about 40% above the current level. Livepeer price crashes Livepeer price chart | Source: TradingView LPT token surged to $14.23, its highest level since January 18, and up by 342% from its lowest level in April. It jumped sharply after it was listed by Upbit, the biggest crypto exchange in South Korea. Tokens often surge after being listed by Upbit and other major exchanges. These gains, however, are usually short-lived, which explains why the Livepeer price has dropped sharply on Saturday. Technicals suggest that the token has more downside to go, with the next price to watch being at $6.65. A move above the resistance at $14.23 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Strategy led the list of corporate BTC accumulators, but more public companies followed the same playbook at smaller scales. A Bitwise report revealed that publicly traded companies held roughly 688K BTC by the end of March, representing a 16.1% quarter-on-quarter surge. Total corporate BTC holdings represented a 2.15% increase in total value from the previous quarter and 3.28% of the 21M BTC supply. The increase in holdings pushed the total value of Bitcoin held by public firms to approximately $56.7B, based on an average BTC price of $82,445. The report also revealed that 12 new companies added Bitcoin to their treasuries for the first time during Q1 2025, increasing the total number of publicly traded firms accumulating BTC to 79. Hong Kong-based Ming Shing was the largest new buyer. Its subsidiary, Lead Benefit, acquired 833 BTC in two separate purchases in January and February. Strategy leads public firms in BTC acquisition during Q1 2025 CryptoQuant data revealed that Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) added 81,785 BTC in Q1 2025, spending slightly above $8 billion. It also spent $1.4 billion to acquire 15,355 Bitcoin from April 21 to April 28, bringing its total holdings to 553,555 BTC worth over $52 billion based on BTC’s price of over $95K at the time. Strategy bought 1,895 more BTC during the week of April 28 to May 4, 2025, at an average price of $95,167, bringing its total holdings to 555,450 BTCs valued at around $57.7 billion based on BTC price at the time. Rumble made headlines with a 188 BTC buy in March, while another unexpected entrant, HK Asia Holdings Limited, bought just one Bitcoin in February, which doubled its share price in a single trading day. Japan’s Metaplanet also disclosed on April 14 that it had purchased an additional 319 BTC at an average price of about $82,770, bringing its total holdings to 4,525 BTC valued at around $383.2 million. Metaplanet’s $406 million BTC investment positioned it among the top corporate holders globally — currently ranked tenth, just behind Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. According to Arkham data, cryptoQuant data also showed that Tether added 8,888 BTC to its reserves in Q1 2025, pushing its holdings to over 100,000 BTC. Other notable companies that bought Bitcoin include the Blockchain Company, which added 605 BTC to its balance sheet, and Semler Scientific, which bought 1,108 BTC. $660 billion Susquehanna bought nearly $300 million more Bitcoin in Q1 and now owns $1.3 billion worth of BTC.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen considered Bitcoin a tool for hedging against currency depreciation, adding that its growth potential could be even greater than expected. Meanwhile, the company is holding $1.5 billion in newly raised funds under the codename Project Rocket to invest in Bitcoin, adding to its $4.75 billion cash reserves. Brazilian public company Meliuz filed to raise $26.45 million to buy Bitcoin, while Sharplink Gaming is set to raise $1 billion to buy BTC. French company The Blockchain Group is also gearing up to raise €12.1 million to buy more Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Econometrics also observed that public companies were starting to outpace ETFs in Bitcoin accumulation. According to his analysis, these companies added more BTC to their balance sheets than the spot ETFs over the past three quarters (including Q1 2025).

2025-05-31T14:40:34,"IMF presses Pakistan for clarifications over bold Bitcoin pivot","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has criticized Pakistan’s decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity for cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence data centers, with the body expressing concerns over the move. Pakistan and the IMF remain in talks amid sensitive budget discussions. The IMF’s reservation comes days after the country unveiled its first government-led Bitcoin reserve during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. The move signals a shift in the country’s priority towards digital finance. At the event, the crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Bilal bin Saqib mentioned that the country had launched a Bitcoin wallet and has committed significant energy resources to support the digital asset industry. “Our youth are online and on-chain. Pakistan, with over 40 million crypto wallets and an average age of 23 years, is now being recognized for its future rather than its past,” Bilal bin Saqib said at the event. IMF raises concerns over Pakistan’s latest move During the launch, Saqib mentioned that the development is expected to open doors to several entities, including autonomous miners, technology firms, and blockchain companies to invest in Pakistan. However, the IMF frowned at the announcement, with the body seeking clarification from the Finance Minister over the legality of the move and the electricity allocation, even in the face of constant energy shortages and fiscal constraints. According to sources inside the Finance Ministry, the decision was taken without consulting the IMF and has raised questions over the legal status of digital assets in Pakistan. The government has yet to respond to the IMF’s concerns about electricity tariffs and resource distribution. The IMF representative also declined to comment when asked to. However, the source said that the body has mentioned that all policy steps under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) must be carried out in consultation with it. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations said. “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks.” The IMF delegation, currently locked in virtual talks with Pakistani officials, is expected to hold a private session to discuss the government’s plan to provide electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. Formation of new digital asset authority underway The new policy decision is part of a bigger government strategy to include digital assets in the country’s economy. An important aspect of this plan is the creation of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), as approved by the Finance Ministry. The body will be tasked with regulating crypto exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It will also be in charge of the tokenization of national assets and debt, aligning the country’s crypto policies with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). During the event, Bilal bin Saqib also urged global investors to join Pakistan’s digital shift, urging them to come and invest in the country’s growing ecosystem. “The PDAA is a critical step in protecting global investors and formalizing Pakistan’s role in the digital economy,” Bilal bin Saqib noted. The event was attended by prominent figures, including United States Vice President JD Vance and Eric and Donald Trump Jr., the sons of United States President Donald Trump. Pakistan began to shift its previous stance on digital assets earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. The body was tasked with drawing up a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and attracting foreign investments into the country’s crypto ecosystem. Among the early proposals of the council was the use of surplus energy for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data center operations.

2025-05-31T14:30:39,"Is Bitcoin Price Doomed For $93K? Technical Indicators Paint A Bearish Image","The Bitcoin price has not quite been able to maintain the bullish momentum that saw it climb to a new all-time high last week. Instead, the premier cryptocurrency has succumbed to bearish pressure over the past few days, falling about 7% from its record-high price. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin price seems to be at the start of what could be a disappointing downward run over the coming weeks. The latest technical price data indicate a potential bearish trend reversal for the price of BTC, with the market leader at risk of losing its six-figure valuation. Which Technical Indicators Are Sounding The Sell Alarm? In a May 30 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci provided a technical insight into the price of Bitcoin, explaining that signs are quickly turning bearish for the flagship cryptocurrency. The online pundit projected that BTC could face a severe price downturn to around the $93,000 level in the near future. Related Reading: Halfway To Clean: Bitcoin Hits 50% Renewable Mark, Ripple Chairman Reacts Kesmeci highlighted changes in some technical indicators on the daily timeframe, suggesting that a correction might be on the horizon for the Bitcoin price. One of these indicators is the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that estimates the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price movements. As observed in the chart above, the daily RSI is around 51 points and below the 14-day simple moving average (SMA). According to the crypto analyst, this technical indicator shift points to a weakening bullish momentum for the Bitcoin price. Kesmeci also noted that the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP), which analyzes trading volume around a price region, signals a heavy trading zone around the $103,500 level. A sustained close beneath this level could lead to elevated selling pressure for the flagship cryptocurrency, the analyst said. Furthermore, Kesmeci mentioned that the AlphaTrend indicates that a second close below 106.269 may trigger a “sell” signal for the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) suggests that the bears are gaining the upper hand in the market. Finally, Kesmeci pinpointed the next target at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level and the FRVP Value Area Low (VAL), both of which could be considered major support zones, at around $93,000 and $91,800, respectively. Ultimately, all these technical levels suggest that the Bitcoin price may correct to the $91,000 – $93,000 bracket. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $104,000 mark, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours.

According to the settlement portal , $20 million will be shared among more than five million affected users of the cybersecurity firm Fortra’s file transfer platform. The impacted data includes “names, addresses, dates of birth, member identification numbers, telephone numbers, employer names, Social Security numbers, start and end dates of health plan coverage, and health insurance information.” The lawsuit was filed against Fortra, as well as rail service provider Brightline, healthcare firms Aetna, Community Health, Elevance Health, Fortra, Imagine360, Intellihartx, NationsBenefits and Santa Clara Family Health Plan. Class members who provide “reasonable documentation for losses” of the 2023 data breach will receive up to $5,000. In the absence of documentation proving the extent of the losses they suffered as a result of the data breach, class members will receive around $85. Claims must be submitted by August 29th. Besides the cash payment, class members are also eligible to receive dark web monitoring services for one year to mitigate the risks of potential identity theft and fraud. The payments will be made once the court gives the class action settlement final approval. A final approval hearing of the lawsuit settlement terms will be held in mid-September.

2025-05-31T14:20:37,"Texas Bitcoin reserve bill heads for governor's desk for approval","Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) Bill SB21 has scaled the legislative hurdle after the state Senate adopted the Conference Committee report. The support was overwhelming, with a majority of 24 – 7 voting to adopt the report. With this move, the bill has finally scaled the legislative process and is heading to the Governor’s desk for evaluation. According to Bitcoin Laws , adopting the Conference Committee report meant that the Senate agreed with all the changes to the bill. The House initially approved the report on May 30, with 110 members for it and only 25 against it. This approval finalizes the long legislative process for SB21, which was further extended due to amendments to the bill. With the House and Senate having different versions, the two chambers formed the Conference Committee to agree on these amendments. Some of the amendments that the Conference Committee kept include the House amendment, which increased the market cap for eligible reserve assets to at least $500 billion market cap for the last 24 months. However, it removed the provision that allows the comptroller to stake reserve assets. If passed, the bill would allow the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, the state’s chief financial officer, to create a crypto reserve using part of the state investment funds. It also establishes a five-member advisory committee that will set the investment policies and requires the comptroller to publish financial status reports every two years. Texas to join New Hampshire as states with Bitcoin reserves Many believe Governor Greg Abbot will pass the bill, allowing Texas to join New Hampshire and Arizona as US states with an SBR law. Abbot has shown public support for the bill by sharing an article praising the legislative efforts on X. The bill also benefits Texas by making it the crypto capital of the US. The state is already the biggest for Bitcoin mining in the US, with the state responsible for most of the US Bitcoin mining hash rate. Thus, creating an SBR will only boost its crypto credentials. The state has the second-biggest economy in the US, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.7 trillion, only behind California and ahead of New York. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis , its economy is growing faster than that of the US. While Texas could become the third state with an SBR law, it is set to be the second state to commit part of its portfolio to invest in crypto assets to hedge against inflation. New Hampshire already has the honor of being the first state to have an SBR law that enables the state treasurer to invest in crypto assets. However, the Arizona SBR law does not allow the investment of state funds into crypto assets. Instead, the enacted crypto reserve bill HB 2749 only permits the creation of a crypto reserve to be funded using unclaimed crypto assets, airdrops, and staking rewards. The Arizona SBR law represents a compromise after the state governor, Katie Hobbs, vetoed two other SBR bills requiring the state to invest, noting that the “current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars.” 30 State SBR bills currently under consideration in the US Meanwhile, more states still have SBR bills in the works, with the majority in the committee stage showing massive interest in Bitcoin reserves. States such as North Carolina, Alabama, Montana, Georgia, and Iowa have their SBR bills in different stages. However, it is not just SBRs that are gaining interest. Pro-crypto legislative efforts have generally increased, with Michigan recently introducing four new bills related to Bitcoin and other crypto assets. One of the bills could allow investment of some of state retirement funds into cryptocurrencies. There is another bill to ban the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while proposed legislation seeks to allow Bitcoin mining projects on abandoned oil and gas wells, with tax deductions for the mining programs. The state has a total of seven pro-Bitcoin bills under consideration and recently declared May 13, 2025, as Digital Awareness Day through House Resolution 100. The resolution stated that the designation will encourage activities and programs that enable a better understanding of digital assets and their impacts.

2025-05-31T14:15:07,"SEC’s Crypto Task Force Chair Hester Peirce Delivers Definitive Take on TRUMP and All Memecoins","Hester Peirce, a senior member of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has announced that the agency is now withdrawing from its role in regulating memecoins. This means that investors should not expect any protection or guidance regarding their tokens like TRUMP. “There is a lot of interest in memecoins, but people should know this: You should not expect SEC protection in these assets,” Peirce said in an interview with CNBC. This statement came at the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas. The SEC said in February that most memecoins were not considered securities under U.S. federal law, leaving the agency ungoverned by assets such as the TRUMP token, which was launched weeks after Trump was reinstated as president. Peirce likened this process to NFTs, which became popular in 2021, and argued that the SEC should announce its inactivity with a clear public statement on this issue, as it did at that time. Related News: Massive Altcoin Whale Misses Out on $42.64 Million in Profits - Bought High, Sold Low, Here Are the Trades It Made On the other hand, since President Trump took office, the SEC has taken a softer, more industry-friendly approach towards the cryptocurrency industry, but this strategy has raised conflict of interest allegations as the Trump family has become increasingly involved in crypto. The Trump Organization and its affiliates control 80% of the TRUMP token. The token skyrocketed in January after Trump made statements on social media, reaching a market value of $15 billion. However, it soon lost a significant amount of value. Still, project developers continue to make money thanks to the fees charged per transaction. The White House maintains that there is no conflict of interest by saying Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children, but figures such as Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal have warned that such assets could be a “back door” for foreign or corporate interests to access the president. SEC Member Peirce said the agency’s decisions were not politically motivated: “We didn’t have clear rules. There were a lot of questions about how crypto activities intersect with securities laws. Now we want to take a step back and write clear rules.” *This is not investment advice.

This move has cleared the final legislative hurdle for the state’s proposed Bitcoin reserve fund. With both chambers adopting the measure, the legislation advances to Governor Greg Abbott for final approval and signature into law. During floor proceedings, Senator Schwertner declared the motion’s success and underlined that the law creates the Texas Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve as a specialized fund that would be administered by the state Comptroller of Public Accounts.

Texas SBR incoming. https://t.co/0LlkqNHntC pic.twitter.com/MNOTWCMC6D — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) May 31, 2025 Enhanced provisions added through legislative process The final version incorporates several amendments that emerged during House deliberations. This includes authorization for the Comptroller to engage qualified liquidity providers and expand the fund’s financial capabilities. Legislative negotiators made major modifications to the original proposal during conference committee discussions. A key revision extends the duration requirement for eligible cryptocurrencies from 12 months to 24 months. This means altcoins must maintain a minimum market capitalization of $500 billion for two full years before qualifying for inclusion in the reserve. Members of the conference committee declined to allow the Comptroller to use reserve assets for lending or staking. In addition, they removed clauses that would have allowed voluntary cryptocurrency contributions to the fund. The legislation positions Texas to become the third state to establish an official Bitcoin reserve. This is following pioneering efforts by New Hampshire and Arizona. The development shows a growing trend among state governments exploring cryptocurrency as a tool for financial diversification and economic resilience. New Hampshire’s framework served as a reference point for Texas legislators, particularly regarding the methodology for evaluating and incorporating additional digital assets beyond Bitcoin i nto state reserves. The $500 billion market capitalization threshold represents one of the most stringent requirements among state-level cryptocurrency initiatives. With a number of mining operations and blockchain startups establishing significant presences within state borders, Texas has established itself as a leader in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The sports betting platform, on May 30, filed an S-3 ASR form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, officially declaring its intent to issue securities worth a staggering $1 billion. SharpLink disclosed that the purpose of the fundraiser is to purchase more Ethereum for its reserve.A Saylor Strategy, but for Ethereum Notably, Bitcoin is slowly becoming a part of the balance sheet of a growing number of institutions globally, thanks to Michael Saylor’s successful Bitcoin strategy, applied at MicroStrategy . Meanwhile, SharpLink appears to be copying the playbook, as most have, but for the altcoin leader, Ethereum. Initially, on May 27, the iGaming firm announced it has created an Ethereum-based treasury, nominating Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors. For the uninitiated, Lubin is an Ethereum co-founder and the CEO of Consensys, an Ethereum-focused software production studio.The announcement followed a $425 million securities purchase agreement, under which it offered its common stock at $6.15 per share to investors. Consensys led the funding round, with other notable investors including Pantera Capital, Digital Galaxy, and Ondo.Three days later, SharpLink plans to raise another $1 billion to fund its Ethereum treasury. Friday's S-3 ASR filing with the US SEC indicates that the firm intends to raise the cash by offering its common stock to qualified investors at $79.21 per share.The Nasdaq-listed public firm would use proceeds from the offering largely to buy Ethereum. Meanwhile, the leftover funds will cover other expenses, such as general operating costs.“Lubin Pulls a MicroStrategy for ETH”Meanwhile, the announcement has sparked positive sentiments within the Ethereum community, as optimism of a bullish momentum intensifies. Among others, market enthusiasts also expressed excitement that Ethereum may have found its own Saylor and Strategy.Eric Conner, an Ethereum and AI enthusiast, stated that Lubin “just pulled a MicroStrategy for ETH.” He expressed confidence that the deal would spell more demand for Ethereum, noting that the Saylor playbook now runs on Ethereum. https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1927380671334404511Other reactions also followed the thought pattern, with another user, OxBoboShanti, mentioning that Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.Remarkably, corporate firms are beginning to look beyond Bitcoin and have increasingly allocated to altcoins too. BTCS announced it would purchase $57.8 million worth of Ethereum earlier this month, while Nasdaq-listed Digital Commodity Capital Corporation revealed that it holds 103,000 XRP in its treasury.SharpLink’s Stock SoarsInterestingly, SharpLink offered its stocks on May 27 at $6.15; three days later, it is now offering them at $79.21. This is a testament to the stock’s price explosion following its announcement of a strategic Ethereum reserve.Its stock, under the ticker SBET, has surged 1,822% in the past five days, rallying from $3.99 to $76.70 at the time of writing.

2025-05-31T13:40:15,"Brazil's Méliuz offers stocks to add more Bitcoin to treasury","Brazilian firm Méliuz has announced a share offering to fund the purchase of additional Bitcoin for its treasury. According to the firm, it plans to raise 450 million reais (about $78 million) to purchase the leading digital asset, a move that has caused its shares to tumble over 8%. Méliuz, which trades in the cashback and coupon business, trades on the B3 exchange in Brazil under the ticker CASH3. The company initially plans to offer about 17 million common shares to raise around 150 million reais (approximately $26.2 million). The company also left enough space to expand the offering by up to 200%, which could see it triple the amount if demand goes as planned. Méliuz embraces Bitcoin amid its transformation The latest announcement marks a new chapter in the company’s transformation, moving from a traditional fintech to what can be described as the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil. Since March, when the company made a $4.13 million Bitcoin purchase, Méliuz has accumulated around 320.2 BTC, currently worth $33.55 million. It also became one of the first fintech companies in Brazil to offer crypto exposure to its clients, with this new step a way to increase its involvement in the industry. “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share,” the company said in a previous statement about its strategy shift. Markets appear to have priced in the news, with the company’s stock swinging wildly over the past year. The stock is up 217% since the beginning of 2025 at around 2.53 reais per share, climbing to a high of around 11 reais. The recent drop saw the price hit 8.13 reais, with trading volume hitting 6.51 million shares. According to Ray Nasser, the head of the Latin America branch of trading firm BlockFills, Méliuz has been adopting the same strategy as Michael Saylor-owned Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). He mentioned that the move has been able to help its shareholders get better value for their money. “The company lost its relevance over the years, and its stock price went down,” he said. “Although it made a turnaround in 2024, it’s doing what Strategy is doing now, it’s riding the hype.” Comparison to Strategy and Bitcoin adoption The firm has earned the compliment of being compared to United States firm, Strategy over the last few years. Strategy kickstarted the big-scale Bitcoin adoption in the United States, with the firm now holding about 580,250 Bitcoins, worth over $60 billion, using several capital raises. During the bull run, the company’s stock outperformed Bitcoin itself, creating what some analysts called a “Bitcoin proxy” for investors. But Méliuz carries out its operation differently, with the company’s market cap hovering around 305 million reais ($53.8 million), a fraction of its 9 billion reais peak after it went public in 2020. Meanwhile, the company has set its pricing for June 12, with trading of the new shares beginning on June 16. The company has scheduled two priority subscription periods for existing shareholders, with the first expected to start on June 4 after a June 3 cutoff date, and the second expected to end on June 10, after a June 9 cutoff date, allowing them to own the new shares first. The company was founded in 2011 and has built its business on cashback rewards and discount coupons, partnering with over 1,000 brands and accumulating 35 million registered users. Méliuz started offering Bitcoin exposure to clients back in 2022 when PayPal and other companies showed positive results experimenting with crypto purchases.

2025-05-31T13:20:35,"Will Bitcoin bears drag price to $100K as BTC struggles at $103K?","The global crypto market printed red indexes over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below the $104,000 mark. The BTC slide triggered a massive $687 million in trader liquidations, the biggest wipeout seen since February. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by over 2% to stand at $3.24 trillion. The sell-off got triggered by US President Donald Trump’s reignition of trade war fears by doubling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum to 50%. He accused Beijing of breaking a key May agreement. Trump’s aggressive stance sent shockwaves through global markets, raising concerns over economic fallout. Bitcoin bears eye $102K next Data shows that Bitcoin is stuck below $104K after facing rejection from $106K due to increased selling pressure. It will be crucial to see if bulls can defend this level. Bitcoin futures saw over $153 million being liquidated. 93% of these liquidated positions ($137 million) turned out to be long bets set in BTC price action. It was followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $122 million, Solana (SOL) at $33 million, XRP at $30 million, and Dogecoin at over $22 million. As per IT tech, a cryptoquant analyst, the Bitcoin price trend of printing lower highs and lower lows confirms bearish momentum. The “sell” signal got confirmed at $106k, which shifted down the trend and is still expanding downward. Bitcoin is still stuck below $104K after rejection from $106K Price just wicked into $103K territory with visible pressure from sellers. Can bulls defend this level again or is $102K next on the radar? Full liquidation and trend breakdown below 👇 📊 Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)… pic.twitter.com/zDaLTBjRfo — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) May 31, 2025 It added that bears are maintaining control below $104K, while no recent buy signals are emerging as bulls lack strength. Volume profile depicts that there is a heavy interest around $103K, and the breakdown below this level will signal a deeper move towards the $102K zone. Bears are pressing the market lower, and the $103K zone remains a critical short-term support. However, if BTC surges past $104.8K would be the first sign for bulls to regain momentum. Big whales flip to selling mode Bitcoin price dropped by more than 5% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,528 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume dipped by 20% to stand at $50.73 billion. On-chain data reveals that while open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April and options have skyrocketed 126%. Big players like whales holding over 10,000 BTC have quietly flipped from accumulation to net selling. This has pushed coins back onto exchanges in a classic profit-taking scenario. Bitcoin-linked ETFs depict the position. May 30 saw a total net outflow of $616 million from US BTC ETFs, with none of the twelve ETFs recording a net inflow. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs posted a net inflow of over $70 million, hitting 10 consecutive days of inflows. The Fear and Greed index has turned back to the “Neutral” zone after flashing greed for a couple of weeks. With Ether and XRP down by nearly 4%, and Solana off by 6%, traders are now watching for a potential reversal or bracing for more turbulence.

2025-05-31T13:15:46,"Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs","The post Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s safe to say most of us did not see this coming! Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , briefly climbed higher than Bill Gates on the global wealth chart. But as quickly as it happened, a Bitcoin price drop pulled Nakamoto back down. Still, the moment sparked a fresh wave of interest in crypto’s most famous ghost and the fortune they’re quietly sitting on. Bitcoin Rally Pushed Nakamoto Ahead of Gates Nakamoto’s wallet, believed to hold 1.1 million BTC – around 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply – recently reached a massive $113.8 billion , according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham . That briefly put him ahead of Bill Gates , whose fortune stood at $112.9 billion , based on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires list . It was enough to make Nakamoto the 12th richest person in the world , if only for a moment. The surge was driven by optimism around a potential U.S.–China trade deal , which helped push Bitcoin’s price higher. But the Lead Didn’t Last Long The crypto market, as always, had other plans. Bitcoin’s price slipped again, bringing Nakamoto’s estimated net worth back to around $114 billion as of May 31, 2025 . Meanwhile, Gates’ net worth has risen to $166.3 billion , putting a wide gap back between the two. Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, Anyway? Nakamoto’s true identity remains one of crypto’s biggest unanswered questions. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, people have speculated that it could be Nick Szabo , Len Sassaman , or Peter Todd . In 2024, a documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery pointed the finger at Peter Todd but he quickly denied any connection. That only added to the legend of Satoshi: a billionaire who might not even know they’re currently one of the wealthiest people alive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation , Could Nakamoto Catch Up to Elon Musk? Topping Elon Musk , who currently has a net worth of $422.7 billion , would be a much bigger jump. For Nakamoto to match Musk, Bitcoin would need to skyrocket to $406,000 per coin. It sounds far-fetched, but in crypto, strange things happen all the time and this recent Gates moment proved that anything’s possible. Crypto’s Wealth Race: Who’s Next? This back-and-forth between Nakamoto and Gates shows just how unpredictable crypto can be. If Bitcoin rallies again, Nakamoto could easily reclaim the edge especially with Gates’ wealth holding steady. As the market keeps moving, the crypto world is watching closely – because in this game, one price spike could change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined for three consecutive days, hitting a low of $2,500. That’s a 9.8% drop from its monthly high. Despite the pullback, it has outperformed most altcoins, many of which have fallen more than 15% from their highs this month. ETH retreated ahead of June, which is usually its worst month, because of the start of summer. CoinGlass data shows that the average monthly performance in June since 2016 is minus 7.4%. Its median monthly return in June is minus 8.68%. ETH monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass June is also Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) second-worst-performing month after September, with an average return of minus 0.35%. Seasonality does not always work out. For example, ETH dropped by 18% in March, bucking a four-year trend of gains. It also dropped by 31% in February, after recording positive gains in the last six consecutive years.

2025-05-31T13:05:37,"Trader Says Bitcoin Could Crash by Double-Digit Percentage Points After Confirming Downtrend – Here Are His Targets","Analyst and trader Justin Bennett believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) has further room to fall after the crypto king broke down. Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has a “confirmed break” after falling below a support level at around $106,000. According to Bennett, Bitcoin could fall by up to around 13% from the current level to a price of about $91,790 if BTC loses support levels that are around $100,730 and then $97,762. “Those downside targets are in play as long as $106,000 holds as new resistance on the daily time frame.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst and trader further says that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum ( ETH ), could turn bearish as USDT dominance, the percentage of USDT’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, rises. “This is the same Tether dominance outlook as eight days ago, and now we have a confirmed breakout. There are no guarantees, but you have to respect what’s on the chart, not what you hope will happen. If it holds, BTC and ETH pull back. Keep it simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Turning to Ethereum, Bennett says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is leaning bearish after breaking below an ascending trendline on the four-hour chart. “A little speculative right now, but I’d be willing to bet that ETH breaking this trend line opens up $2,460 and $2,360. Today’s fakeout above range highs gives Ethereum a bearish tilt. That said, markets could chop around while some of these supports hold.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,365 at time of writing, while Ethereum is trading at $2,605.

2025-05-31T12:51:49,"Bitcoin’s Path to $300K Could Face Geopolitical Risks, While Emotional Trading Add Uncertainty","Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally to an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22nd has ushered in a wave of heightened investor expectations. The surge, catalyzed by a sudden bullish breakout following the White House’s decision to delay 50% tariffs on EU goods, has since been tempered by geopolitical uncertainty and clear signs of market overexuberance. Social Chatter on Bitcoin Santiment’s data shows a sharp uptick in crowd optimism precisely as Bitcoin peaked, which led to an immediate correction. This is a reminder that extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks. Positive sentiment across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram hit its highest point this year on May 22, only to be swiftly reversed when President Trump’s tariff threat caused market jitters. Although the federal court ruling on May 28 deemed the “Liberation Day” tariffs unconstitutional, offering temporary relief, Santiment warned that recurring tariff-related discussions are now a key driver of volatility. Mentions of “tariff” and “trade war” spiked on social media in the final days of May, mirroring patterns observed during the April correction. Despite the cooling, the crowd remains bullish. The most popular Bitcoin options call is now for $300K. This sentiment depicted rising long-term expectations despite near-term instability. Santiment’s report also explained the reliability of crowd sentiment as a counter-indicator, with extreme fear on May 25 coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound to $106K. Meanwhile, blockchain fundamentals continue to show strength. Over 147,000 BTC have exited exchanges in 2025, which reduced immediate sell pressure and suggested continued confidence among holders. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has declined steadily since mid-April, indicating that older coins are being reactivated. Such a trend is typically a bullish signal associated with ongoing price expansions. Santiment noted that these shifts suggest the rally is driven not solely by speculative frenzy. BTC’s Path Ahead BTC whales continue to shape market tops. On the day of Bitcoin’s ATH, there were 18,782 transactions of over $100,000. Interestingly, this was the highest since Trump’s inauguration in January, suggesting significant profit-taking by institutional players. In fact, one whale held a 40x leveraged position now worth $1.2 billion. As such, the report warns that a liquidation event below $104,810 could trigger a cascade of long positions unwinding. As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, data shows that emotional extremes and external shocks continue to dictate short-term moves, even as exchange flows and coin age metrics point toward deeper bullish foundations. The road to $300K may be steep, but investor expectations, like Bitcoin’s price, have never been higher.

2025-05-31T12:47:32,"Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It","The post Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Pakistan plans to allocate 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and create a national Bitcoin reserve amid political and economic instability. IMF raises concerns over the project’s viability and energy use, questioning its feasibility amid Pakistan’s high energy costs and weak grid. This week Pakistan’s recent announcement to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining was a remarkable move. Later this week they also said that Pakistan has plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , this update joined amid ongoing political tensions, financial distress, and border issues. While a normal impression might be optimistic, compared with countries like El Salvador , but it’s not very optimistic. While this initiative signals a potential policy shift in the country, but its direct and immediate impact on the Bitcoin price is anticipated to be very minimal, largely due to a confluence of significant domestic challenges and international scrutiny. Adding to the challenges, the IMF has questioned Pakistan and raised red flags about the move. Keep reading to know more. Economic Viability and Infrastructure Concerns The ambitious mining plan of Pakistan faces tremendous economic viability issues, and power generation is less of an issue than its per kWh charges. The country has commercial electricity rates which are hovering somewhere around $0.20- $0.22/kWh, and are considerably higher than those in competitive mining hubs like Iran, Kuwait and other countries. Moreover, an electrical engineer based in Pakistan highlighted that even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, the cost remains barely competitive for large-scale operations compared to other countries in the global Bitcoin mining. The pricing was a major issue, but beyond pricing, the nation’s power infrastructure presents further obstacles. As Pakistan’s grid suffers from inconsistent service, distribution and transmission losses. These are major risks for energy-intensive mining facilities. IMF Scrutiny and Regulatory Roadblocks Adding to these internal challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added red flags and asked several questions, as they said this announcement was done without IMF consultation. They voiced serious concerns regarding Pakistan’s plan like the rationale behind allocating such a substantial amount of electricity, especially given the country’s ongoing chronic energy shortages and declining countries fiscal conditions. Moreover, this external oversight clearly indicates the complexities involved in moving from a conceptual plan to a fully operational one. This creates an uncertain situation for Pakistan’s dreams related to Bitcoin crypto’s. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Appoints Special Assistant for Blockchain and Crypto in PM’s Cabinet , Limited Short-to-Medium Term Impact on Bitcoin Price While the move was strategic or chaotic still remains a question. But, if in case it does establish a Bitcoin mining facility in Pakistan. It wouldn’t send the BTC price to hit mars or jupiter, from one financially weakend country’s action. Its effort could incrementally contribute to the network’s security and global demand for Bitcoin in the long run, but no major outcome seems likely in the future. Moreover, the current viability challenges and the critical intervention from the foreign organization clearly hints that its direct influence on global Bitcoin price will likely remain limited in the short to medium term, only if they successfully set up their plan in motion. However, the long-run outlook totally depends on the broader market forces, global adoption trends, and major regulatory developments. These are the combined factors that are expected to continue to be the primary drivers of the future Bitcoin price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T12:42:37,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Football Club PSG Embraces Crypto","Paris Saint-Germain F.C. has confirmed its adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, making it the first major football club to officially add BTC to its financial books. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, revealed that the club began accumulating Bitcoin in 2024 and still holds it as part of its reserves. This announcement arrives just as PSG prepares for the Champions League final, bringing both the sporting and financial spotlight onto the club. PSG also shared plans to support Bitcoin ventures and founders, signaling a deeper commitment beyond holding assets. PSG’s Bitcoin Strategy May Influence Sports and Crypto Alike Paris Saint-Germain isn’t new to experimenting with crypto—its fan tokens and Web3 initiatives go back years. But converting fiat reserves into Bitcoin and holding them long-term is an entirely different commitment. This isn’t a marketing gimmick or a temporary flirtation with blockchain. This is treasury allocation—something previously seen in corporate circles, now adopted by a leading sports brand. What’s striking is not just the move itself but the context around it. PSG’s fanbase is largely under 34, a demographic already entrenched in digital assets. The club’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin reflects an understanding of its own audience and a belief that future value will be driven by crypto-native systems. JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 Through PSG Labs, the club is not only holding BTC but actively seeking to invest in and accelerate crypto projects, startups, and builders. This approach could spark a new playbook for other top-tier clubs and sports leagues. If PSG’s venture into Bitcoin pays off—not just financially, but reputationally—it’s likely that others in the sports and entertainment space will follow. Crypto could evolve from niche sponsorships and collectibles into a structural pillar of how major teams manage wealth, foster innovation, and engage their fanbases. For the crypto ecosystem, this signals the return of a serious wave of institutional curiosity—one that could prove longer lasting than the last cycle. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Adoption Spikes Across Industries SUBBD PSG’s treasury announcement has a major cultural impact on the crypto space and among most sports enthusiasts. And if there’s any other space currently undergoing a cultural reset, it’s the creator economy. SUBBD enters this scene with a purpose that goes far deeper than tipping tools or platform gimmicks. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to shift control back into the hands of creators, where the value generated by communities isn’t skimmed by middlemen but retained and grown collectively. SUBBD's native token acts as a currency within a fully integrated ecosystem, supporting creator tokens, community rewards, and governance participation. What elevates this from just another creator token is its commitment to long-term sustainability through a dual-burn and staking protocol, where both creators and fans can lock tokens to influence project direction and receive incentives. In a world where institutions like PSG are leveraging blockchain to connect directly with their audiences, SUBBD’s relevance only increases. Just as PSG is using Bitcoin to realign its financial model with its youthful fanbase, SUBBD is giving online creators a similar mechanism to build loyalty, reward participation, and remain self-sufficient without relying on third-party platforms. This fact was highlighted by top crypto content creator ClayBro in one of his dedicated videos about SUBBD and its potential. If tokenized loyalty is the future of audience engagement, then SUBBD is already building the roads. It doesn’t just fit into a world shifting toward crypto—it builds a necessary bridge between creative energy and economic value. BTC Bull The timing of PSG’s announcement is no coincidence, as it arrives at a moment when Bitcoin has moved from speculative asset to strategic reserve for both companies and now, apparently, elite football clubs. BTC Bull operates on this very principle: that Bitcoin’s importance is no longer theoretical. It’s a financial axis. BTC Bull is a meme-forward project, but beneath its tongue-in-cheek branding lies a calculated reward model. It ties token airdrops and supply burns directly to Bitcoin’s price milestones. The higher BTC climbs, the more it unlocks value for BTC Bull holders. This setup isn’t just fun—it’s incentive engineering based on the most proven crypto asset on the planet. There’s no staking here, no confusing DeFi mazes. BTC Bull thrives on simplicity and strategy. The project doesn’t just comment on Bitcoin’s trajectory—it’s structurally tied to it. With PSG now declaring that BTC is part of its own treasury, Bitcoin-based narratives are gaining cultural gravity. BTC Bull rides that gravity without needing to chase headlines—it lets the market’s natural movements steer its mechanics. What makes BTC Bull relevant now is precisely what made PSG’s move newsworthy. Both rely on Bitcoin not just for storage, but for signaling. As BTC inches toward mainstream institutional acceptance, projects like BTC Bull that embrace its rhythm, rather than mimic unrelated trends, could find their value rise not from hype—but alignment. Snorter As PSG leans into Bitcoin to remain relevant to a digitally fluent fanbase, it makes sense to highlight tools that mirror that efficiency and reach. Snorter is built around that same principle: get closer to users, eliminate friction, and prioritize speed. Snorter is a Solana-based Telegram trading bot that doesn’t just notify—it executes. It was created to solve a very real problem: the delay and fragmentation in how people discover and snipe new tokens. While most traders are stuck switching between listings, wallets, and charts, Snorter keeps everything in one flow inside Telegram, with lightning-fast execution and a clear interface. What makes Snorter particularly potent in this moment is its alignment with changing user behavior. The crypto community, especially the under-30 crowd—the same demographic PSG is actively targeting—is already platform-native. They prefer lightweight, immediate tools over bloated exchanges. Snorter understands that, and delivers. The platform also includes token screening features and curated alerts, making it more than a snipe tool—it’s a mobile-first trading companion. And in an age where legacy brands are integrating blockchain to keep pace with their digital audiences, tools like Snorter represent the infrastructure that makes that connection possible. It’s fast, context-aware, and tuned to the language of the next-gen trader. MIND of Pepe Paris Saint-Germain didn’t just move capital—it made a calculated attempt to connect with a younger, digitally native audience. That same instinct sits at the center of MIND of Pepe , a meme-driven project that’s more than just a nod to internet culture. It’s an AI-powered sentiment engine, constantly plugged into the social web to gauge mood, spot viral energy, and provide real-time market cues to its community. MIND of Pepe operates like a brain for traders in the meme coin space. Instead of relying on slow-moving analytics or gut instinct, the platform’s AI scans posts, discussions, and meme signals across social media to evaluate crowd psychology. It then translates those insights into data traders can act on—often before the market catches on. In a world where branding and timing can create more value than utility alone, MIND of Pepe serves as a toolkit for navigating volatility. It doesn’t just track what’s trending—it tries to understand why it’s trending. That matters in today’s crypto space, where signals move faster than price charts. Presale is over. 👁 $MIND can now be purchased at listing price until launch. https://t.co/YQZ9DDOMKJ pic.twitter.com/zZ9e3LMIH5 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 31, 2025 At the time of writing, the project has completed its presale having raised upwards of $11.9 million, set to hit top exchanges very shortly, with several developmental updates also set to drop in the coming months. PSG’s embrace of innovation through Bitcoin and Web3 ventures validates the need for tools that bridge behavior and technology. MIND of Pepe is building that bridge in the meme coin sector, proving that data-driven intuition and humor aren’t mutually exclusive. If the next bull market is driven as much by narratives as by numbers, MIND of Pepe could become a must-have lens through which many interpret the madness. Solaxy The crypto space is increasingly bifurcated—Ethereum with its institutional adoption and Solana with its performance and accessibility. Solaxy sees this not as a divide to pick sides in, but a rift to bridge. As a Layer 2 solution, it enables fluid interaction between both chains, giving users the speed of Solana and the security of Ethereum without compromising on either. Solaxy doesn’t pitch itself as yet another scaling solution—it positions itself as infrastructure for a future where chains are interoperable and utility is chain-agnostic. On top of its technical foundation, the project also offers high-yield staking via SOLX, its native token, which supports users who want to contribute to network stability while earning passive income. PSG’s entry into Bitcoin investment territory is a reminder that performance and future-proofing go hand in hand. It’s not enough to adopt crypto—you need to make it usable, relevant, and fluid for your audience. Solaxy’s mission reflects that thinking. It doesn’t just offer access to blockchains—it simplifies that access, making it frictionless for developers and investors alike. As more institutions look for entry points into DeFi, and more users demand smooth multichain experiences, Solaxy could play a foundational role. It isn’t waiting for demand to arrive—it’s building the road in anticipation. Best Wallet Token PSG’s Bitcoin treasury isn’t a tech stunt, but rather it’s part of a larger realignment toward digital-first value management. That realignment doesn’t just need assets. It needs tools. Best Wallet Token’s product is one such tool—built not for hype, but for utility that adapts as users evolve. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial wallet that supports transactions across over 60 blockchains. But what separates it from the noise is the depth of its ecosystem. Within the wallet, users can stake, access market insights, browse presales early via the Upcoming Tokens feature, and even manage their entire portfolio—all from one interface. The BEST token serves as more than just a currency within the platform. It provides access to perks, reduced fees, and early access advantages. As crypto adoption spreads from corporations to sports clubs to everyday users, having an intuitive, comprehensive platform matters more than ever. Best Wallet isn’t a niche tool—it’s a hub for navigating crypto without hopping between 10 tabs. Just as PSG restructured its reserves to reflect what the future might look like, Best Wallet gives everyday users a similar recalibration opportunity. It’s not about chasing the next trend—it’s about equipping yourself for everything that comes after. Conclusion We’re no longer in the phase where crypto is just circling the edges of culture. When billion-dollar clubs start locking Bitcoin into their reserves, it’s a cue that the game is changing. The projects above aren’t clinging to old mechanics—they’re building for where things are going next. In times like these, the difference between noise and signal is utility; and these ones speak clearly. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-31T12:40:03,"Pakistan Crypto Council schedules Monday meeting to clarify crypto policy","Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has announced a meeting of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Monday to discuss the confusion surrounding the crypto policy in the country. He wants to discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of the assets. This development comes after members and major stakeholders under his portfolio insisted that digital assets are still banned in the country. The Ministry of Finance released a statement regarding the meeting, noting that it will serve as a “strategic forum to deliberate on the evolving regulatory and legal framework surrounding digital currency and the broader crypto landscape in Pakistan.” Aurangzeb, who is also the chairman of the PCC, is expected to preside over the meeting, with Bilal Bin Saqib, his special assistant on blockchain and crypto also in attendance as the CEO of the council. Pakistan Crypto Council wants to address the legal status of digital assets According to the report, other members of the council will also be in attendance on Monday, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), secretary of the Law and Justice Division, and secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. The council is expected to review several items, which include the development of a regulatory framework to govern digital assets in Pakistan, aligning it with global standards and technological advancements. The main point of the meeting will be to discuss the groundwork to establish the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), a proposed autonomous body to oversee the digital finance and cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council wants to lay a foundation for a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. It also wants to look into the promotion and adoption of responsible blockchain technology, with a view to protect investors and enhance financial inclusion. “The upcoming meeting underscores the government’s commitment to shaping a future-ready financial infrastructure while ensuring stability and compliance in the emerging digital economy,” it added. Internal criticisms fuel the need for clarification The meeting was convened after conflicting signals from several figures within the government. Days ago, the SBP and the Financial Division informed the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that digital assets were banned in the country. It meant that all transactions and ownership of the assets were illegal under certain conditions. Although the SBP has walked back its stance on the assets, some stakeholders are still not sold. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal mentioned that the PCC was formed to look into the crypto policy, noting that the council was formed via an executive order without any legislative backing. He added that under the current SBP and SECP regulations, digital assets are banned in the country. “There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” he said. The executive director of the SBP, Sohail Jawad, also mentioned that the central bank had issued a directive on the legal status of digital assets, noting that its stance that it is illegal remains intact. He also mentioned that the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still recommending crypto-related cases to law enforcement for further action. However, he mentioned that a national working group on digital assets has been formed, and their suggestions will be communicated to the PCC. The parliamentary debate also coincided with the unveiling of the country’s government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the CEO of the PCC, Mr Saqib. According to the official statement from the Ministry of Finance, the unveiling was done in Las Vegas, United States, at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, with United States VP J.D. Vance in attendance. The Pakistan Crypto Council was launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.

2025-05-31T12:36:45,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: What It Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: What It Means for Crypto Bitcoin ETFs saw a big inflow, showing more trust from big players. Find out what this does for crypto trade—and why Bitcoin poker is now hot. The arrival of institutional funds is driving excitement in the world of Bitcoin. It’s amazing that more than $900 million ( 500x increase over the average daily inflow for 2025 so far) was traded in one day, compared to the low daily averages we had this year. This is not a temporary measure—it is clearly a notable indicator. Amidst economic, workforce, and political confusion, the crypto domain is doing very well. Bitcoin did achieve a new high (all-time high) of $112,000 before subsequently falling back to about $108,700—not much decline, but of no consequence in these markets. The technical indicators are overall reflecting a strong return of bullish momentum above $100,000 and the new ultra-high levels of institutional interest that have contributed to the excitement. Institutional Confidence Returns Many institutions have shown a lot more interest in Bitcoin ETFs, proving there is a strong, ongoing trust in this market. After the initial rally at the start of the year, analysts started to rely on ETF inflows to gauge new changes in people’s feelings toward the market. Because of the new injection of funds, Bitcoin’s market cap is now above $2.17 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin does much more than lead the crypto world—it is showing that it is a true competitor for value, like gold and other major assets. Price Volatility Remains The recent rally has had a few hiccups. Bitcoin dipped by 2.5% on the 23rd of May after the surprising announcement from President Donald Trump that he is proposing new tariffs on foreign imports (whether or not this is related is not known officially). His statement shook both the crypto markets and regular markets, but it was short-lived – the buyers entered the markets, and prices stabilized. Experienced crypto holders have seen volatility, but this is still shocking for later holders (particularly those entering via ETFs). 7-day BTC price chart by Coinbase Crypto Infiltrates Other Industries Bitcoin in traditional finance is altering the landscape for complementary industries. Gaming is the sector leading this change. The creation of online gaming focused on blockchain technology and decentralized gambling experiences is a disruption for the industry, especially crypto poker sites , allowing online users to play poker with the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. The advantages for users of these poker sites are apparent: provably fair algorithms, low transaction fees, a payout time of minutes instead of weeks, and user anonymity, an important component for those who are privacy-conscious. Where regular online casinos manage the online gambling market, we have seen crypto poker sites pop up, and the rules that oversee this online gambling vary significantly across countries. Being decentralized and having access to users’ crypto wallets allows these crypto poker platforms to let people play online poker without the usual banking limits, starting new trends in online gaming. The convergence of gaming and finance is indicative that Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are becoming more important. The convergence of DeFi with digital entertainment is clear that cryptocurrency is not limited to earlier adopters and an interested niche, it is becoming broadly accepted. Outlook for the Rest of 2025 Bitcoin continues to cause a stir, and the projections get bolder and bolder. Some analysts are now putting targets around $160,000 for Q4, contingent on regulations being leveled out and inflation continuing to be in check. But honestly, this hype still hinges on larger economic dynamics and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Institutional exposure looks solid, however, it is not a guarantee for success. ETFs basically have become the measuring stick for Bitcoin’s acceptance in mainstream finance. Right now, their actions are being closely examined. There are already Ethereum ETFs, and interest in similar products for Solana and other main cryptos is rising, causing more institutions to enter the crypto world. Prices in Bitcoin and crypto markets are still bouncing around wildly. Even so, large investors are now acknowledging Bitcoin’s role as a true asset class. This development might influence the industry as the years progress.

2025-05-31T12:34:19,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analysts Say $111,000 Was The Launchpad, Price Could Melt Faces At $185,000 By Q3","Analysts have made a bold projection stating that the Bitcoin price could surge from $111,000 to $185,000 by the end of Q3. This prediction follows the Bitcoin price breaking the $111,000 resistance as it continues to build momentum towards a new all-time high. With the Bitcoin price acting as the launchpad for renewed crypto market excitement, investors are shifting their attention to FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a surprisingly well-structured meme token that’s gaining momentum fast. Analysts Call $111,000 The Launchpad For A Bitcoin Price Explosion Toward $185,000 By Q3 Analysts have said the $111,000 mark could serve as the next major launchpad for the Bitcoin price upward trajectory. They believe this level may act as a consolidation zone before the Bitcoin price’s next explosive move. In addition, the founder of 10T Holdings has also issued a bold forecast , stating that the Bitcoin price could surge to a range of $180,000 to $185,000 by Q3 2025. The investor’s prediction further reinforces the idea that institutional capital remains confident in the Bitcoin price’s long-term upside, especially as crypto adoption continues to grow. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Combines Intelligence, Influence, and Explosive Potential FloppyPepe (FPPE) challenges the traditional meme coin narrative by merging internet culture with practical applications, AI advancements, and a vision focused on community-led development. With the token currently priced affordably at $0.00000035, the project is attracting attention from early investors seeking the next major breakout. This emerging presale holds significant potential for transforming investments into considerable profits thanks to its exceptionally low presale price. Investors are rapidly joining in, driven by fear of missing out on anticipated substantial returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Smashes Milestone With Over $2 Million Raised The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has recently surpassed a landmark of $2 million in revenues, reflecting strong confidence among investors. This token employs a tiered pricing method, distinguishing it from the standard pricing strategies commonly used by larger ICOs. Currently, the token is priced at just $0.00000035, offering a cheap entry point. Those who invested during the private round completely sold out within 24 hours, raising nearly $1 million and showcasing robust investor confidence in its growth prospects.

A modest investment of $100 could evolve into $5 million, contingent on market acceptance and listing performance aligning with forecasts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has established a soft cap of $20 million and a hard cap of $45 million, which is ambitious yet achievable given the current appetite in today’s meme-influenced market.

2025-05-31T12:26:02,"SEC forwards plan to freeze budget and trim staff headcount","The SEC is cutting back on staff and locking in its budget for next year. On Friday night, the agency said it’s asking Congress to keep its 2026 funding flat at $2.15 billion, the same amount it received for 2025. Along with the frozen budget, the regulator wants to slash its full-time headcount by nearly 10%, from 4,548 positions down to 4,101. This is one of the agency’s most aggressive decisions to scale down operations since hundreds of employees took early-exit packages over the past few months. According to Reuters , the SEC is bracing for an extended period of tighter operations. It’s already seen a wave of exits this year, with about 600 staff walking away. That exodus hit some departments especially hard. Between 15% and 19% of employees in critical divisions resigned over the span of a few weeks. The agency isn’t replacing them. Instead, it’s planning to keep things lean and work with fewer hands on deck. The current fiscal year ends in September, but this new plan shows the regulator is preparing for deeper structural changes heading into 2026. SEC says no more meme coin policing The SEC’s request for a trimmed workforce and flat budget also comes with a bit of a warning. If Congress dumps more responsibility on the agency, like folding in oversight from a US audit watchdog that could be shut down, the SEC may have to stretch its limited resources even further. That’s why the agency says the flat budget would still leave about $100 million in reserve, to deal with what it calls “a number of uncertainties.” There’s no list of what those are, but the implication is clear: expect more work, not more funding. Chairman Paul Atkins is scheduled to testify before the Senate on Tuesday to explain the numbers and the plan. The agency didn’t offer anything beyond what was already in its public filing. But the budget tells a story by itself: fewer people, same money, and a long list of things to do. Meanwhile, the SEC has officially walked away from meme coins. That decision became public back in February, when the agency declared that most meme coins aren’t securities under US federal law. That move effectively took meme coins off the SEC’s plate and off its radar just weeks after President Donald Trump launched his own coin, $TRUMP . The token exploded in value immediately, boosting Trump’s estimated net worth by billions on paper. Hester Peirce, one of the agency’s longest-serving commissioners, spoke about the decision during the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. In an interview with CNBC, she explained why the SEC is staying out of the meme coin scene. “Here was something where I saw a lot of interest in this out in the world — in meme coins — and it made sense for us to say, ‘People, if you are expecting that there’s SEC protection around these, you should not expect that,’” Peirce said. That approach fits the broader picture. With fewer people, a tight budget, and potential new responsibilities, the SEC is narrowing its focus. Degens looking for guidance or justice against meme coin scams aren’t going to find it here. The agency has moved on. You’re on your own. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The daily chart looks nasty: a series of red candles and a Three Black Crows pattern. The 50-day EMA at $159.60 has flipped from support to resistance, and the MACD momentum indicators are showing widening gaps and deepening red histograms – all bearish. Support levels: $141.60, $125.95, $112.04 Resistance zone: $176-$188 with strong rejection Momentum indicators: MACD bearish, RSI 46 Derivatives Liquidations and ETF Delays Fuel Bearish Sentiment The data shows a shift in sentiment around Solana. According to Coinglass, futures open interest fell 3.23% to $7.11 billion, and long liquidations were $18.98 million on Friday, while short liquidations were just $464,750. This represents a significant unwinding of leveraged long positions. Meanwhile, the delays in US spot Solana ETFs, despite six applications from Fidelity and VanEck, are capping the optimism. Polymarket has the approval odds at 82%, and some analysts, including VirtualBacon, are calling for post-approval targets of $440-$600, similar to Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally. However, until the SEC gives the green light, regaining $200 looks challenging. Institutional Growth and Network Expansion Offer Long-Term Promise; Solana Supported?

Look for support at $141.60; however, unless Solana forms a strong reversal pattern, such as a Hammer or Morning Star with MACD convergence and a retest of the 50 EMA, the path of least resistance remains down. Newbies should wait for clear reversal signals to enter, while experienced traders can look for volume confirmation on a breakdown or reversal. Without bullish momentum, Solana may not retest $200 anytime soon. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $1560, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

2025-05-31T12:00:00,"SEC statement marks break from Gensler era on crypto staking","In a pivotal shift for U.S. crypto policy, the Securities and Exchange Commission clarified on May 29 that most staking activities on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains do not constitute securities transactions—marking a major departure from the agency’s previously aggressive stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. The move, issued in a statement titled “Providing Security is not a ‘Security’,” alleviates legal uncertainty that had long stifled innovation and discouraged American participation in network staking. While the clarification is not a binding rule, it signals a more open regulatory posture under the current administration. It could also unlock significant growth in staking-related infrastructure, which is increasingly central to the operation and decentralization of modern blockchain networks. The SEC’s statement Hester Peirce, the Division of Corporation Finance and Commissioner, essentially captured the essence of the SEC’s approach by explaining that “certain proof-of-stake blockchain protocol ‘staking’ activities are not securities transactions within the scope of the federal securities laws.” Pierse clarifies that staking is a voluntary effort by users to secure a network, but the previous regulatory uncertainty has been discouraging for Americans. This “artificial constraint” harmed decentralization, censorship resistance, and, therefore, the credible neutrality of proof-of-stake-based blockchains. According to the Division of Corporation Finance, the statement applies to various groups of individuals and services, including those who stake assets individually or via the delegated-proof-of-stake platform, as well as staking-as-service providers, both custodial and non-custodial. Furthermore, the commission outlines in the statement that ancillary services associated with staking are not considered a securities offering. As an example of such ancillary services, the commission cites the provision of slashing coverage that returns staked crypto assets before the unbinding period ends, allowing the reward to be recalculated while maintaining the minimum amount of staked assets required for normal network operation. The statement follows the previously issued clarification noting that the SEC doesn’t apply securities offering laws to the mining of cryptocurrency. Generally, the clarification follows the logic of the commission’s other actions and statements made in the post-Gensler era, which began in 2025 when President Donald Trump directed his administration to loosen crypto sector regulation. Read more: Gary Gensler’s political testament. Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview One of the most notable differences was the abandonment of Gensler’s approach of labeling most cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, a status that led to legal battles and, therefore, slower development in the sector. A yet unnoticed victory Crypto Council for Innovation was one of the first to emphasize the importance of the change in the staking status. In a series of X posts, the organization pointed out that the new legal status outlines staking “as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract.” Alison Mangiero, head of staking policy, thanked the SEC for recognizing staking’s real purpose as a tool that provides network security without being a security itself. 1/ Huge win for staking and the wider crypto community. @SECGov now recognizes staking as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract. 👏 @AMangiero @TeamPOSA pic.twitter.com/jTfPq4ihjX — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) May 30, 2025 The shift in attention from wealth accumulation to the structural role of staking in PoS-based networks suggests that U.S. regulators are becoming more open-minded about the cryptocurrency sector. Interestingly, the clarification of staking status news was met with perplexity by many. In the comment sections of the news accounts, people asked if the news was bullish and, if so, why the prices weren’t going up. Some tried to deploy Grok AI to get the answers. One possible reason for such confusion is that Bitcoin and stablecoins largely dominated the 2025 crypto narrative, while proof-of-stake platforms were pushed out of the spotlight in crypto discussions. Ethereum, one of the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems, has been under fire as the Ether price declined throughout the year. “Bitcoin, not crypto,” became a popular motto among many influencers on crypto X. However, staking hasn’t gone anywhere. The staking ratio (a percentage of the supply of the staked crypto to the rest of the circulating supply) continues to grow across various blockchains. The Block indicates that as of Dec. 31, 2024, Ethereum’s staking ratio reached 28%, while other key PoS-based blockchains (i.e., Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot) saw staking ratios over 50%. It signifies a growing investor involvement in staking. Furthermore, the staking sector is undergoing a series of innovations. Mostly, they aim to provide stakers with more flexibility or unlocking liquidity while staking. It makes staking less demanding. Previously, it involved locking up crypto assets for a specified period, which could be unprofitable. The modern-day features help validators avoid missing out on profits while securing the network. The SEC’s clarification on staking may not carry the weight of formal legislation, but it represents a meaningful step toward deregulating the U.S. crypto landscape. While the news has yet to spark a surge in token prices or mainstream attention, it lays critical groundwork for future innovation. As staking continues to evolve—becoming more liquid, accessible, and central to blockchain infrastructure—the ability of U.S.-based users, developers, and service providers to participate without fear of legal ambiguity could catalyze a new wave of decentralization and growth. In short, the stakes have changed.

2025-05-31T11:51:40,"Crypto Billionaire Justin Sun Set for Space Flight? Blue Origin’s Tweet Sparks Buzz","The post Crypto Billionaire Justin Sun Set for Space Flight? Blue Origin’s Tweet Sparks Buzz appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a leading crypto billionaire, is about to make history by flying to space with Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. A recent tweet exchange between Sun and Blue Origin has sparked excitement, hinting that his suborbital flight on the New Shepard rocket is coming soon. Hello @justinsuntron We look forward to seeing you in West Texas on a future New Shepard flight soon! https://t.co/jnBbcjHBAn — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) May 30, 2025 If this happens, Sun will be the first person from the crypto world to travel to space, showing how blockchain and space exploration can come together. A $28 Million Ticket to Space In 2021, Justin Sun won a charity auction by bidding $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard flight. The money went to Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, a foundation that supports 19 space-related charities focused on inspiring future generations in STEM fields. Though the flight was originally planned for 2022, it was delayed. But on May 29, 2025, Sun posted a tweet from inside a spacecraft simulator, suggesting the trip is back on. The flight might take place in July 2025, according to recent announcements, and Sun will fly with five other crewmates, including someone who won their seat with a $6 million ticket. Flying with a Star-Studded Crew Justin Sun won’t be traveling alone. He’ll be joined by five others, making this an exciting mission that combines the worlds of space and crypto. This group will mark a new chapter in how cryptocurrency interacts with space technology. Justin Sun in the Spotlight Sun has a history of making big headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.5 million to have a charity lunch with famous investor Warren Buffett. At that lunch, Sun brought top crypto figures like Litecoin’s Charlie Lee and eToro’s CEO Yonni Assia. Even though Buffett remains skeptical about Bitcoin, the meeting sparked important discussions about cryptocurrency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto’s Satoshi Nakamoto Overtakes Bill Gates as Bitcoin Hits New Highs , In 2025, Sun continued his high-profile appearances by attending a dinner with Donald Trump for top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin . He also met crypto leaders like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss twins at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. These actions highlight Sun’s efforts to raise TRON’s profile and influence in the crypto space. How Does The Crypto Community See This? The crypto community on X has been buzzing about Sun’s space plans. Influencer Wendy O said, “Justin is taking us to the moon,” celebrating this milestone. Others believe this trip could boost TRON’s visibility and push the crypto industry toward exciting new innovations. This mission may increase TRON’s visibility and inspire blockchain leaders to think bigger as the crypto world gets ready to reach new heights. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T11:48:50,"Shiba Inu price crashes as whales sell, burn rate slows","Shiba Inu price continued its strong downtrend on Saturday as whale investors sold and sentiment in the crypto industry worsened. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the biggest meme coin in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) chain, dropped for four consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.00001238, its lowest level since April 22. It has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. SHIB has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that SHIB whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion. Whale selling is a sign that they expect its price to keep falling. Shiba Inu whales are selling | Source: Santiment Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well as its total value locked stands at just $2.92 million. In contrast, Unichain , which Uniswap ( UNI ) launched earlier this year, has a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. The single biggest burn this week was an 18 million transaction that happened on Wednesday. It was common for SHIB to have over 1 billion burns a few months ago. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00001755 on May 12 as cryptocurrencies rallied. It then embarked on a strong downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001235, its lowest point since April 22. It has moved below the 50-day moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge is a bearish pattern comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next target being the year-to-date low of $0.00001033, down by 16% from the current level.

2025-05-31T11:45:51,"US Government May Be Forced To Impose Widespread ‘Financial Repression’ To Keep $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Burden Manageable: UBS","The global wealth manager UBS says that the US government’s massive $36.2 trillion debt burden may cause it to take more extreme financial measures. In a new report, UBS says that the US government may be forced to make its growing debt burden more manageable by turning to additional financial repression measures that would artificially lower the yield on government bonds. “We expect that, over the longer term, the US government may pursue both fiscal consolidation and financial repression – a phenomenon that already exists in some form in the US and many other countries – to contain yields and keep the high debt burden manageable.” One potential financial repression measure may be to reform the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks, according to UBS. “Presently, large US banks must hold equity capital against all assets, including high-quality ones like Treasuries. Loosening the SLR could be justified as supporting bank lending, but excluding Treasuries from capital requirements would incentivize banks to hold more Treasuries, potentially enhancing market liquidity.” UBS says the US is well-positioned to successfully implement financial repression measures, as long as they are put in place on a temporary basis. “For a country as large and wealthy as the US, widespread financial repression seems feasible and could enable the government to continue financing a growing debt burden without materially increasing its risk of default. Financial repression policies could be deployed temporarily to provide fiscal breathing room, allowing for budget consolidation and improvement, followed by a phase-out and a return to more conventional policy settings. In such a scenario, economic distortions should remain temporary and manageable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
