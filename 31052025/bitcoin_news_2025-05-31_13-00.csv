2025-05-31T10:46:57,"Stablecoins dominate the conversation at Bitcoin 2025","Stablecoins were the headline story at Bitcoin 2025 this week in Las Vegas, not Bitcoin. The three-day event, which pulled in a crowd of 35,000, saw major political names and crypto executives focusing heavily on dollar-pegged tokens, not the coin that started it all. According to CNBC, what dominated the stage was a growing political alliance pushing legislation to bring stablecoins into the core of US financial power. Vice President JD Vance showed up to deliver a full public endorsement of the space, becoming the first VP to speak directly to Bitcoiners. “I think it’s wrong, actually, to call this just a conference,” JD told attendees. “This is a movement. And I’m proud to stand with you.” JV also made it clear the White House now sees stablecoins as an asset. “We do not think that stablecoins threaten the integrity of the US dollar. Quite the opposite,” he said. “We view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.” Congress pushes stablecoin bill as GOP sets deadline Bo Hines, who runs the president’s Digital Assets Council, said stablecoin rails are being streamlined to secure the US dollar’s dominance “for decades to come.” Bo told CNBC the White House believes this could unlock trillions of dollars in demand for American debt from global buyers. The entire playbook is tied to a new bill, the GENIUS Act, now heading to the floor of the US Senate. Senator Cynthia Lummis told the crowd that a deal had been reached after weeks of negotiations with Democrats. “We think we have a final deal,” Cynthia said. “If we can get this passed, this will be the first piece of digital asset legislation to pass the US Senate.” A cloture vote is expected Monday. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer praised Senator Bill Hagerty for speeding up what he called a “calcified” Senate and said Republicans want to get both the stablecoin and market structure bills to President Donald Trump’s desk before August recess. “The president promised this,” Tom said. “We want it done now.” Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, said the stablecoin bill will reach the House Financial Services Committee by July. Bryan said it would allow issuers to buy US Treasuries at a crucial moment. “It enshrines the US dollar in our dominant role as the world’s reserve currency,” he said. Bryan also dismissed Democratic efforts to add an amendment that would block government officials from benefiting from stablecoin companies. That clause was reportedly aimed at the Trump family, who are linked to World Liberty Financial, the firm behind the new USD1 token. Tether expands while Wall Street builds competition The biggest issuer in the stablecoin space right now is Tether, and its CEO Paolo Ardoino said the next big use case will come from commodity traders, not banks. Paolo said Tether is ready for what’s next. “All the traditional financial firms will create stablecoins that will be offered to their existing customers,” he told CNBC. But he argued those firms are boxed in by their own high-fee business models. Instead of chasing wealthy users, Paolo said Tether is focusing on reaching the global majority who don’t have access to banks. “Many of our competitors say, ‘Oh, Tether is serving this niche of the unbanked.’ Half of the population of the world should not be called a niche,” he said. While Paolo was onstage in Vegas, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are in early talks to launch a joint digital dollar to compete directly with Tether. The battle between legacy finance and crypto-native firms is now on-chain. Kraken CEO Dave Ripley, who’s been in private talks with lawmakers, told CNBC the bill is critical to bringing big banks and brokers into the space. But he said there are still issues to resolve, like whether users can earn yield and what rules apply to politicians investing in stablecoin companies. “Crypto is all about individuals,” Dave said. “Let’s bring the value to them.” There’s also a loud change happening at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency once seen as the crypto world’s biggest problem. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said change was overdue. “For many years now, I’ve been complaining about the fact that the commission has not taken proactive steps to provide clarity,” Hester said. “Now finally, we’re at a place where we can do that.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-2025-stablecoins-overshadowed-btc/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT","News|BTC|USDC|USDT",cryptocompare

As of press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $103,555, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen a modest correction of about 0.14%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Turning to price predictions, Finbold consulted both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for insights into how the asset will likely trade by June 30. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price For starters, ChatGPT suggested that Bitcoin’s strong momentum could continue into the next month, with a base-case prediction of $118,000 by June 30, 2025. The model highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience at this level, backed by the possibility of renewed bullish sentiment. ChatGPT also noted that historical seasonality offers mixed clues, as June has seen pre-summer rallies and notable corrections in past years. At the same time, the broader macroeconomic environment could also play a key role. If global liquidity conditions improve or central banks cut rates, Bitcoin might benefit from increased capital inflows. The model also pointed to key technical resistance levels expected between $110,000 and $120,000, but if Bitcoin breaks through, a price as high as $130,000 becomes plausible. On the flip side, should Bitcoin face resistance or market sentiment sour, it could retreat to $98,000. ChatGPT estimates there’s a 65% chance that Bitcoin will finish June above $110,000, though breaking $130,000 would likely require a major bullish catalyst. Bitcoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok offered a more tempered outlook. Based on Bitcoin’s current price and historical volatility, Grok predicts that Bitcoin will trade around $108,000 by June 30. This assumes continued bullish sentiment supported by institutional inflows and favorable regulatory developments. However, Grok also pointed out that resistance near $110,000 could temper the rally, with a plausible range between $105,000 and $112,000. A pullback to around $95,000 is possible if Bitcoin’s momentum stalls. In summary, both AI models suggest Bitcoin is likely to remain above the $100,000 mark by the end of June 2025, with the potential to break higher if favorable conditions emerge. Indeed, as Bitcoin enters June, the asset is witnessing increased institutional demand , with several entities adding the asset to their treasuries. To this end, some analysts believe the move will likely create a supply shock and drive the asset’s price higher.

2025-05-31T10:35:40,"Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation","The post Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Public companies have accumulated more Bitcoin than U.S. spot ETFs over the past three quarters, signaling long-term strategic adoption. MicroStrategy leads with 580,250 BTC as corporate holdings reach 757,593 BTC, marking a structural shift in Bitcoin ownership dynamics. Publicly traded companies are steadily becoming major players in Bitcoin accumulation, surpassing even spot ETFs in net additions over recent quarters. Unlike the highly reactive nature of ETF flows, these corporate purchases are long-term, often held on balance sheets as strategic assets. Public Companies Are Buying More BTC Than ETFs According to a post by respected crypto analyst Ecoinometrics , public companies have added more Bitcoin to their balance sheets over the past three quarters than U.S. spot ETFs. These sustained purchases suggest a trend of structural demand, as corporate treasuries continue accumulating BTC with a long-term outlook. How Much Bitcoin Do Public Companies Hold? Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies now hold 757,593 BTC , valued at approximately $78.67 billion , representing 3.6% of the total BTC supply . Top 5 Public BTC Holders (by Market Cap): MicroStrategy : 580,250 BTC (~$60.25B) Marathon Digital Holdings : 48,237 BTC (~$5B) Riot Platforms : 19,211 BTC (~$1.99B) CleanSpark : 12,101 BTC (~$1.26B) Tesla : 11,509 BTC (~$1.19B) MicroStrategy remains the leader, purchasing an additional 133,988 BTC this year alone, with 26,695 BTC added in just the last month. Other notable increases in 2025 include: Marathon : +7,802 BTC Riot : +2,483 BTC CleanSpark : +2,804 BTC Tesla : +1,789 BTC These figures reflect growing institutional confidence in BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Spot ETF Holdings: Bigger, But More Volatile While public companies lead in new accumulation, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still hold more overall BTC. The top 12 ETFs combined hold 1,211,938 BTC , valued at around $125.85 billion , accounting for 5.77% of total BTC supply. Top 5 Spot Bitcoin ETFs: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) : 664,954.7 BTC (~$69.05B) Fidelity Wise Origin (FBTC) : 198,291 BTC (~$20.59B) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) : 186,706.1 BTC (~$19.39B) ARK 21Shares (ARKB) : 47,152.2 BTC (~$4.9B) Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) : 43,690.1 BTC (~$4.54B) However, ETF flows have been more mixed this year: IBIT : +113,036.1 BTC FBTC : -2,872 BTC GBTC : -18,692.8 BTC ARKB : +545.1 BTC Mini Trust : +5,677.2 BTC These fluctuations highlight the more reactive nature of ETFs compared to corporate treasury strategies. Why Corporate BTC Accumulation Matters Unlike ETFs that may adjust holdings based on short-term investor sentiment, corporations typically treat Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. This difference matters: ETFs = Liquidity-driven, reactive to market trends Public Companies = Sticky, long-term holders The result: corporate accumulation gradually removes BTC from circulation, creating structural demand that can support long-term price growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Bitcoin Market Snapshot Here’s how Bitcoin has performed recently: Timeframe Price Change Last 6 Months +7.52% Year-to-Date +11.1% Last 30 Days +8.99% Last 14 Days +0.25% Last 7 Days -4.09% Last 24 Hours -1.49% Final Thoughts As public companies continue to increase their BTC holdings quietly but consistently, their role in shaping Bitcoin’s long-term market structure is becoming more significant. These moves may not generate the daily headlines that ETF launches do—but they represent a foundational shift in Bitcoin’s role as a treasury asset. The next time volatility strikes, it might be the public companies—not ETFs—that provide the bedrock of long-term support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T10:32:45,"Meme Coins Just Got a Green Light – 3 Tokens Ready to Explode as the SEC Backs Off","Something strange just happened in crypto, and it might be the beginning of the biggest meme coin run we’ve seen yet. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aka the fun police of finance, just raised the white flag. In a surprise twist, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said the agency is backing off regulating meme coins like $TRUMP. That’s like removing the leash from a hyperactive Shiba Inu – expect chaos, excitement, and some serious gains. To make things even wilder, Donald Trump just posted a $PEPE meme on Truth Social. If the former president is embracing meme culture, you can bet the rest of the world is watching. Retail investors, whales, and degens alike are licking their lips. If regulation backs off and hype takes over, it could mean a perfect storm for meme coins. Let’s dive into what’s happening and look at three of the new crypto projects ready to blow. A Big Shift for Meme Coins For years, meme coins lived in a legal gray zone. The SEC looked at them with suspicion , sometimes lumping them in with scams and shady tokens. But now? According to Hester Peirce, the agency is stepping away. She believes investors should be free to take meme coin risks without the SEC breathing down their necks. That might sound like small news, but it’s actually massive. Fewer regulatory hurdles mean meme coins can grow, attract funding, and even flirt with mainstream acceptance. Combine that with Trump’s $PEPE post, and it’s clear – meme coins aren’t just a joke anymore. They’re a movement. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The Meme Coin with a Brain, a Blockchain, and a Frog Solaxy ($SOLX) is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. It’s fast, it’s scalable, and it features the internet’s favorite frog, Pepe. As Donald Trump drops $PEPE memes and the SEC backs off meme coin regulation, Solaxy steps into the spotlight with perfect timing. This isn’t just hype – it’s a headline-backed rocket. $SOLX is the first-ever Layer 2 for Solana, solving its biggest headaches – congestion, failed transactions, and poor scalability. It combines Solana’s speed and low fees with Ethereum’s deep liquidity. It’s a multichain meme monster, perfect for traders who want sniper-level performance and actual infrastructure behind their gains. Currently in presale at $0.00174, over $42M has already been raised, with just 16 days left. Analysts predict $SOLX could hit $0.032 in 2025 – that’s an impressive 1,738% increase from today’s price. If you bought $1,000 worth right now at $0.00174, you’d get around 574,713 tokens. Stake those at 15% APY, and in one year, you’d be holding approximately 660,920 tokens. At today’s price that’s $1,150. At the 2025 prediction – over $21K. That’s the kind of math that breaks brains – and breaks out into bull markets. Get in and buy $SOLX before the 16-day fuse runs out. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Meme Machine That Bets on Bitcoin With the SEC backing off and Trump sharing Pepe memes, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is in the perfect spot to explode with the next $BTC breakout. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme coin tailored for Bitcoin maxis and retail traders who want more than just price speculation. Instead of riding the meme wave blindly, $BTCBULL ties its value directly to Bitcoin’s climb toward $1M. As $BTC hits major milestones – like $150K or $200K – holders are rewarded with real Bitcoin payouts, and the token’s supply is reduced through strategic burns, increasing scarcity and value. But here’s the catch: to receive these Bitcoin rewards, you need to buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . It’s a simple rule – no Best Wallet, no airdrops. At just $0.00254, and with over $6.6M raised in crypto presale , $BTCBULL is gaining traction fast. Thanks to a partnership with Best Wallet, even crypto newbies can receive $BTC rewards easily – no need for technical setups or confusing wallets. As the political stage embraces memes and the regulators back off, $BTCBULL is perfectly positioned to ride the wave. It’s not just a meme – it’s a high-voltage, reward-powered tribute to the most dominant asset in crypto history. If you believe in Bitcoin, this might be the most fun (and rewarding) way to bet big. 3. Pepe ($PEPE) – From Meme Mayhem to Market Momentum Pepe ($PEPE) began as pure internet chaos – a token with no roadmap, no whitepaper, and no promise of utility. Just a green frog, a tight-knit community, and a mission to ride the meme wave as far as it could go. And it worked. Within weeks of launch, $PEPE exploded in popularity, landing listings on major exchanges and drawing attention from every corner of Crypto X. But $PEPE hasn’t stayed static. The project now has a roadmap focused on long-term growth, including token burns, liquidity enhancements, and community governance features. It’s not just a frog anymore – it’s a full-blown movement. At a current price of $0.00001127, $PEPE is well below its all-time high, making it an attractive re-entry point for traders looking to ride the next meme coin cycle. With the SEC stepping away from meme coin crackdowns and mainstream figures like Trump posting Pepe content, the timing couldn’t be better. The meme coin space just got political – and Pepe is sitting right at the center of the chaos. Meme Coins Are Free – And That Means They Might Fly When the rules loosen, creativity explodes. Meme coins are weird, risky, and often ridiculous – but that’s exactly why they work. With the SEC backing off, and big names like Trump helping normalize the madness, we’re looking at a perfect storm for a meme coin breakout. Solaxy ($SOLX) enters the scene as the first-ever Solana Layer 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) taps into Bitcoin bullishness with meme energy. And Pepe ($PEPE) is pure, unfiltered internet hype. All three are buzzing right now, and they could ride this new regulatory freedom straight to the moon. Remember that meme coins are highly volatile.

Experts Predict $10 to $23 Rally by Year-End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP could be gearing up for a major breakout. Experts predict that XRP could go as high as $10 by the year’s end. In an interview with Altcoin Daily , crypto analyst George Tung, the founder of CryptosRUs, said that he sees XRP hitting between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. He pointed to XRP’s ability to survive multiple market cycles and its solid fundamentals as the key reasons for his bold prediction. $8–$10 Targets Just the Start? Tung called the $8-$10 a conservative estimate for XRP. The rising institutional interest with several XRP ETFs in the making are key catalyst, he said. If the ETFs are approved, it could unlock massive demand and push XRP much higher in this cycle. XRP’s strong fundamentals make it a safer bet for new investors, compared to the hype driven meme-coins. He also shared his broader outlook and expects Bitcoin to climb 1.5x to 2x, Ethereum 3x to 4x, and sees XRP’s 4x to 5x potential as realistic, especially if market sentiment improves and altcoin liquidity returns. He predicts Bitcoin could peak between $200K and $300K this cycle. Focus on Strong Projects, Limit Risky Bets He was asked if $1000 could be turned to $100,000 by year-end, to which Tung warned against chasing huge gains without understanding the risks. While memecoins like Pepe have made headlines, Tung noted that those big wins are rare now. He recommends users to put most of their money into solid, proven projects and allot just 5-10% for risky plays like memecoin. Bullish Predictions Lately, XRP skeptics have also changed their take on XRP. Davinci Jeremie, who once called XRP ‘worthless,’ now sees strong institutional interest and believes it could hit $24. Virtual Bacon sees a buying opportunity for XRP, but only if it drops 20% or more compared to Bitcoin. He says this could play out in two ways: XRP falls while Bitcoin stays steady, or Bitcoin pumps and XRP lags. Both cases could push XRP into a strong value range. He calls it a classic mid-cycle pattern that often surprises the market. XRP researcher SMQKE thinks XRP could beat Ethereum this year and go up to at least $6. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, expects XRP to rise to $13 or even $22, based on strong signs from its yearly price chart. Dark Defender says XRP is making a new pattern on the weekly chart that could push it up to $18.22 to $23.20 soon. He called $5.85 a key mid-level to watch and said this move matches their previous targets and a pattern from November 2024. He also shared that there may be some resistance along the way.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/xrp-set-for-big-gains-experts-predict-10-to-23-rally-by-year-end/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Uncategorized|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-05-31T10:00:00,"For Everyone Who Said ‘I Should Have Bought Bitcoin Earlier’ – Bitcoin Solaris is Your Time Machine Moment","You’ve heard the stories. The early believers who bought Bitcoin at $0.10 and watched it soar to thousands. Today, that moment seems like a legend—something that passed you by. But what if you had a second chance? What if you could go back in time… and this time, do it right? A growing number of crypto veterans believe that moment is here again, just in a new form. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and it’s quietly becoming one of the most serious contenders for the next generational wealth wave. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just a Coin Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s building on its core—scarcity, decentralization, and security—but reshaping it for scalability, sustainability, and utility. Imagine Bitcoin if it was launched today, designed for mobile-first users, equipped with smart contract functionality, and cross-chain compatibility baked in from day one. With a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, BTC-S mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity but adds layers of innovation that make it usable in today’s fast-paced DeFi world. From the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which will allow users to mine directly from mobile phones , to enterprise-ready smart contracts, BTC-S is gearing up to dominate across sectors. How Bitcoin Solaris Delivers at Lightning Speed Unlike the original Bitcoin network, which can struggle under transaction load, Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) for decentralization and security. The Solaris Layer, on the other hand, uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for rapid speed and minimal energy use. Performance Highlights: Base Layer: Up to 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer: Up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Smart contracts written in Rust Uses Solana’s tooling and Proof-of-History to accelerate adoption And yes—the Solaris Nova app will allow anyone with a smartphone to participate in mobile mining, creating daily income from something already in your hand. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a structured tokenomics model that reflects both fairness and forward-thinking strategy. 66.66% for mining rewards over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% each for development, community, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This balanced approach ensures long-term community alignment while incentivizing adoption and growth at every stage. Presale Frenzy: The Final Hours of This Phase Today marks the last day of the current presale phase, with BTC-S still priced at just $5 . With a launch price of $20, early backers are looking at a potential 1,900% return. The presale is exploding—over 11,000 unique users have already joined, raising more than $1.8 million. Why the buzz? Because this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market, with less than 9 weeks left until launch. Momentum is building—and fast. And if you want to stay plugged in? The project is active across platforms like Telegram and X , where real-time updates and conversations are heating up. A Word on Trust and Community Validation Security is critical. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone dual smart contract audits, one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins . In addition, a full KYC verification has been completed, increasing investor confidence as the ecosystem grows. In addition, crypto enthusiasts are already calling this “the one they won’t miss again.” A detailed review by Crypto Volt breaks down exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from investors, influencers, and analysts alike. And judging by the community energy, this could be just the beginning. Conclusion: You Wished for a Do-Over—Now It’s Here Bitcoin at ten cents felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. But every cycle brings new chances to those who are watching closely. Bitcoin Solaris offers more than a coin—it offers a complete, scalable, and decentralized platform primed for growth. This might just be your time machine moment.

2025-05-31T09:46:36,"Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. In crypto and web3, money can be created, lost, or multiplied within seconds. It’s the polar opposite of old money, which grew slowly, accruing value over years or even decades. Crypto accelerates that, posting double-digit moves before TradFi wakes up and has breakfast. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion This hyper-cycle of onchain value creation—and eradication—compels us to reconsider what money truly is and how it functions in a decentralized future. While traditional money was based on nation-states and central banks, web3 money is founded on code, consensus, and community belief. It writes its own rules—and then forces the rest of the world to follow along. Not because they have to, but because if they don’t, they risk being left behind. It’s a case of innovate or die. And right now, web3 is doing most of the innovating as it reimagines what money is capable of achieving—and who it achieves it for. In this new environment, capital is not just capital: it represents culture, software, and storytelling. Value is digital, 24/7 tradable, and accessible to everyone, not just the suits in their glass towers. The future of finance is being rapidly built before our eyes, and mastering this transformation calls for rewriting the rulebook on what money means. A generation of digital natives is growing up, to whom money doesn’t mean checking accounts and 401 Ks—it means self-custodied stablecoins, yield-producing assets, and collectibles that can command eye-watering prices. Navigating this future calls for viewing money through five new perspectives. Reimagining money First, money has become a networked belief. In crypto, money is no longer issued by governments but created through consensus. Bitcoin ( BTC ) represents trust in a limited supply and decentralization, while Ethereum ( ETH ) shows faith in programmable agreements. Even memecoins demonstrate that stories, viral spread, and community engagement can generate market value without practical utility. In this system, value grows with belief. Money becomes a network effect: a shared idea we all participate in. We know why Bitcoin is valuable: because it’s hard to obtain, has a fixed supply, and is secured by the world’s largest decentralized network. But precious as these attributes are, Bitcoin’s value ultimately comes down to a shared, networked belief. We believe it is precious, and hundreds of millions of others share our conviction, so Number Go Up. Second, money functions as infrastructure rather than status. In traditional finance, wealth is the goal. In web3, it serves as a tool to build ecosystems, coordinate communities, and motivate action. Tokens fund development. DAOs direct capital toward common goals. NFTs serve as programmable access layers, not just collectibles. Here, money works as infrastructure: it is a tool, not a trophy. It’s the means, not the endgame. It’s often said that money doesn’t buy happiness—merely freedom of choice. What is crypto if not the ultimate embodiment of that concept? Freedom to build; freedom to collaborate; freedom to buy and sell anything, any time, to anyone. Third, money exists as a transparent flow. Blockchain technology makes every transaction visible. Unlike traditional systems hidden behind intermediaries, on-chain finance transforms money into traceable, verifiable movement. This creates a new dynamic: behavior becomes observable, and economic patterns become public. It makes us think about not just how money moves, but why. The important question becomes: What does this movement reveal about our true values? The psychology of money Fourth, money operates as a temporal illusion. Crypto’s volatility shows an important truth: value is not fixed; it’s constructed. In web3, fortunes appear or disappear in minutes. This volatility affects both finances and psychology. It teaches us that money does not equal security but represents a constantly changing narrative. This instability requires humility, not exaggeration. Quick profits may come easily, but their real cost often becomes apparent later. As the bitcoiners’ mantra goes, “Stay humble and stack sats.” In other words, don’t flaunt your wealth: be grateful for what you’ve got and keep quietly adding to it if your conviction in its value remains undiminished. Finally, money functions as a moral code. Programmable money allows us to embed values directly into code. Incentive structures can reward transparency, collaboration, environmental protection, or long-term contribution, not just speculation. This means web3 gives us the unique opportunity to design moral money—money that reflects shared principles, not just market forces. In the web3 era, money isn’t merely what you possess: it’s what you help create. It reflects collective belief, functions as a programmable social layer, and serves as a tool that can either strengthen or weaken the values we care about. This is why astute web3 VCs invest not only in technical innovation but in value-aligned ecosystems. Because if we can redesign financial infrastructure, we also have the responsibility to ask: what kind of world should it serve? Let’s not just earn money. Let’s reimagine it.

2025-05-31T09:45:22,"XRP Big Holder Says He Won’t Sell Until This Price","Edoardo Farina, a cryptocurrency proponent and founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has laid out a personal plan for managing his XRP holdings. This plan contrasts with the short-term strategies followed by many investors. Rather than seeking immediate returns, Farina aims to retain most of his position until the token’s value reaches triple-digit territory. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, and while this is much lower than Farina’s long-term objective, he remains focused on future milestones, with his approach centered on value retention, selective profit-taking, and long-term utility through decentralized finance. A Milestone to Celebrate Growth Farina does not intend to sell a substantial portion of his XRP, even when the token reaches higher valuations. He has previously warned community members not to sell their tokens at current levels and explained in his video that his first small sale will occur when the asset hits $10, a point he considers suitable for locking in a minor percentage of gains. According to him, this step is not an exit but rather a way to celebrate progress and redirect some funds into real estate investments, particularly in Greece, where he has already been active with proceeds from other cryptocurrencies. He also shared how his holdings are managed. The vast majority of his XRP is stored offline in cold wallets, with only a small portion held on exchanges for liquidity purposes. He recently drew attention to the Mt. Gox collapse that ruined the lives of many Bitcoin holders and warned XRP holders to move their tokens off centralized exchanges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Taking Profit at Future Price Levels Farina revealed that he would sell some tokens at $50, but noted that the scale would be modest. The next target is $100 , and Farina has explained that selling just 1,000 tokens at this price would bring in $100,000. Farina argued that withdrawing the original capital investment is a sound practice in risk management, but insisted that the majority of his tokens will not be sold. A Better Option than Selling Farina’s ultimate goal does not involve liquidation but rather participation in lending opportunities once the legal framework for XRP becomes more defined. He believes that lending XRP through regulated platforms will allow investors to earn yield in stablecoins, fiat currencies, or even XRP itself. Other experts have also advocated for this approach , as they expect large-scale institutional adoption once all regulatory issues are resolved. While some experts believe XRP may not hit $100 until the next decade, Farina remains unfazed, emphasizing long-term utility and passive income potential. He advises strategic selling, not reacting to short-term price shifts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-05-31T09:38:59,"Nigel Farage Vows Pro-Crypto Bill, Bitcoin Reserve If Elected UK PM","Key Takeaways: Nigel Farage pledged to pass a pro-crypto bill cutting taxes and creating a Bitcoin reserve if elected UK prime minister. The bill would also ban banks from denying services to crypto users, addressing concerns over “debanking.” The UK plans to enforce mandatory crypto trade reporting from January 2026 to boost tax compliance. Nigel Farage, leader of Britain’s Reform Party, has thrown his full backing behind cryptocurrency, unveiling an ambitious pro-crypto legislative plan at this year’s Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Taking the stage on Thursday , Farage promised that if elected prime minister in the UK’s next general election, scheduled for 2029, his government would champion crypto-friendly reforms. Waving a draft of the proposed “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” Farage declared, “We will campaign for this and we will put it in place when we win the next general election… Bring crypto and digital assets in from the cold.” UK Bill Proposes 10% Crypto Tax The proposed bill would significantly lower capital gains tax on crypto from the current 24% to 10%, mandate that the Bank of England create a Bitcoin reserve, and prohibit banks from denying services to individuals or businesses based on their crypto-related activities. The practice of so-called “debanking” has become a flashpoint in both political and crypto circles. Farage himself has claimed he was denied bank accounts for political reasons, a grievance he leveraged to connect with the conference’s audience. “I went to 10 banks, all of whom refused me an account,” Farage told the crowd. “No wonder so many people are going for Bitcoin—because they can’t close you down, and that is the ultimate freedom.” Farage is no stranger to controversy. He previously led UKIP, the driving force behind Brexit, and has long been a polarizing figure in British politics. The Reform Party, his current platform, has faced its own accusations of racism, which party leaders have denied. On Thursday, Farage also announced that the Reform Party now accepts crypto donations via its website, supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC). Let’s get the British economy into the 21st century. Read Reform UK’s Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill. https://t.co/5QytUV1p1V pic.twitter.com/pfqdAxhHPe — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) May 30, 2025 The party’s pro-crypto push aligns with a growing global trend among right-wing parties embracing digital assets. In recent years, politicians in the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina have advanced similar initiatives, linking crypto’s decentralization ethos with broader anti-establishment narratives. Farage closed his speech by appealing to the conference audience, framing the Reform Party’s crypto-friendly stance as part of a larger fight for financial freedom. “It’s about freedom and control of your own money,” he said, “and that’s what we stand for.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-05-31T09:36:51,"Mounting Evidence of Ethereum’s Struggles: Volatility, ETF Losses, Weak Demand","Ether’s price has been struggling to break above the $2,750 resistance level, despite rising by over 44% this month. Now, several evidence point to the altcoin’s struggles throughout the 2023-25 cycle, which revealed both volatility and capital flow patterns that contrast sharply with prior cycles and competitor assets like Bitcoin and Solana. Ethereum Faces Significant Headwinds One of the most notable indicators is Ether’s realized volatility, which has compressed across cycles as the asset’s size grows, currently hovering around 80%, down from over 120% in earlier periods, according to Glassnode’s latest report . Typically, Ether’s 3-month realized volatility rises during bull markets and falls during bearish trends. However, this cycle has defied that pattern. In fact, after reaching 60% at the mid-2024 peak of roughly $4,000, realized volatility surprisingly climbed above 90% even as the price declined toward $1,500. This atypical increase in volatility amid falling prices signals increased market uncertainty and instability. Moreover, while the drawdown structure in this cycle generally aligns with the typical Ether bull market pattern – where corrections of 40% or more from local peaks are common – the key deviation lies in the absence of a fresh ATH price for the altcoin, unlike Bitcoin and Solana, both of which set new peaks in this cycle. This lack of a new high has been a disappointment for many investors who expected the world’s second-largest crypto asset to track more closely with its peers. Additionally, Ether’s downside price movements have been unusually volatile, with multiple drawdowns exceeding 40% and the current 2025 drawdown peaking at an unusually severe 65.4%. While previous cycles have seen similar or worse drawdowns, they tended to occur later in the cycle. As such, this early, steep correction suggests structural weaknesses unique to this period. In terms of capital inflows, the Realized Cap – a measure of the value of all Ether based on the price at which coins last moved – has increased by only 38% since the cycle low in January 2023, growing from $176 billion to $243 billion. This pales in comparison to the massive growth during the 2021 cycle, which saw more than a 1,000% increase. The relatively muted capital inflow of approximately $67 billion during this cycle underlines weaker liquidity support and helps explain the crypto asset’s subdued price performance. Supporting this narrative, trade activity on major centralized exchanges has mirrored these trends: spot volume, which peaked at $14.7 billion per day during the $4,000 price high in December 2024, plunged by roughly 80% to $2.9 billion per day. Though recent trading volumes have rebounded to $8.6 billion daily, spot volumes have yet to establish new cycle highs, as seen with previous cycles. Average ETH ETF investor Substantially Underwater The firm’s analysis further revealed that the average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately 21%. Net outflows from these ETFs have tended to accelerate whenever Ethereum’s spot price drops below the average cost basis, observed during important declines in August 2024 and again in January and March 2025. Despite initial excitement, the ETFs accounted for only around 1.5% of spot market trade volume at launch, pointing to a lukewarm reception. While this rose to over 2.5% in November 2024, it has since reverted back to 1.5%.

2025-05-31T09:31:12,"Crypto Bulls Rack up $600M Liquidations as Bitcoin Drops Under $104K","Crypto markets saw a wave of liquidations in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) prices slipped under $104,000, triggering over $600 million in forced closures of bullish futures positions to mark the highest losses since February. A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows. Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi. While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters . Trump’s move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations. The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day. Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/31/crypto-bulls-rack-up-600m-liquidations-as-bitcoin-drops-under-104k,"ASIA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL","Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-31T09:15:36,"Bitcoin Is Still in a Strong Bullish Trend Despite Losing Major Support Level, Says Trader – Here’s His Outlook","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) amid a recent correction. The trader pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is still in a “strong bullish trend” despite breaking below the $106,000 support level. According to the widely followed analyst and trader, Bitcoin is primed to “bounce” as there is strong support at around the $104,000 price level. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on Sherpa’s chart on the four-hour time frame, Bitcoin could fall lower to just above $103,000 and then trade sideways for a while in a consolidation zone. “Things look okay for now, I would expect more pokes around this area but the longer the time spent here, the better in my opinion. You want to see a good low form.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,841 at time of writing. Turning to Popcat ( POPCAT ), Sherpa says the memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem is one of the altcoins that is in “dangerous territory.” Based on Sherpa’s chart of POPCAT on the four-hour time frame, the memecoin is at risk of breaking a crucial support area after printing a bearish lower high setup. “Coins that were great before like POPCAT might have just made a lower high and could be breaking this last low. I’m not saying it won’t bounce but I’m much more cautious right now than two weeks ago.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X POPCAT is trading at $0.385 at time of writing, down by around 30% over the past week.

2025-05-31T09:08:28,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 31 May, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 31 May, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Hello again! If you thought May was going to close out quietly, think again. This past week has been chaotic – full of volatility, influence, and power plays. From sudden exchange bans to surprising legal reversals, the industry is being pushed – and pulled – by regulators across the globe. Thailand’s crackdown, the SEC’s unexpected move to drop charges, and growing political pressure in the U.S. are just a few signs that the industry is moving fast. But let’s take a step back to get you all caught up. Here’s the top stories that you might have missed + everything you need to know to go into June well prepared. Let’s begin. #1 Trump-Era Shift? SEC Walks Away from Binance Battle After nearly two years of headline-grabbing allegations, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The dismissal, filed with prejudice , means the regulator can’t reopen the case. The SEC simply said the decision was made “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter.” The move follows a 60-day pause and growing speculation about a regulatory tone shift under President Trump. Binance was originally accused of inflating volumes, misusing funds, and trading unregistered securities. Now? The case is closed with no admission of guilt. Binance, as expected, celebrated the win as did the larger crypto community. Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed. Thank you to Chairman Atkins & the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement. U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning. — Binance (@binance) May 29, 2025 #2 Reform’s Farage Set to Make UK a Global Crypto Powerhouse Nigel Farage is betting big on Bitcoin AND the British ballot. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, the Reform UK leader unveiled his party’s “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” promising to slash crypto capital gains tax to 10%, create a Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England, and outlaw banks from de-banking crypto users. “We are going to launch in Britain a crypto revolution,” he said, holding up the bill on stage. With crypto adoption soaring among young Brits, Farage says it’s time to catch up and he’s ready to lead that charge. #3 U.S. Lawmakers Launch CLARITY Act for Clear Crypto Rules Regulatory confusion has been a constant headache for the U.S. crypto industry but that may be about to change. On May 29, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, aiming to draw clear lines around digital assets. Led by Rep. French Hill and supported by key figures like Tom Emmer, this bill wants to assign clear agency oversight and legal definitions to the crypto market. With areas like exchange registration and stablecoin rules on the table, it could bring much-needed certainty. If passed, the CLARITY Act might be the framework the U.S. has long lacked, giving both investors and innovators room to breathe. Can’t wait! #4 Trump Media to Join Bitcoin Billionaires’ Club President Donald Trump’s media startup, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is making a headline-grabbing move: it plans to pour $2.5 billion into bitcoin. The company, known for Truth Social and Truth+, announced it will fund the purchase by selling stock and convertible bonds. Devin Nunes, TMTG’s CEO and Trump ally, called bitcoin “an apex instrument of financial freedom” and said holding crypto will protect the company from “harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” This deal could soon put TMTG among the largest public corporate holders of bitcoin, showing how the Trump camp is doubling down on digital assets. #5 Thailand Cuts Off Five Unlicensed Crypto Giants Thailand is drawing the line! Starting June 28, five big-name centralized exchanges – Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT – will be cut off from the country’s internet. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear: these platforms have been operating without proper registration. This is a protective move against crypto-related crimes and money laundering. The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society will enforce the ban, aiming to shield investors and clean up Thailand’s digital scene. #6 GameStop Buys Bitcoin, Loses Wall Street GameStop just made a $500 million bet on Bitcoin but investors are not on board. The move, intended to offset falling video game sales, triggered a 10% stock drop immediately, and a total plunge of 23%. While the company raised $1.5 billion to fund the pivot, critics aren’t sold. Many fear it’s like past mistakes, exposing GameStop to Bitcoin’s volatility. With store closures increasing and revenue declining, this shift has left the market asking: is this an act of desperation? #7 Solana to Hit $275? Standard Chartered Thinks So Standard Chartered dropped a bold forecast: Solana could hit $275 by end-2025 and stretch to $500 by 2029. The bank sees strength in Solana’s low-fee, high-volume use cases especially for financial and consumer apps. But there’s a catch: “achieving scale… could take time.” Despite leading meme coin activity, the bank notes $SOL looks cheap compared to its application revenue. Still, it expects Solana to underperform Ethereum near-term, with the $ETH/$SOL ratio rising to 17 by 2027, before correcting. Big potential, but the road’s not smooth. #8 Elon Musk Exits Trump Administration Elon Musk is out. The billionaire has officially stepped down from his role in the Trump administration, citing mounting frustration with the federal government’s resistance to cost-cutting reforms. As head of the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Service, Musk had aimed to rein in bloated spending but Trump’s sweeping budget plan pushed the deficit in the opposite direction. “Much worse than I realized,” he admitted, referring to the bureaucratic pushback. #9 New Stablecoin Bill May Lock In Dollar’s Digital Future The GENIUS Act recently cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, and it could redefine how the U.S. treats stablecoins and the dollar’s role in Web3. Backed by a 66–32 procedural vote, the bill demands 1:1 dollar reserves, strict audits, and federal licensing. Foresight Ventures says this would make the USD the “world’s digital settlement currency.” However, let’s hold further speculation till the final floor vote. #10 Cantor Fitzgerald Launches Bitcoin Fund Crypto cautious? This might be for you. Cantor Fitzgerald is launching a five-year Bitcoin fund – but here’s the twist: it’s hedged 1:1 with gold. Capture Bitcoin’s upside while using gold to lock in downside protection. “It’s designed to bring traditional investors into the ecosystem,” said Chairman Brandon Lutnick at Bitcoin 2025. Cantor’s previously teamed up with Maple and FalconX on BTC lending. Now, they’re taking a bigger swing at merging legacy finance with digital assets. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! SharpLink Doubles Down on ETH: In an interesting play, SharpLink Gaming shifted $425M into ETH and named Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman, marking one of the largest crypto treasury plays by a public company to date. NY Crypto Investor Held Hostage: Michael Carturan, an Italian crypto investor, was abducted in New York and held hostage for 17 days – all so his captors could get to his Bitcoin. The suspects have been caught, but the case is a reminder that holding crypto wealth isn’t just a digital risk anymore. Hong Kong Sets the Stage for Stablecoin Licensing: Hong Kong passed a law creating a formal license for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. This puts it among the first to offer clear rules, aiming to attract global crypto firms and boost its Web3 ambitions. SEC’s High-Profile June Summit: On June 5, the SEC will hold a conference highlighting how tokenization is transforming asset management and explore regulatory frameworks to support innovation in digital assets. TON’s New VP Hire Sparks Rally: TONcoin surged nearly 16% after Nikola Plecas, ex-Visa payments exec, joined TON Foundation as VP of Payments. His move ignited a sharp buying spree, pushing $TON past $3.25 with strong volume support. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead: With regulatory fog finally starting to clear, June looks set to bring some major moves. The GENIUS Act could reach final approval, potentially locking in the U.S. dollar’s digital future. Expect more institutional players to jump in as clearer rules and new products, like Cantor Fitzgerald’s gold-hedged Bitcoin fund, gain traction. Hong Kong is positioning itself as a stablecoin hub, attracting global crypto firms with fresh licensing laws and a clear regulatory framework. May’s mix of regulatory progress, growing adoption, and security challenges shows the market is volatile but also maturing fast. The crypto story keeps unfolding – we’ll bring you the headlines that matter.

2025-05-31T09:05:30,"Bitcoin Shrinking Supply Sets Stage for Potential Price Surge","Bitcoin is entering a new phase of supply constraints that could significantly impact its price in the months ahead, according to Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at the digital asset banking group Sygnum. In a recent interview , Tischhauser pointed to what she calls a “supply shock” — a state in which Bitcoin’s liquid supply is dwindling while institutional demand continues to grow. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect,” Tischhauser said, estimating that for every $1 of net new demand, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could increase by $20 to $30. “We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the BTC spot ETFs or around the US elections,” she added. BTC’s supply, particularly the portion actively traded, has been declining over the past 18 months. Tischhauser attributes this trend to the rise of long-term holding structures such as institutional acquisition vehicles, including Strategy and Twenty One Capital. These entities are accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of holding it off exchanges, which reduces the amount available to meet new demand. A Perfect Storm of Bullish Drivers Tischhauser also pointed to macroeconomic and regulatory developments contributing to her bullish outlook. With rising concerns over inflation and increasing global interest in BTC as a deflationary store of value, the narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” is gaining traction. Additionally, regulatory clarity in the United States and other major economies is encouraging institutional participation, which could further reduce supply available for retail investors. Since April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have only seen four days of outflows , indicating steady institutional interest and capital inflow. This consistent demand, combined with structural supply constraints, sets up what some analysts believe could be a dramatic rally in the coming quarters. Healthy Pause in Bitcoin Price Nick Forster, founder of on-chain options protocol Derive, agrees that Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major move , but not before taking a breather. “The current price action suggests a phase of consolidation,” Forster said, calling it a “healthy pause” that allows the market to stabilize after reaching new highs. This period of sideways movement may also serve as a base for a strong upward push, with some analysts projecting BTC’s next peak between $200,000 and $300,000. As the supply continues to tighten and demand holds strong, the groundwork may already be in place for next bull run.

Bitcoin fell over 2% to under $104,000 and traded just over $103,600 in Asian afternoon hours Saturday, while the CoinDesk 20 index slumped 4.2% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 4%, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain (BNB), Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL showed losses between 2-5%. Cronos Network’s CRO was the only gainer in the top 100 tokens with a 12% on no immediate catalyst. Analysts attributed the downturn to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. “President Trump accused China on social media of violating the recent trade truce, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted in an interview that talks with Beijing had stalled.” The derivatives market also pointed to increasing investor caution. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is up 51% since April, while options have ballooned by 126%, according to data from Deribit. Whale wallets, which had been accumulating Bitcoin throughout the year, recently shifted to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges — a classic sign of profit-taking.

2025-05-31T08:00:40,"FTX Recovery Trust Begins $5 Billion Second Round of Creditor Payments","The FTX Recovery Trust has begun the second round of creditor repayments, releasing approximately $5 billion to eligible claimants as part of its ongoing effort to reimburse users affected by the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. This latest distribution , which started on May 30, targets claimants in both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have successfully completed all pre-distribution requirements. According to a May 28 announcement, the payout covers various categories of claims. Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims will receive a 72% reimbursement, while U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive 54%. Those holding Convenience Claims are being paid 120% of their entitled value, reflecting their priority in the distribution process. Meanwhile, General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are slated to receive a 61% distribution. Recipients should expect to see the funds in their accounts within one to two business days via the official partners, Kraken and BitGo . Crypto Markets Watch Closely for Liquidity Impact Market analysts and crypto traders are watching the reimbursements closely due to their potential impact on digital asset prices. The release of billions of dollars back into the hands of retail and institutional investors could introduce short-term volatility, particularly if large sums are sold or exchanged for other assets on public platforms. This round of repayments follows the initial February 18 distribution, in which $1.2 billion was sent to creditors with claims under $50,000 . At the time, Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan noted that a significant share of those funds might find their way back into crypto markets, either as reinvestment or liquidity provision. Critics Continue to Question Fairness of FTX Payout Structure Despite the substantial funds being returned, the reimbursement process has not been without controversy. A key concern lies in the court ruling that determined payouts would be based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy petition, rather than their current market prices. FTX creditor and vocal critic Sunil Kavuri highlighted that many creditors only received 10% to 25% of the current value of their crypto holdings due to the low market prices during the petition date. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $16,000—a fraction of its current value. Kavuri also raised alarm earlier this year over the exclusion of users in 163 countries , including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and Greenland, who are ineligible to receive reimbursement under the current plan. As the FTX Recovery Trust continues its efforts , the broader crypto community remains divided on whether justice has truly been served.

2025-05-31T08:00:22,"Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","The post Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of Hedera crypto is $ 0.16354466 . Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Projection 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.16354466 -6.39% Market Cap. $ 6,908,087,254.9777 Trading Volume. $ 222,167,822.5383 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 The external factors, like Trump’s tariff threat , have pushed the HBAR price into a consistent decline and have recently taken a strong rejection from the 200-day EMA band . Since mid-May, the HBAR crypto has shattered nearly 30%, coming from $0.233 to $0.162. Adding more fuel to the fire, the intraday sell pressure of 10% has broken the previous swing low of $0.170. On the daily chart, it is aiming for a decline towards retesting its critical support of $0.139, which also aligns with Q4 2024 momentum-based high volume profile level. This high volume profile showed strength in Q2 2025’s April month, where a recovery of over 80% from $0.125 to $0.228 was observed. This time, HABR approaching this level is critical, as it has become a “make or break level. If bullish forces step in again as seen last month, then a rally could spark, then there is a higher chance for its price to clear $0.401, and reach $0.750 by the 2025 year-end. But if the support has been weakened from a previous retest, then its break would be fearsome, which could even push HBAR price to the $0.072 level in a fast-paced momentum, as displayed in Q4 when bulls were in command. Unlike its price action, the internal fundamental factors are on the optimistic side. Its efforts have been reflected in significant progress in its ecosystem. In 2025, it introduced the first Hedera-native hardware wallet, Citadel, and AI-powered Hedera Agent Kit, allowing users to create tokens, reducing technical barriers. Another strong project is set to launch in Q3 2025, named HashSphere, a private, permissioned blockchain for highly regulated industries like payment providers and asset managers. To facilitate secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins while ensuring regulatory compliance. Even in order to streamline their work, on May 15, 2025, Hedera rebranded, renaming the HBAR Foundation to the “Hedera Foundation” and the Hedera Governing Council to the “Hedera Council.” Overall, the internal factors suggest that optimism is not so shallow, right now, and we can see some big moves in 2025, if all things are aligned well. But, still, the external factors highlight great caution for market participants.

2025-05-31T07:50:13,"Meta shareholders vote against Bitcoin treasury","Meta Platforms shareholders have voted down a proposal to assess adding Bitcoin to the company’s treasury during an annual meeting this week. According to reports, over 4.9 billion shareholders voted against the move, with about 8.9 million shares absent, and over 205 million non-votes. The move makes Meta Platforms the latest big tech firm to consider a shareholder push to add Bitcoin to its treasury following the previous push by Microsoft some months ago. However, just like this move, it ended in disappointment after shareholders voted to reject the proposal citing concerns about volatility. According to reports, the company said it was prioritizing a push into artificial intelligence over cryptocurrency investments. The Meta Bitcoin treasury proposal was submitted by investor Ethan Peck, who stands as a representative of the National Center for Public Research (NCPPR), asking the company to look into the likelihood of converting some of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin to preserve shareholder value better. At the time, the proposal gained noticeable attention, with Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor publicly drumming support for the initiative. Meta shareholders vote down Bitcoin adoption push According to filings, Meta, as of September 30, 2024, had about $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which the proposal claimed the values were being eroded by inflation and low returns. The move presents Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and strong trading pattern compared to bonds, as a reliable store of value in the long term. Meta Platforms Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal pic.twitter.com/ZeIrUHq2OK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) May 30, 2025 According to the filing, there has also been an increased push in institutional Bitcoin adoption, mentioning Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation, and speculations about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves in 2025. It also mentioned that Meta’s leadership had been showing interest in the asset, though via informal means, highlighting that its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max”. However, the board of directors was against the push, calling it unnecessary. In their response, the Meta board mentioned that the company already had a robust management practice in place, noting that it prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support its operations. The board also added that the company usually evaluates these broad ranges of investable assets and upon their recent evaluation, there was no need for a separate assessment focused on Bitcoin. Gravitation towards stablecoins and AI on the agenda According to a recent statement, the board explained its decision to ignore the buzz of digital assets. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury,” Meta’s board of directors noted in a statement. While the company may not be eyeing Bitcoin in the short term, there won’t be any surprises if it decides to shift focus in the future. This is because there has been a considerable number of firms that have made the shift in the past, including Strategy. In addition, there is also a rising trend of industry players making Bitcoin-focused investments over the last few months due to the now relaxed regulations in the United States. Also, there are reports that Meta may be looking into stablecoins in the time being, with the company also choosing to focus on its ongoing push into artificial intelligence . According to Forbes, Meta has explored integrating stablecoins into its platforms to facilitate global payouts, holding discussions with crypto infrastructure firms to that effect. The move marks a re-entry into the crypto space for the company after its exit from the industry some years back following a regulatory setback with its Diem project. The initial effort was looking into the use of stablecoins for cross-border payments, with the firm hoping to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional system.

2025-05-31T07:45:32,"Crypto Market Surges Past $3.5 Trillion as Institutions, DeFi, and Stablecoins Drive a New Era","The international cryptocurrency market has surged beyond an incredible $3.5 trillion in total capitalization, producing one of the most seismic rallies in digital asset history. At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin. That momentum looks set to continue; but strength is spreading across the broader ecosystem as well pic.twitter.com/j6g3IeDJ7F — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 29, 2025 Aave stands out among singularly-focused protocols, leading the decentralized lending market with an approximate total value locked of $25 billion. The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:40:57,"Bitcoin Dips 5% from Last Week’s High, But Strong On-Chain Support Near $100K Signals Potential Rebound","Recently, Bitcoin has had a notable correction and has come down about 5% from last week’s peak. This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-31T07:37:54,"Saudi Prince Drops $100 Million on XRP. Here’s What This Means for XRP","Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud has invested $100 million into XRP through a strategic partnership with publicly traded company VivoPower International PLC (NASDAQ: VVPR). In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.

2025-05-31T07:37:42,"Ethereum Outshines Bitcoin as Exchange Outflows Spike and Whales Move Funds","This week, the crypto markets have put Ethereum in the spotlight, with the altcoin outperforming even Bitcoin and signaling a distinct change in investor sentiment. Massive amounts of ETH have flowed out of exchanges, suggesting that a move into cold storage has taken place. Cold storage is when traders move their assets off exchanges and into hardware wallets, a storage solution that is much more secure than keeping crypto on an exchange. Ethereum appears to have very secure long-term holders. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Exchange Outflows Suggest Strategic Accumulation This week, Ethereum saw extremely large volumes of coins leaving centralized exchanges, which is an indicator that has usually foreshadowed an increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. When Ethereum and other altcoins are moving off exchanges in large amounts, it’s a net positive for their prices. Although Bitcoin has had a relatively stable price, Ethereum has performed significantly better and continued to do so over the same timeframe. This performance differential, along with net outflows, signals a change in sentiment. Investors seem to be moving into ETH as they anticipate major events that could catalyze the price. This sentiment has been intensified by recent spot inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. On May 29, those funds recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million. The funds, in fact, are riding a streak of nine consecutive days of positive net inflows. With these kinds of consistent inflows, Ethereum ETFs are a way for institutions and retail investors to access Ethereum in a regulated manner. And this kind of demand for something like an Ethereum ETF is a sign of growing accessibility for crypto. On May 29 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $359 million, ending a 10-day streak of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million, marking a 9-day streak of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Dormant ICO Whales Awaken: Massive ETH Movements Raise Eyebrows Together with the wider market, two Ethereum wallets from the time of the ICO have awakened from long dormancy and are now making huge transactions that have caught the eye of blockchain analysts. An early participant in the Ethereum ICO has an address tied to it and at one time held a mind-boggling 1 million ETH. Just five hours ago, this address moved 959.69 ETH to the OKX exchange. At current market valuations, the transferred amount is approximately worth $2.54 million. Despite this massive transaction, the address still retains a whopping 50,704 ETH on-chain, valued at around $132 million. 这次是两个 ICO 巨鲸一起发力了，成本都是低至 0.31 美金的大佬 1⃣ ETH ICO 100 万枚 $ETH 巨鲸 5 小时前向 #OKX 充值 959.69 ETH，价值 254 万美元；链上仍剩余 50704 ETH，价值 1.32 亿美元 https://t.co/JFVlWHNe7N 2⃣ 2015 年 ICO 10 万枚 $ETH 的 OG 3 小时前向 #Kraken 充值 587 ETH，价值… https://t.co/xOj0szBX2C pic.twitter.com/5Rh5zgUmVE — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) May 30, 2025 Not only is this address’s holding large, but it also has a significant historical context. According to blockchain records, this wallet acquired its ETH during the ICO at the astonishingly low price of around $0.31 per coin. Such moves made by early adopters can be interpreted in various ways — they may have been profit-taking or involve a kind of strategic reallocation. This week also saw news emerge about a second wallet, believed to be associated with a participant in the 2015 Ethereum ICO and currently holding around 100,000 ETH. Just three hours ago, this wallet transferred 587 ETH to Kraken, which, at the current market rate, equates to about $1.56 million. Since March 13, 2023, the same address has sold a total of 14,398 ETH, bringing in approximately $28.47 million at an average price of $1,977. This slow and almost laboriously drawn-out sell-off pattern indicates that if this address is indeed a whale, it’s presently exiting either the Ethereum or Web3 space, or diversifying its assets. Market Implications and the Road Ahead These synchronized actions create a many-sided depiction of Ethereum’s contemporary condition. On one side, institutional investors are embracing Ethereum with a swift-paced buying frenzy, as shown by the ETF inflow now stretching across nine consecutive days. On the other side, a handful of very old and very large Ethereum holders — some of which have been clutching their assets since the Ethereum ICO back in 2014 — are starting to sell off portions of their holdings after nearly a decade. Even with these substantial sales, ETH’s price has held strong, thanks to the collective confidence in the crypto market and because of the dwindling supply of liquid Ethereum resulting from the cold wallet migrations. If the current trend of outflows holds, Ethereum may see less of an obligation to sell and more of a platform for price increases. Ethereum 2.0 is in a progressive stage of its upgrades, layer 2 adoption is rising, and ETF inflows are on the upswing, putting Ethereum (ETH) in a robust position. Yet, even with all these positive developments, there is a group of investors who could still negatively impact Ethereum’s price in the near term. Those investors are the ICO whales. Ethereum is proving its relevance yet again as the crypto market heads into the second half of 2025. It’s not just a smart contract platform; it’s a maturing financial asset drawing interest from both long-term believers and institutional capital.

New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. According to the filing, Buffett has allocated most of the firm’s cash reserves to US Treasuries as of Q1 2025, followed by investments in equity securities at $263.735 billion. Berkshire also has a $36.892 billion cash position as of last quarter, which ended in March. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. If Warren Buffett’s investment firm were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest foreign holder of Treasury Securities, just behind France’s $363.1 billion, Ireland’s $329.3 billion and Switzerland’s $311.6 billion holdings. Berkshire’s push for yield on its cash comes after the firm offloaded $3.23 billion worth of shares in three US banking giants last quarter. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

2025-05-31T07:00:05,"Solana Retests Critical Support Amid Market Pullback – $200 Rally In Danger?","As the month nears its end, the crypto market turns momentarily red, with Solana (SOL) retesting a crucial support level that could determine its short-term performance. An analyst suggests that holding the current range over the weekend will be key for the long-awaited rally back to $200. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Solana Hits Multi-Week Low Amid the crypto market pullback, most cryptocurrencies are recording a red Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) momentarily losing some key levels. Solana, one of the cycle’s leading Altcoins, followed the rest of the market and registered a 6% retracement in the daily timeframe. SOL has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. Over the past month and a half, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed multiple crucial levels, setting the stage for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the key $180 resistance despite hitting a three-month high of $187 a week ago. A reclaim of this key barrier could push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. Today’s price action has sent Solana to a 22-day low of $156 after losing its $164-$180 price range and the $160 support zone for the first time since the May 8 breakout. Trader and analyst Crypto Bullet shared a bearish outlook for Solana, suggesting that the token will underperform for the rest of the year. He highlighted SOL’s trading pair against ETH, noting that the cryptocurrency has been in a rising wedge in the weekly chart since the Q4 2024 rally. According to the SOL/ETH chart posted by the trader, the cryptocurrency has broken down out of the formation after losing the 0.069 mark. To Crypto Bullet, this signals that “ETH will soon pump way harder than SOL.” All Eyes On SOL’s Weekly Close Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Solana is attempting to continue Weekly Closing within its Range High resistance, which is key for its long-term rally. He previously explained that the cryptocurrency re-entered its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range after successfully reclaiming the $120 barrier last month and consolidating within the $160-$175 range high. To the analyst, SOL’s price “needs to continue demonstrating price stability” around this zone, as that is what is “required for SOL to break out from this range into the $200+ levels.” He affirmed that Solana needs to aim for a retest similar to late 2024, when the cryptocurrency built a base around the Range High ahead of the breakout with multiple weekly closes near the resistance zone, which led to a massive breakout to the $200 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight? Rekt Capital highlighted that SOL has been successfully retesting this area as support over the past few weeks. However, he warned that cryptocurrency mustn’t close below the current price zone as it would “tease a possible loss of this region as support.” A drop below this range could lead to a retrace into the Range Low, between the $120-$135 mark. “Price stability at the Orange Range High going forward is thus key here,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $159, an 11.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

2025-05-31T06:41:10,"Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?","The post Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets slid on Friday as fresh tariff concerns once again discouraged investors. Bitcoin is down over 2% today, trading at $103,700. Smart contract platforms also took a big hit as Solana fell 6.3%, Sui dropped 7.8%, and Avalanche slid 7.3%. Crypto stocks were also affected as Bitdeer (BTDR) sank 8.3% after a big rally, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) dipped 2.7% and Coinbase (COIN) lost 1.3%. U.S.-China Trade Tensions Startle Crypto Markets The rising U.S.-China tensions are back in focus after a brief truce earlier this month. President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday , which had a major impact on their short-term price action. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1B Today: Time to Exit and Take Profits? , Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-31T06:29:13,"Block: A Quick Recovery, Now At A Crossroads (Maintain Strong Buy)","Summary Block's post-earnings selloff was overdone - recent product launches and its bitcoin business justify the stock's rapid recovery. Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE. Meanwhile, EPS is inflecting underpinned by robust subscription & services segment growth. I believe there's plenty of reason to remain bullish, as described in this article, so I believe there's plenty of reason to remain invested or initiate a position in Block stock. I rate the company a Strong Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791373-block-a-quick-recovery-now-at-a-crossroads-maintain-strong-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC|XYZ",cryptocompare

In the last month, it climbed 32.98%. However, the past week saw a decline of 13.03%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XMR is trading between $363.54 and $447.06. The nearest resistance level is $475, and the nearest support is at $308.04. If the price breaks above $475, it may target the second resistance at $559, an increase of about 18%. If it falls below support, it could drop to the second support at $224.52. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.28, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold conditions, which might signal a potential price rise. With a 10-day Simple Moving Average of $347.51 below the 100-day SMA of $385.54, there is a short-term bearish signal. The MACD level at -3.8161 supports this, while the Stochastic at 57.76 is neutral. These indicators suggest Monero may consolidate before moving significantly. Given its strong performance over recent months, if XMR breaks above resistance, it could continue its upward trend. Conclusion While XMR could triple due to Bitcoin’s rise, XYZVerse offers greater potential with its sports memecoin ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth and community-led success.

2025-05-31T06:07:21,"Crypto Markets Shed $200B in 48 Hours as Bitcoin Dumps to 12-Day Low (Weekend Watch)","Perhaps driven by the latest escalation of tensions between the US and China, bitcoin’s price has tumbled over the past 12 hours to a multi-week low of $103,000. The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11. The total crypto market cap has seen roughly $200 billion gone in the past two days and is down to $3.360 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-05-31T05:30:44,"Bitcoin’s Price Sees Drop as Altcoin Traders Face Increased Pressure","Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory has encountered resistance after reaching a record-breaking peak of over $111,000 last week. Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

This trend has intensified following the ETF’s approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin’s stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market. Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.
