2025-07-17T19:56:11,"WazirX Funds Recovery Back on Track as Singapore High Court Orders New Creditor Vote","The Singapore High Court has set aside its June 4, 2025, order rejecting WazirX‚Äôs restructuring plan and ordered a new creditor vote on an amended scheme, potentially clearing the path for the exchange to reopen and begin distributing funds to users affected by the $230 million hack in July 2024. The court extended Zettai‚Äôs moratorium protection and allowed the revote following further arguments presented by WazirX‚Äôs parent company. If the amended scheme receives approval from the requisite majority of creditors and court sanction, the WazirX platform will reopen with Zanmai facilitating distributions under Indian jurisdiction. Update on Court Hearing The Singapore High Court has set aside its 4th June 2025 order in SUM 940, and has allowed a revote to be conducted based on an amended scheme. Zettai‚Äôs moratorium has also been extended. This decision follows further arguments presented by Zettai.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/j0pfywAufo ‚Äî WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) July 16, 2025 Singapore High Court Has Ruled, Giving Users Hope The decision marks a dramatic reversal after the court previously rejected the moratorium application, citing concerns about transparency regarding Zettai‚Äôs undisclosed relocation to Panama and rebranding as Zensui Corporation. The earlier rejection exposed WazirX to potential litigation in India and left users without access to funds for nearly one year. WazirX founder, Nischal Shetty, announced that Proof of Reserves will launch after the platform restarts, stating that current token balances remain unchanged since no deposits or withdrawals are being processed. We will launch Proof of Reserves (POR) after WazirX restarts. Right now, the token balances remain unchanged since no new deposits or withdrawals are being processed while the platform is offline. A live POR at this stage wouldn‚Äôt add much value, and would divert resources‚Ä¶ https://t.co/1xLSaaFsTu ‚Äî Nischal (Shardeum) (@NischalShetty) July 17, 2025 An independent assessor has already verified current holdings and submitted the report to the court and creditors. Additionally, the exchange initially pledged to return 85% of user balances through recovery tokens representing unrecovered funds, though legal challenges and investor objections have stalled progress. Users have expressed frustration over repeated delays and a lack of transparency throughout the recovery process. Court Reversal Provides Second Chance for Fund Recovery The Singapore High Court‚Äôs decision to allow a revote followed months of legal uncertainty after the initial restructuring plan faced rejection. The court had previously declined to sanction WazirX‚Äôs proposal due to transparency issues surrounding Zettai‚Äôs corporate restructuring and relocation activities. WazirX had secured a four-month conditional moratorium in September 2024, which protected the company from litigation in different regions. The June 4 rejection also opened the door for Indian users to file litigation domestically to seek recovery of their locked funds. The exchange warned users in February that repayments could be delayed until 2030 if the court rejected the restructuring plan, potentially forcing the company into liquidation. A successful restructuring would allow faster, structured repayments with possible profit-sharing benefits. Singapore High Court extends @WazirXIndia ‚Äôs moratorium, allowing the exchange a final opportunity to present restructuring arguments after the $234M crypto hack. #Singapore #WazirX https://t.co/SsLj5zr218 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 More than 93% of voting creditors approved the initial restructuring plan in April 2025 ; however, legal complications and resistance from Zettai delayed its implementation. The amended scheme addresses court concerns while maintaining the core framework for user compensation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a notice on May 30 requiring all unlicensed exchanges operating in Singapore to cease services by June 30. Zettai‚Äôs relocation to Panama and rebranding as Zensui Corporation were intended to address regulatory compliance issues. How WazirX Got Here: The Big Disaster The WazirX hack in July 2024 resulted from hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the exchange‚Äôs multisig wallet system, manipulating the interface to trick authorized signers into approving a malicious smart contract upgrade. The attack bypassed established security measures and drained approximately $230 million in cryptocurrency assets. The hack also exposed ownership conflicts between Zettai and Binance regarding WazirX operations, complicating the restructuring process. Users have demanded greater transparency and implementation of Proof of Reserves to prevent future security incidents. TBH‚Ä¶.Indian crypto users just wants their funds BACK They‚Äôre tired of your lies.

However, the tokens remain speculative pending successful completion of the restructuring process. The exchange has committed to completing the revoting process as quickly as possible, with distributions beginning promptly if the amended scheme receives approval. Users await concrete timelines for the voting process and the potential reopening of the platform, which has been suspended for nearly a year.

2025-07-17T19:30:44,"Digital Ruble Set to Revolutionize Russian Payments by 2026: A Major Shift","BitcoinWorld Digital Ruble Set to Revolutionize Russian Payments by 2026: A Major Shift The financial world is constantly evolving, and a significant tremor has just been felt from Russia. A groundbreaking law has been approved, mandating the rollout of the digital ruble and universal QR payments across the nation, with a firm start date of September 1, 2026. This isn‚Äôt just another payment update; it‚Äôs a foundational shift that could redefine how money moves within the Russian financial system , echoing ripples across the global economic landscape. What is the Digital Ruble and Why is Russia Embracing it Now? For those familiar with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, the term ‚Äòdigital currency‚Äô might conjure images of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the digital ruble is fundamentally different. It‚Äôs a form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), meaning it‚Äôs issued and backed by the Central Bank of Russia, just like physical cash or traditional bank deposits. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is centralized and represents a direct liability of the central bank. So, why is Russia pushing for this now? The motivations are multifaceted, blending economic efficiency with strategic autonomy. For years, nations have explored CBDCs to modernize their payment infrastructure, reduce transaction costs, enhance financial inclusion, and gain greater control over monetary policy. For Russia, these benefits are amplified by its unique geopolitical context. A state-backed digital currency can offer a more resilient and independent payment system, potentially mitigating the impact of external financial pressures and sanctions. It‚Äôs a move towards bolstering financial sovereignty and innovation within the Russian financial system . Unpacking the Universal QR Payments Mandate: A Seamless Future? Alongside the digital ruble, the new law introduces a universal QR payments code. This is a crucial element of the grand design, aiming to simplify and standardize digital transactions across the board. Imagine a single QR code that works everywhere, regardless of your bank or the merchant‚Äôs bank. That‚Äôs the vision. Standardization: The mandate requires all banks and merchants to join the digital ruble platform and utilize this universal QR code. This means an end to fragmented payment systems where different apps or codes are needed for various merchants. Ease of Use: For consumers, making payments will become incredibly straightforward. Simply scan the universal QR code with your smartphone, confirm the amount, and the transaction is complete. No Client Fees: A particularly attractive feature is that banks cannot charge clients for using this QR code. This incentivizes adoption and reduces the cost of digital transactions for everyday users, making the digital ruble an appealing option for domestic transfers. Facilitating Digital Ruble Transfers: The QR code is designed to be the primary interface for initiating and receiving digital ruble transactions, ensuring widespread usability for the new currency. This universal approach to QR payments is a clear signal that Russia intends to create a highly integrated and efficient digital payment ecosystem, making the transition to the digital ruble as smooth as possible for its citizens and businesses. The Ambitious Rollout: A Phased Approach to Russia CBDC Implementing a nationwide digital currency system is no small feat. Recognizing the complexity, Russia has outlined a phased rollout strategy to ensure a stable and successful transition for its Russia CBDC initiative. According to Interfax, the timeline is clear: Phase Timeline Participants Key Action Phase 1 Starting September 1, 2026 Major Banks & Merchants Must support digital ruble transactions and universal QR payments. Phase 2 By 2028 Smaller Banks Gradual integration into the digital ruble platform. This staggered approach allows major financial institutions to iron out any technical kinks and gather user feedback before the system is fully expanded. It‚Äôs a pragmatic way to manage the massive undertaking of integrating a new form of money into the existing Russian financial system . The initial focus on major banks ensures that a significant portion of the population and commercial activity is covered from the outset, paving the way for broader adoption. How Will This Impact the Central Bank Digital Currency Landscape? Russia‚Äôs move into the realm of Central Bank Digital Currency is part of a broader global trend, yet it carries unique implications. While countries like China have already launched their digital yuan, and the European Central Bank is actively exploring a digital euro, Russia‚Äôs geopolitical position adds a distinct layer to its CBDC strategy. Globally, CBDCs are seen as a way for central banks to retain relevance in an increasingly digital world, offer a sovereign alternative to private digital currencies, and enhance the efficiency of payment systems. Russia‚Äôs digital ruble could serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other nations considering similar paths, particularly those seeking greater financial autonomy. The development of a robust Russia CBDC system could also influence discussions around cross-border CBDC payments, though initial focus will undoubtedly be on domestic use. As more countries explore or implement their own digital currencies, the potential for new international payment corridors and agreements becomes a fascinating area to watch. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Challenges for the Russian Financial System The introduction of the digital ruble and universal QR payments holds significant promise for the Russian financial system , but like any major technological and regulatory overhaul, it comes with its own set of challenges. Key Benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Instantaneous settlements, 24/7 availability, and reduced intermediaries can make payments faster and more streamlined. Reduced Costs: Eliminating certain fees and the need for physical cash handling can lower operational costs for banks and businesses, potentially benefiting consumers through lower transaction fees. Financial Inclusion: A digital currency can reach unbanked or underbanked populations more easily, provided they have access to a smartphone and basic digital literacy. Monetary Policy Control: The central bank gains greater visibility and potentially more granular control over money supply and circulation, allowing for more targeted economic interventions. Resilience and Sovereignty: A domestically controlled digital payment system offers a degree of insulation from external pressures and strengthens national financial independence. Potential Challenges: Privacy Concerns: As a centralized digital currency, transactions on the digital ruble platform could be traceable by the central bank, raising questions about individual privacy. Public Adoption: Overcoming inertia and building public trust in a new form of money will be critical. Education and seamless user experience will be key. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring the robustness, scalability, and security of the underlying technology to handle nationwide transactions without glitches is a monumental task. Cybersecurity Risks: A centralized digital system presents a single point of failure that could be targeted by cyberattacks, necessitating top-tier security measures. Impact on Commercial Banks: There‚Äôs a potential for disintermediation, as some functions traditionally performed by commercial banks might shift to the central bank, requiring banks to adapt their business models. The success of this initiative will hinge on how effectively Russia navigates these challenges while maximizing the inherent benefits for its economy and citizens. It‚Äôs a delicate balance between innovation, control, and user acceptance. What Does This Mean for the Crypto World and Beyond? For enthusiasts of decentralized cryptocurrencies, the rise of CBDCs like the digital ruble often sparks debate. While both are digital, their fundamental philosophies diverge. Cryptocurrencies champion decentralization, anonymity (to varying degrees), and freedom from central authority. CBDCs, conversely, represent the ultimate form of centralized digital money, reinforcing the power of the state‚Äôs financial institutions. This move by Russia underscores a global trend: governments are increasingly embracing digital money, but on their own terms. It‚Äôs less about adopting blockchain‚Äôs decentralized ethos and more about digitizing fiat currency for efficiency and control. This could lead to a future where CBDCs coexist with, or even compete with, private digital payment systems and traditional banking. It highlights the growing digital transformation of money, pushing both traditional finance and the crypto space to adapt. The approval of the digital ruble and universal QR payments marks a pivotal moment for Russia. By 2026, the nation is poised to operate a modern, efficient, and centrally controlled digital payment system. This ambitious undertaking aims to strengthen the Russian financial system , enhance its resilience, and offer its citizens a seamless way to transact. While challenges remain, the commitment to this digital transformation is clear, positioning Russia as a significant player in the evolving global landscape of Central Bank Digital Currency .

2025-07-17T19:15:02,"Sberbank wants to provide custody services for domestic crypto assets","Russian bank Sberbank plans to offer custody services for the country‚Äôs crypto assets. With more foreign banks embracing crypto custody, Anatoly Pronin, the Executive Director of Sberbank‚Äôs Alternative Payment Solutions Department, said they presented a proposal to the central bank on domestic crypto asset regulation. Lately, Russia‚Äôs central bank has been more open to pro-crypto policies. Last year, they permitted companies to trade in crypto to bypass Western sanctions implemented due to the Ukraine war. Russia‚Äôs Sberbank says it wants to regulate digital assets like the funds in bank accounts At a crypto regulation discussion, Pronin explained that Sberbank would want to oversee crypto assets like it does customer deposits, to ensure token security . He added that their custody service would include mechanisms to freeze assets upon suspicion of illegal activity and promote secure, accessible user transactions. Russia‚Äôs central bank disclosed it would allow financial institutions to provide crypto investment products in late May. It detailed that the new rules would cover instruments, including derivatives and tokenized instruments, tied to crypto value changes. However, investors can only engage in non-deliverable contracts, meaning they can‚Äôt hold or receive cryptocurrencies. The bank also stated that financial institutions must follow a risk-averse assessment strategy before launching crypto instruments to avoid compromising financial stability. However, the CBR never specified whether it would allow crypto custody services. Sberbank came up with a workaround to bypass Western sanctions Sberbank has been trying to make transactions easier for its users. In June, the bank devised a workaround that routes wire transfers to European banks via intermediaries, avoiding Western sanctions and the SWIFT bans. The bank‚Äôs clients can now transfer rubles through its mobile app to European cardholders at Revolut or N26. However, on the recipient‚Äôs side, the transfers do not display Sberbank‚Äôs name; instead, they show the name of a individual, a regional city, or a payment processing entity. So far, about 500,000 rubles, roughly $6400, can be transferred per transaction to European banks, with a monthly threshold of 3 million rubles, worth about $38,200. However, both N26 and Revolut distanced themselves from the alleged transfer scheme, insisting they prohibit any transactions that contravene sanctions. N26 said it routinely conducts compliance assessments, and Revolut warned users that such activity could lead to account restrictions. Regardless, one of the bank‚Äôs staff remarked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dangerous. The bank has always had transfers like that.‚Äù Sberbank moves to expand crypto access for elite Russian investors Just recently, Sberbank said it would become a market maker providing liquidity for regulated platforms that will give qualified Russian investors access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a high-ranking executive unveiled. In an interview with business news outlet RBC, the head of Sberbank‚Äôs Global Markets Department, Alexander Zozulya, praised the Bank of Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúimportant step‚Äù to announce the development of an experimental legal regime (ELR) for crypto transactions and emphasized: ‚ÄúWe expect the emergence of a legal ‚Äòsandbox,‚Äô an analogue of a regulated crypto platform, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to operate directly with cryptocurrencies.‚Äù Zozulya‚Äôs remarks followed recent comments by Central Bank of Russia (CBR) Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who acknowledged earlier this month that direct investment in crypto assets would necessitate regulatory reforms and the development of dedicated infrastructure. During her appearance at the ‚ÄúRussian Stock Market‚Äî2025‚Äù conference in mid-May, Nabiullina also clarified that such transactions should be carried out exclusively within the ELR framework and available only to ‚Äúhighly qualified‚Äù investors. In March, the Central Bank introduced the special regime and the ‚Äú highly qualified investors ‚Äù category. Under the ELR, Russian companies will be permitted to use and exchange cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, providing a way to sidestep restrictions linked to the war in Ukraine.
