2025-07-17T20:59:11,"Trump To Sign Historic Crypto Legislation As House Greenlights 3 Key Bills","On July 17, 2025, a historic day for the entire crypto industry, the House of Representatives passed all three major crypto bills, marking a crucial victory for digital asset proponents. The country’s stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, in particular, is now set to be presented to President Donald Trump, marking the potential for the first substantial piece of cryptocurrency legislation to be signed into law. Historic Vote For Crypto Bills As reported by Fox journalist Eleanor Terret on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), both Democrats and Republicans rallied together, voting in a manner that exceeded expectations. The path forward in the Senate, however, remains fraught with challenges. TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg noted that while the passage of these bills is symbolically significant, the real test will come with the Senate’s ability to build the necessary bipartisan consensus to avoid a filibuster. Seiberg expressed skepticism about receiving comprehensive details on the Senate’s plans until late this year or early next year, emphasizing that the language of any Senate-approved bill will ultimately determine its fate. GENIUS Act Secures Strong Approval The House votes were telling of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in American politics. The CLARITY Act received overwhelming support, passing with a vote of 294 to 134, which included 78 Democrats—more than double the anticipated number. This was a stark contrast to the previous year when only 71 voted for the FIT21 legislation. The GENIUS Act followed suit, passing with a vote of 308 to 122, supported by 102 Democrats. The Anti-CBDC Act, while more narrowly passed at 219 to 210, still saw bipartisan backing with two Democrats joining Republicans in favor.

2025-07-17T20:50:15,"Bitcoin Investors Fuel Remarkable 140K BTC Accumulation Surge in July","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investors Fuel Remarkable 140K BTC Accumulation Surge in July The cryptocurrency world is perpetually buzzing with activity, and Bitcoin, as its pioneer, often takes center stage. Recently, a fascinating trend has emerged, highlighting the underlying strength of the market: a significant influx of capital from new Bitcoin investors . This isn’t just about price pumps; it’s about a quiet yet powerful accumulation that speaks volumes about confidence in the digital gold. Who are these New Bitcoin Investors Driving the Market? In a compelling revelation, data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, as cited by Cointelegraph, indicates a substantial increase in holdings by new Bitcoin (BTC) buyers. During the month of July, these fresh participants added a remarkable 140,000 BTC to their portfolios. This represents an impressive 2.86% increase in their total holdings over just two weeks. This isn’t merely speculative trading; it suggests a strategic move by entities or individuals entering the market with a long-term perspective. What defines a “new” investor in this context? Glassnode’s methodology often tracks wallets or entities that have recently become active or started accumulating Bitcoin, distinguishing them from long-term holders or those engaged in short-term trading. The fact that such a significant volume of Bitcoin is being absorbed by this segment points to a broadening base of support for the cryptocurrency, moving beyond the usual suspects and seasoned veterans. The Power of BTC Accumulation: What Does 140,000 BTC Mean? The sheer volume of BTC accumulation by new investors – 140,000 Bitcoins – is a critical metric. To put this into perspective, this amount represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, especially when accumulated within such a short timeframe. This aggressive buying pattern suggests strong underlying demand that is capable of absorbing selling pressure and providing a solid foundation for price stability and growth. This accumulation trend has several profound implications for the market: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more Bitcoin is moved into longer-term holdings by new participants, the amount available for trading on exchanges decreases, creating a supply squeeze. Increased Market Confidence: It signals a growing belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition, not just among existing enthusiasts but also among fresh capital sources. Foundation for Future Price Appreciation: Persistent accumulation, particularly during market dips, establishes strong support levels, making future price rallies more sustainable. This steady absorption of Bitcoin by new hands indicates a maturing market where participants are increasingly viewing BTC as a legitimate asset class rather than just a speculative gamble. Is a Bitcoin Price Surge Sustainable Without Retail FOMO? Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of this current market dynamic is the disconnect between the significant buying activity and the seemingly subdued retail interest. Despite the clear upward trajectory and consistent capital inflow, mainstream “fear of missing out” (FOMO) appears to be notably absent. Google Trends data, often a reliable indicator of public sentiment and retail engagement, shows low levels of search queries related to Bitcoin and its price surges. This phenomenon presents a unique scenario for a potential Bitcoin price surge : Institutional or High-Net-Worth Driven: The lack of retail FOMO, coupled with strong accumulation, suggests that the fresh capital might be coming from larger entities, institutional investors, or high-net-worth individuals who operate with less emotional bias and more strategic foresight. Healthy Growth Dynamics: Unlike past bull runs fueled primarily by speculative retail frenzy, the current accumulation pattern appears more organic and fundamentally driven. This could lead to a more stable and sustainable price appreciation, less prone to sudden corrections triggered by panic selling. Buying the Dips: The report highlights that this fresh capital continues to support BTC’s price breakout, particularly during dips below key thresholds like $11,800. This behavior underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s value at these levels, reinforcing its role as a robust store of value. The absence of widespread retail euphoria might be a blessing in disguise, allowing Bitcoin to build a stronger, more resilient foundation for its next major move. Diving Deeper with Glassnode Analysis: Unpacking On-Chain Metrics The insights provided by Glassnode analysis are invaluable for understanding the true state of the Bitcoin network. As a leading on-chain analytics platform, Glassnode collects and interprets vast amounts of data directly from the blockchain, offering a transparent view into network activity, investor behavior, and market trends that traditional market indicators often miss. Their findings on new investor accumulation are derived from sophisticated metrics such as: Active Entities: Tracking the number of unique participants interacting with the network. Supply Distribution: Analyzing how Bitcoin is distributed across different wallet sizes and types (e.g., small retail, whales, exchanges). Coin Age Distribution: Understanding how long coins have been held, distinguishing between short-term speculators and long-term holders. Accumulation Trends: Identifying periods where more Bitcoin is moving into illiquid supply, indicating strong holding conviction. This granular level of detail allows analysts to infer market sentiment and future price movements with greater accuracy. The fact that Glassnode points to new investors accumulating suggests a fundamental shift in market dynamics, where a new wave of participants is entering the ecosystem with conviction, rather than just chasing headlines. A Broader Crypto Market Update: What Else is Moving? While Bitcoin often sets the pace, it’s crucial to consider the broader crypto market update . The activity observed in Bitcoin typically has ripple effects across the entire digital asset landscape. The robust accumulation in BTC can signal a period of increasing confidence that extends to altcoins, albeit with varying degrees of correlation. Key observations from the wider market often include: Altcoin Performance: A strong Bitcoin often leads to an “altcoin season” as capital flows from BTC profits into other digital assets, or as investors seek higher returns in smaller cap coins. Institutional Adoption: Beyond individual investors, the increasing interest from institutional players, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries continues to shape the market narrative, bringing more legitimacy and liquidity. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing discussions and evolving regulatory frameworks globally play a significant role in investor sentiment and market structure. Positive clarity can unlock further institutional investment. Technological Advancements: Continuous innovation in blockchain technology, such as Layer 2 solutions, DeFi protocols, and NFTs, contributes to the overall growth and utility of the crypto ecosystem, attracting new users and developers. The current market environment, characterized by strong Bitcoin accumulation by new investors, suggests a foundational strengthening that could pave the way for a more comprehensive market expansion. Conclusion: A Resilient Future for Bitcoin? The data from Glassnode paints a compelling picture: new Bitcoin investors are not just dabbling; they are actively accumulating significant amounts of BTC, adding 140,000 BTC in July alone. This influx of fresh capital, supporting prices even during dips and occurring without the typical retail FOMO, points to a maturing market driven by strategic conviction rather than speculative frenzy. This underlying strength, revealed through meticulous on-chain Glassnode analysis, suggests a resilient and potentially robust future for Bitcoin. The sustained BTC accumulation by these new participants forms a crucial bedrock for future price stability and growth, signaling a deeper belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. As the crypto market continues its evolution, the actions of these new, confident investors will undoubtedly be a key factor in shaping its trajectory.

2025-07-17T20:43:57,"U.S. House officially approves CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC Acts","The House passed three major crypto bills on Thursday, locking in a rare legislative win for the industry. In what’s now the biggest regulatory overhaul for crypto so far, lawmakers voted on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. The votes came after months of lobbying and internal fights between Democrats over how to approach crypto regulation heading into 2025. The GENIUS Act , which had already cleared the Senate, got a final vote of 308-122 in the House. That bill sets rules for stablecoins and is now headed straight to President Donald Trump’s desk. More than 100 Democrats backed the bill, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, joining most Republicans in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement. The goal is to treat crypto more like real money, giving companies the regulatory clarity they’ve been demanding for years. House sends GENIUS and CLARITY bills to Trump Right after that, the House passed the CLARITY Act with a 294-134 vote. This bill is much broader, outlining how crypto firms should register, disclose information, and follow financial rules across different agencies. Seventy-eight Democrats crossed over to back the legislation alongside Republicans. Nancy Pelosi and Pete Aguilar both voted in favor, but Jeffries didn’t. He rejected the CLARITY Act, even though he had supported GENIUS minutes earlier. There was pushback. Maxine Waters, top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned the bills could trigger financial instability and give President Trump a chance to exploit gaps in the system. She said the crypto-friendly rules could “enable corruption,” and questioned whether any of it was designed to protect the economy at all. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act was also passed . That bill blocks the Federal Reserve from creating or piloting any kind of central bank digital currency (CBDC) unless Congress gives the green light. Most Republicans supported it overwhelmingly, saying they don’t want programmable money that lets the government track or control individual transactions. Emmer restricts Fed’s CBDC powers, while Trump’s health raises risk for reversal Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who introduced the bill, added strict rules to make sure no loopholes exist. The legislation says the Federal Reserve can’t “offer products or services directly to an individual,” can’t “maintain an account on behalf of an individual,” and can’t use any renamed version of a CBDC. It also blocks the Fed from using any central bank digital currency to carry out monetary policy. In short, no CBDC, no pilot programs, no technical workarounds. Crypto czar David Sacks praised the House’s votes on X, saying, “Massive wins for crypto in the House: GENIUS Act passes 307-122. CLARITY Act passes 294-134.” The post quickly went viral in crypto circles as the numbers confirmed a landslide. Billy Hagerty, the Senator who originally introduced the GENIUS Act, said the law would update America’s payment systems and boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, adding that it would help make the country the “crypto capital of the world.” Paul Atkins, the pro-crypto SEC chair, said he supports the GENIUS Act because it provides “clear rules of the road” for the industry. He said the law would cut transaction costs, increase speed, and reduce risk, while keeping essential protections in place. Atkins also said this marks a turning point for the U.S. to become a global leader in blockchain tech, not just traditional finance. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed that President Trump is dealing with a chronic vein condition after people noticed bruises on his hand. Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, said Trump had experienced leg swelling and underwent a “comprehensive exam” including a vascular study. If his condition worsens, any or all of the crypto bills could be reversed, just like Trump did to many of Joe Biden’s past policies when he took office. Not everyone is convinced these new laws are safe. Elizabeth Warren, who has been against the crypto industry for nearly a decade, repeated that the bills could wreck the economy if they’re not backed by tough oversight. She added that she doesn’t want to see laws written by “crypto industry lobbyists” getting passed, and she called the current versions “very weak regulation.” “They also don’t put enough safeguards in place for consumer protection,” Elizabeth said. “And guardrails to make sure that crypto isn’t used to blow up our entire economy. So I’m very worried about that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-17T20:40:18,"Bitcoin Treasury: DV8’s Bold Move to Transform Southeast Asia’s Crypto Landscape","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: DV8’s Bold Move to Transform Southeast Asia’s Crypto Landscape In a groundbreaking announcement that sent ripples across the Asian financial landscape, Thai-listed company DV8 revealed its audacious plan to become Southeast Asia’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm. This strategic pivot, fueled by a successful 241 million baht (approximately $7.4 million) capital raise, marks a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of digital assets within the region. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this move signals a new era where traditional companies are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury , and Why Now? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding a significant portion of its corporate reserves in Bitcoin, rather than solely in traditional fiat currencies or conventional assets. This concept gained considerable traction following MicroStrategy’s pioneering adoption, which saw the business intelligence firm accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. The rationale behind such a move is multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing quantitative easing and inflationary concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins positions it as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, offering a decentralized and censorship-resistant store of value. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Proponents believe Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and growing network effect will lead to significant long-term capital appreciation, enhancing corporate balance sheets. Market Leadership: Being an early mover in this space can signal innovation and attract a new class of forward-thinking investors. DV8’s decision underscores a growing global trend where corporations are exploring alternatives to traditional cash management strategies, seeking to optimize their balance sheets in a rapidly evolving economic climate. DV8 ‘s Ambitious Vision: Emulating the Giants The news, initially reported by Odaily, highlights DV8’s clear intention to follow in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy. The Thai firm’s 241 million baht raise provides the foundational capital for this transformation. But what exactly does this mean for DV8? By transforming into a ‘cryptocurrency reserve company,’ DV8 aims to: Acquire and Hold Bitcoin: The primary objective will be to purchase and securely hold Bitcoin as a significant portion of its treasury assets. Boost Shareholder Value: This is the ultimate goal. By leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation, DV8 hopes to significantly enhance its financial position and, consequently, the value for its shareholders. Set a Precedent: As the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, DV8 is positioning itself as a pioneer, potentially inspiring other regional companies to explore similar strategies. This bold move by DV8 is not just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about fundamentally re-evaluating traditional corporate finance in the digital age. Pioneering the Path for Southeast Asia Crypto Adoption DV8’s pivot carries immense significance for the broader Southeast Asia crypto landscape. The region, known for its dynamic economies and tech-savvy population, has shown increasing interest in digital assets, but corporate adoption at this scale has been relatively limited. DV8’s initiative could serve as a powerful catalyst: Increased Legitimacy: A publicly listed company embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset lends significant credibility to the cryptocurrency space within the region. Regulatory Dialogue: Such high-profile moves often spur clearer regulatory frameworks, which are crucial for sustainable growth and broader institutional participation. Regional Inspiration: Other companies in Thailand and neighboring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam might observe DV8’s performance closely, potentially leading to a domino effect of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Investment Hub: This could further cement Southeast Asia’s reputation as a growing hub for blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency investment. The move by DV8 could be the spark that ignites a new wave of corporate interest in digital assets across one of the world’s most vibrant economic regions. The MicroStrategy Model : A Blueprint for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings When DV8 explicitly states its inspiration from MicroStrategy, it’s worth examining what this MicroStrategy model entails. Led by its outspoken CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, citing concerns over inflation and the long-term depreciation of fiat currencies. Their strategy has been characterized by: Aggressive Accumulation: MicroStrategy has consistently added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, often through debt financing or equity raises. Long-Term HODL: The company views Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset, not a short-term trading vehicle. Public Advocacy: Saylor has become a prominent advocate for corporate Bitcoin adoption, educating other companies and investors on its benefits. While the MicroStrategy model has been highly successful in terms of Bitcoin accumulation and attracting market attention, it also comes with inherent risks, primarily related to Bitcoin’s price volatility. DV8 will undoubtedly face similar considerations, navigating market fluctuations while maintaining its long-term vision. Key Differences and Similarities: DV8 vs. MicroStrategy While inspired, DV8’s approach might not be an exact replica. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature MicroStrategy (MSTR) DV8 (Thailand) Primary Business Business Intelligence Software Initially Media & Entertainment; Transforming to Crypto Reserve Treasury Size Billions of USD in Bitcoin Starting with $7.4M raise Geographic Focus Global (US-based) Southeast Asia (Thailand-based) Goal Maximize long-term shareholder value through Bitcoin acquisition Boost shareholder value by transforming into a crypto reserve company DV8’s initial capital raise of $7.4 million is a modest start compared to MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar holdings, but it represents a significant commitment for a company of its size and region. How This Move Aims to Boost Shareholder Value The core motivation for DV8’s strategic shift is clear: to enhance shareholder value . This isn’t merely a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated move based on several economic principles and market dynamics: Capital Appreciation Potential: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown remarkable long-term growth. If this trend continues, DV8’s Bitcoin holdings could significantly inflate its balance sheet. Attracting New Investment: The move positions DV8 as an innovative, forward-thinking company. This can attract a new class of investors who are keen on crypto exposure but prefer to gain it through publicly traded, regulated entities rather than direct crypto purchases. Inflationary Hedging: As discussed, holding Bitcoin can protect the company’s capital from the eroding effects of inflation, preserving and potentially growing its purchasing power over time. Scarcity Premium: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it a scarce asset, a characteristic that often commands a premium in financial markets. By transforming its treasury, DV8 is essentially offering its shareholders indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential, without them having to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership, custody, or regulatory nuances. Challenges and Considerations for DV8 While the potential benefits are significant, DV8’s pioneering move is not without its challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is famously volatile. Significant price drops could lead to impairment charges on DV8’s balance sheet, potentially impacting reported earnings and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Southeast Asia, while evolving, is still fragmented. Future regulations could impact the company’s ability to hold or manage its crypto assets. Custody and Security: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated custody solutions and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Implications: Accounting for Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets can be complex, often requiring companies to record impairment losses when the price drops below their cost basis. Market Perception: While many will laud the move, some traditional investors might view it as too risky or speculative, potentially affecting the company’s traditional investor base. DV8 will need to navigate these complexities with careful risk management and transparent communication to its shareholders. Actionable Insights for Other Companies and Investors DV8’s decision offers valuable lessons and considerations for other corporate treasuries and individual investors: For Corporations: Evaluate your risk appetite and long-term financial goals. Consider a phased approach to Bitcoin adoption, starting with a smaller allocation. Research secure custody solutions and understand the accounting implications. For Investors: This move validates the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. It offers a new avenue for exposure to Bitcoin’s price action through traditional stock markets, particularly for those in Southeast Asia. Always conduct your own due diligence on the company’s overall financial health and strategy. The Future of Treasury: This trend suggests that corporate treasuries are no longer static entities focused solely on cash preservation. They are becoming dynamic vehicles for strategic asset allocation, embracing new technologies and asset classes. A Glimpse into the Future DV8’s transformation into Southeast Asia’s first Bitcoin treasury firm is more than just a corporate strategy; it’s a testament to the evolving financial landscape. It signifies a growing recognition among publicly listed companies that digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, can play a legitimate and valuable role in modern corporate finance. As the first mover in a dynamic region, DV8’s journey will be closely watched, potentially paving the way for a new wave of corporate crypto adoption across Asia and beyond. This bold step could very well redefine how companies perceive and manage their most vital assets in the digital age.

2025-07-17T20:36:04,"Asia-Pacific Faces Record Bitcoin Thefts and Deadly “Wrench Attacks”—Chainalysis","Violent attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders are on track to hit record highs in 2025, with Asia-Pacific among the hardest-hit regions, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. These incidents, commonly known as “wrench attacks,” involve criminals using physical violence or threats to coerce victims into surrendering their digital assets. 2025 On Track to Double Record Year for Crypto-Linked Kidnappings and Thefts As of July, 35 wrench attacks have already been recorded globally, surpassing nearly all previous years and placing 2025 on course to double the record set during the 2021 bull run. Source: Jameson Lopp GitHub Chainalysis says the spike is closely tied to Bitcoin’s rising price, which hit an all-time high of over $122,000 in early July . “These are not just digital crimes anymore,” a Chainalysis spokesperson said. “We’re seeing more kidnappings, extortion cases, and home invasions tied to crypto ownership—particularly in regions with fast-growing retail adoption.” The shift from online exploits to real-world violence comes amid a broader wave of crypto-related theft. Chainalysis estimates that over $2.17 billion has been stolen from cryptocurrency services so far in 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024 . Now, attacks on personal wallets account for nearly a quarter of all stolen funds this year. Chainalysis reports that these crimes are increasingly targeting users, often with devastating consequences. Bitcoin holders, in particular, are experiencing higher average losses, as criminals appear to prioritize large-value wallets. Chainalysis data also shows that the Asia-Pacific region ranks second globally in total Bitcoin stolen and third in Ether theft. Within APAC, countries like Japan, Indonesia, and South Korea have reported a rise in thefts, while nations such as the Philippines are grappling with more extreme outcomes. Source: Chainalysis Chainalysis warns that while wrench attacks are still relatively rare, they have an outsized impact. The physical nature of these crimes, including cases of maiming, kidnapping, and homicide, raises new concerns for crypto users and law enforcement alike. Crypto Wallet Thefts Shift Toward Retail Targets as Losses Mount in 2025 New data reveals a growing trend in crypto-related crimes targeting retail wallet holders, with wallet thefts now causing major financial damage across both developed and emerging markets. While the United States, Germany, and Japan report the highest number of victims, countries like India, Chile, the United Arab Emirates, and Norway are seeing higher average losses per victim. According to Chainalysis, North America currently leads the world in total crypto stolen, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The shift toward targeting users, rather than exchanges or protocols, reflects broader changes in the crypto threat environment. One reason for this shift is improved cybersecurity at centralized exchanges, which has made large platforms more difficult for attackers to penetrate. At the same time, the rising number of high-value self-custodied wallets and the relative ease of identifying crypto holders online have made users increasingly attractive targets. Chainalysis also noted a rise in attacker sophistication, pointing to the use of AI-driven tools to locate, deceive, or coerce victims. “The rise of wrench attacks is a stark reminder that digital assets are only as safe as the people who hold them,” the firm said. Recent findings from blockchain security firm CertiK support the trend. In its midyear report for 2025, CertiK said crypto investors lost more than $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and security breaches in just the first six months of the year. Crypto investors have lost $2.2B to hacks and scams in H1 2025, with $187M recovered as threats shift, reports @CertiK . #CryptoSecurity #Cryptohacks https://t.co/5KCaVsYnbg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 30, 2025 Wallet breaches alone accounted for $1.7 billion across only 34 incidents, making it the most costly threat category so far. Phishing attacks followed, with more than $410 million stolen across 132 cases. While the total number of security incidents was 344, two major attacks, on Bybit and Cetus Protocol, accounted for $1.78 billion of the total losses. Excluding those, the remaining $690 million in damages brings 2025’s figures closer to previous years.

2025-07-17T20:15:24,"BlackRock has finally filed to enable staking for its ETH ETFs","World-leading asset manager BlackRock has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for its spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on July 17. If approved, the firm can stake part or all of the ETH underlying its spot ETH ETF (ETHA) through any staking services providers. With the move, BlackRock has joined the list of spot ETH ETF issuers seeking SEC approval to allow staking. While others, such as Franklin Templeton, Fidelity , 21Shares, and Grayscale, have already applied for the same permit, the move by BlackRock represents the biggest positive sign of potential approval of such products. Efforts to allow staking for ETH ETFs and other altcoin ETFs have intensified since the Donald Trump administration started, and the SEC has changed its approach to many crypto issues, including Ethereum staking. This led to the regulator dropping staking-related lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Before now, the ETF issuers were forced to amend their filings and drop staking from their Ethereum ETF applications in 2024 after the Gary Gensler-led SEC flagged Ethereum staking, noting that it could be unregistered securities. Fight for ETH staking in ETFs that are far from over With BlackRock submitting its 19b-4 filing, many in the crypto industry believe that staking for ETFs is now a done deal. This is not surprising given the firm’s record of only one refusal by the SEC for all its ETF applications and over 500 approvals. However, experts believe that the fight is not over yet. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that there are several staking ETF filings before the SEC, and for earlier filings, the final deadline is late October. The final deadline for BlackRock’s filing is not until April 2026, but the analyst expects a decision from the regulator by Q4 of this year. Seyffart said: “Staking is not ‘done.’ There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25).” Seyffart noted that the major challenge that staking ETF approval will face now is not from the SEC but rather from the Internal Revenue Service. However, he did not go further into how this could be a problem. ETH doubles in value within 3 months thanks to ETFs and Institutional accumulation Meanwhile, the timing of BlackRock’s filing coincides with ETH’s recent performance, which has seen the token wipe out all its losses for the year and finally have a positive year-to-date performance. Over the past three months, ETH price has increased by 114%, a trend that is also evident within shorter periods, with a 38.5% gain in 30 days and 21.12% gains in seven days. The token is now trading at $3,420 and is up 2% year to date. BlackRock filing likely contributed to its gains with the almost 4% rise in ETH value today in what looks like the start of the altcoin season, with ETH, XRP, SOL, and BNB seeing gains while Bitcoin recorded a slight drop. Massive inflows into ETH ETFs in the past few months (Source: James Seyffart) However, the biggest contributor to ETH’s resurgence is likely the institutional interest evident in its ETFs’ inflows and ETH treasury companies’ accumulation. Data shared by Seyffart noted that ETH ETFs now have over $5.5 billion in inflows since launch, with $3.3 billion coming since mid-April. While this is relatively small compared to the $18 billion in net flow for Bitcoin ETFs in the last three months, it highlights the rising interest in spot ETH ETFs.

2025-07-17T20:00:12,"Ex-SEC Attorney Discredits One Major Rumor About XRP in Ripple Case","A rumor suggesting Ripple might pay its court-imposed penalty using XRP has been firmly shut down by former SEC attorney Marc Fagel. The claim, which resurfaced this week within the XRP community, was sparked by speculation that the U.S. government’s recent Bitcoin sales were linked to preparations for accepting XRP as a settlement currency. Fagel, however, directly dismissed this theory as fiction, stating that Ripple has already paid the penalty in cash as ordered by the court. XRP Community Speculation Resurfaces The discussion was reignited when crypto personality Zach Rector posed a provocative question on X: “Why didn’t the government want to hold onto its Bitcoin?” In response, XRP commentator “XRP Savant” suggested it was part of a broader setup for Ripple to settle its SEC penalty in XRP. “Setting the stage for Ripple to pay $150M SEC fine with XRP. Then it goes into reserve,” Savant claimed, adding, “As I predicted 4 months ago. It’s nice to see the experts finally catch up with the Savant.” They already paid in cash. Sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 16, 2025 Savant also cited an April 11 post by analyst John Squire, who wrote: “Ripple vs SEC: The endgame is near. Brad Garlinghouse confirms the lawsuit might be wrapping up. The fine could even be paid in XRP.” Marc Fagel Sets the Record Straight Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco Regional Director, quickly entered the conversation to correct the record. Quoting the original claim, he stated unequivocally: “They already paid in cash. Sorry.” When pressed with Squire’s speculative post, Fagel followed up with a firmer clarification: “I’m stating facts. There’s a court order that they pay cash into escrow. But you can imagine anything you’d like.” Fagel’s comments refer to court documents from the Ripple case, which show that the company was ordered to deposit $125 million, not $150 million, into escrow in U.S. dollars as part of its proposed final judgment with the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Reality vs. Community Hopes While XRP Savant and others continue to push the narrative of XRP being used for institutional settlements or even government reserves, there is no legal basis or regulatory precedent supporting such claims. Courts require penalties to be paid in fiat currency, especially when dealing with assets that are still subject to regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indeed expressed optimism about the lawsuit nearing its conclusion. But there is no public indication, either from Ripple or the SEC, that XRP was ever considered a valid form of payment for the penalty. Cash, Not Crypto Marc Fagel’s comments cut through the noise of crypto speculation with a dose of legal clarity. Ripple’s $125 million fine has been paid in U.S. dollars, not in XRP. While XRP remains central to Ripple’s technology and broader financial ambitions, it is not, as Fagel put it, a substitute for compliance: “There’s a court order that they pay cash. But you can imagine anything you’d like.” In a space often dominated by speculation, facts still matter, and in this case, the facts are crystal clear.

2025-07-17T20:00:06,"Bitcoin Sees Influx Of New Capital: First-Time Buyers Add 140,000 BTC","On-chain data shows the supply held by new Bitcoin buyers has seen a jump recently, a sign that the latest price rally is backed by fresh capital. First-Time Bitcoin Buyers Have Increased Supply By 2.86% In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin ‘First Buyers.’ This cohort is part of Glassnode’s broader investor classification system that is based on behavior. The First Buyers include, as the name already hints, the holders who are buying the cryptocurrency for the first time. The supply associated with the group, therefore, can be considered as a proxy of the fresh capital entering into the sector. Related Reading: XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says Other groups part of the behavioral classification include Momentum Buyers, the investors who ride the tide of price trends, and Conviction Buyers, who step in to buy during price declines. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the First Buyers over the last couple of weeks. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin First Buyers have seen their supply go up during the last two weeks, implying that fresh capital has potentially been entering the market. More specifically, the cohort’s holdings have gone from 4.77 million BTC to 4.91 million BTC in this period, corresponding to an increase of around 140,000 tokens or 2.86%. This is notable and suggests the price surge to the new all-time high (ATH) has attracted real demand. In some other news, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has been relatively muted even after the price rally, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. The Puell Multiple is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily value of coins being ‘issued’ by miners on the blockchain (in USD) and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. In short, the indicator informs us about whether the Bitcoin miners are currently making more revenue from block subsidy compared to the norm or not. Historically, the indicator shooting up to an extreme value has generally aligned with some sort of top for the cryptocurrency. As is visible in the chart, the BTC Puell Multiple is currently sitting around 1.2, which means that miners are making more than the average for the past year, but not by too much. If the past trend is anything to go by, this may be a potential sign that the current cycle still has room for growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Key Level Is $136,000 If Momentum Holds, Glassnode Says Something to note, however, is the fact that the indicator’s peaks have been trending lower with each cycle. Thus, it’s possible that the metric would also top out at a lower level of miner revenue this time around. BTC Price Bitcoin hasn’t been able to sustain recovery since its low as its price is still trading around $117,000.
