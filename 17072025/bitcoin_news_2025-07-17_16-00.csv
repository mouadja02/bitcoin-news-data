2025-07-17T13:55:49,"Crypto Bull: XRP Will Make More Millionaires Than Bitcoin Ever Did","Cryptocurrency proponent Amonyx has publicly expressed confidence in XRP’s potential to generate more millionaires than Bitcoin has in its history. In a recent post on X, Amonyx made a clear assertion that XRP will surpass Bitcoin in creating individual wealth and advised followers to bookmark the statement. His comment comes at a time when XRP has outpaced Bitcoin’s performance over several recent timeframes, according to market data. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s price has increased by approximately 81% while XRP has seen a 444% gain. In the past month, Bitcoin rose by around 11 percent compared to XRP’s 34 percent, and in the past week, Bitcoin appreciated 7 percent while XRP climbed 26 percent. These figures from CoinMarketCap illustrate XRP’s superior percentage gains relative to Bitcoin in the short and medium term, potentially providing a foundation for Amonyx’s perspective. Skepticism About Supply and Market Cap Following Amonyx’s statement , some X users voiced skepticism about the feasibility of his claim. One user, Mike DeVault, argued that XRP’s high supply prevents it from achieving the kind of scarcity-driven value appreciation that Bitcoin enjoys. He stated that for XRP to make all of its holders millionaires, the total market capitalization would need to exceed the value of all global assets, which he considered implausible. DeVault also suggested that widespread millionaire status would erode purchasing power, diminishing the value of wealth. Another user, posting under the handle Stevesik1, countered this argument by comparing XRP to oil markets. He remarked that market capitalization alone does not dictate value, pointing to oil as an example where supply, demand, and utility are the primary drivers of price. He criticized the focus on market capitalization as misguided, arguing that XRP’s utility and demand could sustain its value growth, unlike what he characterized as a speculative asset with no use case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Debate Over Scarcity and Utility In response, DeVault reiterated his view that value in commodities derives from scarcity, citing Bitcoin’s limited supply as the reason for its high price. He argued that XRP’s abundance, unlike Bitcoin’s fixed maximum issuance, works against its ability to create such concentrated wealth. DeVault maintained that control over supply is a key mechanism for preserving value in any commodity, drawing parallels with how oil prices are managed to justify ongoing extraction costs. Current Market Context The exchange reflects a broader conversation in cryptocurrency circles about the roles of utility, scarcity, and market mechanics in determining value. While Bitcoin continues to lead the market by overall capitalization and remains known for its fixed supply, XRP has demonstrated significant price momentum, particularly over the past year. Supporters, such as Amonyx, point to its utility in cross-border payments and strong relative price performance as indicators of its potential to transform wealth generation in the sector. With XRP outperforming Bitcoin in percentage terms across multiple timeframes, advocates argue that it remains undervalued relative to its use case and adoption prospects . Skeptics, however, emphasize the challenges posed by its larger circulating supply and question whether it can sustain a trajectory capable of making as many millionaires as Amonyx predicts. The debate underscores divergent views on what ultimately drives value in digital assets. While no consensus emerged from the discussion, Amonyx’s confidence in XRP’s future remains clear and continues to draw attention as both assets post notable gains in the current market cycle.

2025-07-17T13:52:45,"Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Price Break the $200 Barrier This Month?","The post Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Price Break the $200 Barrier This Month? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) price is currently consolidating around the $175 mark, facing stiff resistance near the $185–190 level. Bullish chart patterns, including a symmetrical triangle breakout and golden cross, are fueling speculation of a move toward $200. But can SOL truly break past this critical resistance in July 2025? With a sharp rise in trading volume, ETF inflows, and Bitcoin’s ongoing rally, market sentiment is shifting. This article explores recent updates and technical indicators to assess whether a $200 breakout is achievable this month. Institutional Inflows Signal Growing Confidence in Solana Institutional interest in Solana surged notably in July 2025, marking a pivotal shift in how major investors view the blockchain. The launch of U.S.-based spot Solana ETFs, particularly the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), has attracted over $41 million in inflows within just days of its debut. Collectively, three newly launched Solana ETFs have accumulated nearly $78 million in assets under management, signaling strong early demand. Futures open interest on SOL has also climbed to over $7.5 billion, nearing historic highs—further reflecting heightened institutional engagement. Top asset managers such as Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton have filed for Solana ETF products, and JPMorgan analysts project potential net inflows of $3–6 billion over the next year if approvals proceed. With the SEC streamlining ETF review processes, Solana is fast becoming a key institutional asset—not just a high-speed blockchain, but a vehicle for regulated capital allocation. Will Solana (SOL) Price Reach $200 This Month? Solana’s price has recently surged to around $175, reflecting a strong rebound from the $155–160 support zone. With Bitcoin reclaiming the $112,000 mark, risk-on sentiment is returning to the crypto market, benefiting high-beta assets like SOL. However, the $200 target remains a psychological and technical hurdle. The price is currently stuck within an ascending triangle and is attempting to break through the neckline, which also serves as a crucial resistance zone to overcome. The CMF has risen above 0, with the OBV maintaining an upward trend, which suggests a strengthening of the bulls’ position. Therefore, a breakout could further promote a potential move to $200, which may extend to $215. However, the short-term targets could vary between $185 and $190, and a rise above this range could validate the bullish spell for the Solana (SOL) price rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-price-prediction-can-sol-price-break-the-200-barrier-this-month/,"SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T13:51:34,"The State of US Debt Refinancing in 2025: Can-Kicking, Short-Term Risk, and Crypto Market Implications","The State of US Debt Refinancing in 2025: Can-Kicking, Short-Term Risk, and Crypto Market Implications 1. Progress on US Debt Refinancing: How Much Is Done and What Remains As of mid-July 2025, the United States is navigating through one of the largest debt refinancing cycles in its history. For 2025, approximately $9.2 trillion in federal debt is due for refinancing—a figure that amounts to nearly a third of all outstanding US government debt and about 30% of GDP. Completed Refinancing (Jan–Jun 2025): Around $5 to $6.5 trillion of this year’s maturing debt has already been refinanced. This covers close to 55–70% of the total schedule, reflecting the typical front-loading strategy of Treasury auctions in the year's first half. Outstanding Refinancing (Jul–Dec 2025): An estimated $2.5 to $4 trillion remains to be rolled over by year-end. The Treasury will continue with regular auctions, but the bulk of the work—especially the spike in T-bill issuance—has set the tone for the remainder of the year. Year Total Due (USD Trillions) Already Refinanced Remaining 2025 9.2 5–6.5 2.5–4 2. The Short-Term T-Bill Strategy: Kicking the Can Down the Road Heavy Reliance on Short-Term Bills A defining feature of this refinancing round is the Treasury’s dependence on short-term Treasury bills (T-bills) —those maturing in one year or less. While the goal of extending average maturity persists, the majority of 2025's refinancing has been done via T-bills instead of longer-dated bonds. Estimated Share: About one-third of 2025 maturities originated as T-bills. Most new issuance has focused on instruments with maturities of 13, 26, or 52 weeks. Market Appeal: T-bills are attractive during uncertain or volatile times because they offer flexibility and are in high demand, but this has consequences. Risks: Larger Refinancing Wall in 2026 This tactic does not solve the long-term problem but simply delays it —a classic case of “kicking the can down the road.” By rolling over maturing debt with even more short-term debt, the Treasury ensures that 2026’s refinancing wall will also remain large , with about $7.6 trillion in debt coming due next year. The increased use of short-term maturities amplifies exposure to interest rate hikes. If interest rates rise, future rollovers will be at higher costs, straining the budget and potentially forcing difficult fiscal adjustments. Short-term refinancing creates frequent market risk events. Any disruption in Treasury markets—political standoffs, rate spikes, or liquidity crunches—could pose systemic risks to both the government and broader financial markets. 3. How Debt Refinancing Tactics May Impact the Crypto Market Macro Market Spillovers Volatility in Rates and Yields: Reliance on short-term debt makes Treasury yields more sensitive to policy shifts or market jitters. Sudden increases in government yields or failed auctions could spark capital flight from traditional assets, occasionally spilling over into higher demand for crypto as a hedge . Dollar Confidence and Alternatives: Aggressive short-termism raises questions about long-term fiscal stability and could negatively affect global confidence in the US dollar. Events that threaten “safe haven” status for Treasurys often lead some investors to diversify into non-sovereign assets— notably Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies . Risk-On/Risk-Off Moves: In scenarios where government fiscal health deteriorates or there is fear of US debt volatility, crypto assets may see speculative inflows as alternative or “risk-on” stores of value. However, crypto markets may also be hit by liquidity shocks if a crisis in Treasurys sparks a broad risk-off move where investors scramble for cash. Potential Outcomes to Watch Sharp Rate Increases: Could fuel a crypto rally as investors flee future inflation and currency debasement fears. Treasury Market Stress: May initially cause volatility across all assets—including crypto—but could ultimately drive renewed interest in decentralized stores of value. Policy Uncertainty: Heavy-handed or unpredictable moves (e.g., abrupt Fed changes or rate policies) may heighten appeal for assets outside the traditional financial system. Conclusion The US approach to refinancing this year’s vast debt wall—by focusing on short-term T-bills—offers flexibility but perpetuates fiscal risk, leaving a larger challenge for 2026 and beyond. These decisions reverberate beyond the Treasury market, with potential to shake the confidence in traditional financial assets and spur activity in crypto markets as investors seek out alternative stores of value.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/the-state-of-us-debt-refinancing-in-2025-can-kicking-short-term-risk-and-crypto-market-implications,"MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|FIAT","",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T13:45:07,"Father of Crypto Tycoon Vanishes As $1,000,000+ Drained from His Bank Accounts: Report","The father of a successful crypto investor is missing, and his family is worried he may have been kidnapped. Wen Hou, the chief investment officer of the private investment firm Coincident Capital, believes the disappearance of his father, Naiping Hou, could be tied to his crypto wealth. The younger Hou tells ABC7 Eyewitness News that he hasn’t seen his 74-year-old father since they went on a fishing trip in March. Authorities believe the elder Hou was abducted that month, according to the news outlet. Wen says he exchanged text messages with his father’s phone, but now believes the person he was texting wasn’t Naiping. Wen says Naiping, a resident of Rancho Cucamonga, California, previously would never pass up an opportunity to see his grandkids. “I have really young children, and we frequently ask him if he wants to come and visit us… He would refuse now… saying, ‘I’m tired,’ or ‘I can’t meet,’ or ‘I’ll call you later.'” Some of Wen’s family friends then went to check on Naiping’s house, but when they arrived, the home was empty. Wen says they later realized more than $1 million had been stolen from his father’s bank accounts. “Money was being wired out to buy gold online. He’s not an online-savvy person, so I don’t know how he’s able to buy gold online.” The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is looking into the matter, and Wen says his family is offering a $250,000 reward for critical info that could lead to a breakthrough in the case.

2025-07-17T13:40:02,"U.S. Marshals Hold 28,988 BTC—Far Less Than Thought, Records Show","The U.S. Marshals Service currently holds 28,988 BTC, a figure significantly lower than previously reported by various sources. This information was made public following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by journalist L0la L33tz, working on assignment for Bitcoin Magazine chairman David Bailey. Bailey had offered a $10,000 bounty for independently confirming the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. L0la L33tz explained the distinction between seized and forfeited assets, emphasizing that the U.S. Marshals Service is responsible specifically for coins that have been seized and subsequently forfeited—meaning they have been designated as government property by a court order. Only these assets can be lawfully sold by the government. She noted that popular on-chain data trackers often overestimate the government’s holdings, as they sometimes include assets that have only been seized but not yet legally forfeited. These coins may be under the control of agencies like the FBI, but they remain unsellable until a court’s forfeiture decision is issued. As an example, L0la L33tz cited the 94,000 BTC linked to the Bitfinex exchange hack. Though some trackers attribute these funds to the U.S. government, a judicial forfeiture decision has not yet been reached in the case. As a result, concerns about imminent government sales of these coins are premature. The Marshals Service typically sells forfeited cryptocurrencies through public auctions. While there are currently no announced sales planned, all 28,988 BTC remain on the agency’s books. Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm, had previously identified U.S. government-controlled wallets holding approximately $23.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The news drew criticism from some proponents of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis, for example, called the current situation a “strategic mistake.” “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins,” she commented.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10017/foia-response-uncovers-lower-than-expected-u-s-bitcoin-reserves,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Legal",cryptocompare

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand, especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 Chainlink Price Analysis 2025 (H1) Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 17.05333738 3.16% Market Cap $ 11,563,867,573.2434 Trading Volume $ 885,394,490.6238 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June onwards LINK showed bullish reawakening in the short term with BTC rallying and its price inching closer to retest the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum towards $24. The price is currently in an ongoing short-term rally near the $17 mark. Based on price action, a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if it breaks below $13, then it might pull back to $10. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) LINK Crypto Price Forecast July 2025 10 18 24 Chainlink Price Analysis 2025 (H1) In 2025, Chainlink price (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in April, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June onwards, the LINK price began to rise higher following the Bitcoin rally. Chainlink Price Forecast 2025 (H2) From the last week of June to July 17th, it has surged nearly 55% by the third week of July and it surged over 8% on June 17th as Sergey Nazarov mentioned on X that Chainlink standard is getting adopted across multiple financial ecosystems like Westpac and Imperium Markets. With the current bullish ongoing momentum this week, the LINK price is a hair away from retesting the neckline at $18 in July. However, the RSI showed caution in the short term, which could halt the movement near the neckline at $18, as the RSI has reached 75, indicating overheated overbought conditions. For the LINK price to advance higher, it needs to sustain itself in the long term. LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the fixed range high-volume profile level based on the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32. The second half of the year will be critical for LINK as it navigates these key resistance levels and aims for sustained growth.

Peter Brandt’s New Crypto Chart Analysis Says Yes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran market wizard Peter Brandt announces the beginning of an altcoin season. His recent tweet, “ It’s altcoin season ,” was backed by a convincing chart indicating a potential altcoin surge. With Bitcoin dominance hovering near historical levels that often spark altcoin rallies, and bullish chart patterns forming, investors are now wondering: is this the beginning of a major shift in 2025? Here’s what’s going on. Classic Chart Pattern Suggests Altcoin Breakout Brandt’s chart tracks the total crypto market cap, but excludes Bitcoin, and shows it currently at $1.39 trillion. What caught attention is the Cup and Handle pattern forming, a well-known bullish setup that often comes before sharp price moves. It's altcoin season pic.twitter.com/BShKyS6PDO — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 16, 2025 This same setup was seen before altcoins soared in the past. If history repeats, we could see the market cap for altcoins climb back toward the 2021 high of $1.7 trillion or even beyond. Bitcoin Dominance Hints at What’s Coming Right now, Bitcoin’s market dominance is around 64%. That number matters. In past cycles, when BTC dominance falls below 60%, altcoins tend to explode as traders start moving profits from Bitcoin into other assets. Analysts have been eyeing 2025 for a possible altcoin boom, with some already shifting attention toward large-cap coins and high-risk meme coins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE. If the current trend holds, the altcoin market might be gearing up for a major rally. Crypto Twitter Weighs In Not everyone agrees the rally has begun. Early Bitcoin investor and popular crypto YouTuber Jeremie Davinci shared a different view. “Altseason hasn’t started,” he said on X, “but when it’s here, most will be too late.” Altseason hasn’t started. But when it’s here, most will be too late. — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) July 17, 2025 Unlike many Bitcoin purists, Davinci doesn’t shy away from altcoins. He regularly talks about both large-cap and low-cap projects, and he often posts about trending meme coins too. Still, his focus lately has returned to Bitcoin’s long-term value. Brandt’s tweet didn’t go unnoticed by the crypto community. Reactions were mixed. Some agreed with the analysis and felt the signs were clear. Others were skeptical. One user even called it “ scam coin season ,” highlighting just how split opinions still are, even when technicals look promising. What Should Crypto Investors Expect Next? With Brandt calling for altcoin season and Davinci urging caution, investors find themselves at an interesting crossroads. Technical patterns are pointing to an altcoin run, but sentiment is still shaky and timing is everything in this market. If Bitcoin dominance drops and capital starts rotating into altcoins, we could see major moves across the board. But as always in crypto, nothing is guaranteed.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-altcoin-season-here-peter-brandts-new-crypto-chart-analysis-says-yes/,"ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

Ethereum ETFs Break Records Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded a historic influx of $726.6 million on Wednesday, which was the largest single-day net inflow for spot ETH ETFs to date. This happened as altcoins rallied sharply, with ETH itself climbing 8.6% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3,346. ETH’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with a record $499 million in daily inflows, while Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) followed with $113 million. This is according to data from Farside Investors . ETH ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) The new milestone beats the previous record of $428 million that was set on Dec. 5, 2024, by nearly 70%. Collectively, US spot Ether ETFs now hold more than 5 million ETH, which accounts for over 4% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. According to Ultra Sound Money, these funds bought roughly 107 times more ETH than was newly issued by the network on Wednesday alone. Ethereum’s momentum coincides with the broader altcoin resurgence . XRP is up 9.5%, BNB gained 3.04%, Solana rose 5.1%, Dogecoin increased 6.9%, Tron advanced 3.7%, and Cardano moved up 7.5%. In contrast, Bitcoin posted a modest 0.8% drop . Analyst Matthew Hyland pointed out that Bitcoin dominance, which currently stands at 61%, may have peaked. He suggested that if it falls to 45%, altcoins could see even stronger gains. Corporate demand for Ethereum has also been accelerating. Treasuries now hold over $5.33 billion worth of ETH, or approximately 1.33% of the circulating supply, according to the Strategic ETH Reserve . Just last month, corporations added over $1.6 billion in ETH. Among the largest buyers is SharpLink Gaming, which accumulated $343 million worth of ETH in just the past eight days, including a $68 million purchase in the last 24 hours, according to Lookonchain . (Source: Strategic ETH Reserve ) World Liberty Financial, a firm backed by US President Donald Trump, also disclosed a new $5 million ETH purchase at $3,266. Additionally, BitMine Immersion Technologies , chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, now holds over $500 million in ETH.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10014/ether-et-fs-see-record-726-m-inflow-as-altcoins-surge,"ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T13:25:33,"Ethereum Surges to Six-Month High Amid Record ETF Inflows and Institutional Demand","The price of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), rose 8.9% overnight to $3,452—its highest level since mid-January—according to CoinGecko. The rally was supported by record inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. According to TradingView’s daily ETH/USD chart from Binance, price momentum has been significant. SoSoValue reported that net inflows into nine US spot Ethereum ETFs totaled $726.74 million on July 16, led by BlackRock’s ETHA, which accounted for $499 million of the total. Since the beginning of July, spot ETH ETFs have attracted $2.27 billion in net inflows, setting a one-month record since their launch, and signaling ongoing robust investor demand. BTC Markets analyst Rachel Lucas believes that Ethereum is increasingly being viewed as a long-term institutional asset rather than just a speculative instrument. She noted that funds already own 4% of the altcoin’s total capitalization, indicating a rapid influx of capital from major players. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, attributed Ethereum’s momentum to the growing number of public companies investing in the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. The expanding participation of institutional investors is contributing to market stability and enhancing Ethereum’s reputation as a reliable component in diversified digital asset portfolios. ConsenSys-backed firm SharpLink Gaming became the largest corporate holder of ETH with approximately 280,600 ETH, overtaking the Ethereum Foundation, according to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve. Amid Ethereum’s surge, other altcoins also gained: XRP rose 7.8%, Solana climbed 5.7%, and BNB increased by 4.2%, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin added only 0.2% over the same period. The Bitcoin dominance index dropped by 2.59% over the week, down to 62.62%, according to TradingView. Lucas stated that a decline in this metric has historically preceded an “altcoin season.” Wave of Liquidations The rise in Ethereum’s price triggered forced liquidations of short positions totaling $177.67 million, as reported by Coinglass. These positions accounted for the majority of the $227.74 million in total crypto market liquidations over the past 24 hours. Losses for Bitcoin short sellers in the same period were just $45.33 million. Ethereum’s daily trading volume grew by 28% to $161 billion, surpassing that of Bitcoin ($109 billion). Open interest in Ethereum derivatives increased by 7%. Patrick Grun, founder of Perpetuals.com, believes that Ethereum’s price is highly sensitive to news regarding US regulation, which amplifies uncertainty and increases the asset’s volatility. According to him, the situation with Bitcoin has been comparatively more stable. Glassnode analysts reported that Ethereum is the only asset in the top 10 (other than stablecoins) with increasing daily futures trading volume, which grew by 27%. The financing rate remains neutral, indicating the emergence of new positions without signs of excessive leverage, experts concluded. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, added that the rate was negative from April to June, suggesting a prevalence of short positions in the market during that time. Amid these developments, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes announced the start of an “ETH season.” He stated that his venture fund Maelstrom plans to purchase tokens of “best-in-class” DeFi projects, seeing opportunities for strong performance compared to traditional markets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10016/ethereum-surges-to-six-month-high-amid-record-etf-inflows-and-institutional-demand,"ETH|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T13:22:08,"Bitcoin's Classic Bull-Bear Cycle Has Ended! These Will Determine the BTC Price From Now On!","Bitcoin (BTC)'s price has been determined by the four-year halving cycle. These halvings, which occur every four years, shape Bitcoin's price movements, both upward and downward. But this era may be over. K33 Research stated in its latest report that Bitcoin's traditional four-year bull-bear cycle may be coming to an end. This suggests that Bitcoin's halving-driven cycles are losing their former strength as mining rewards decline, and macroeconomic factors are increasingly driving the price. K33 Rsearch noted that Bitcoin has traditionally followed a predictable upward pattern to date, reaching all-time highs in the next year following four annual halving events seen in 2012, 2016, and 2020. According to historical data, Bitcoin has typically peaked approximately 1,060 days after the market bottom, indicating a potential peak by mid-October 2025 if the halving cycle holds true. However, K33 analysts argue that the halving trend is breaking down as Bitcoin evolves into a more stable financial asset and is widely adopted by institutional investors. “The impact of halvings is significantly less today than in the past. In previous years, halving events triggered surges by causing sudden supply shocks. But now, expanding institutional access, increased ETF access, and growing government interest have fundamentally changed Bitcoin's market dynamics. However, macroeconomic forces have become more influential and important in Bitcoin's price.” As a result, according to K33 Research's report, investors should focus on macro events such as inflation, interest rates, and global political tensions, which have been affecting the BTC price more recently, rather than focusing largely on the halving event. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-17T13:11:47,"Pakistan and El Salvador Team Up on Crypto — What It Means for the Best Presales Right Now","Pakistan and El Salvador have initiated a diplomatic alliance that puts crypto first. It’s the latest in a global shift to improving crypto regulation and adoption. Crypto is the ultimate winner here, and that includes the best crypto presales. On July 16, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele met with Bilal bin Saqib , Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) CEO and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain. Among the topics discussed were Bitcoin mining and energy resources, strategic Bitcoin reserves, and $BTC education. The result, as reported by Business Recorder, was the signing of a Letter of Intent to establish a formal framework of collaboration between El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office and the PCC. Leading the Bitcoin Charge Why is this meeting making headlines? Well, in 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal currency. Government policy also includes buying $BTC and, as of end-2024, it had amassed more than 5.9K Bitcoins . In other words, El Salvador is very crypto-friendly, and it was the first to set a trend that many governments, including Pakistan and the US, are finally beginning to follow. Pakistan, for its part, has been making definitive moves towards digital asset adoption. This strategic move is set to strengthen Pakistan’s already-growing crypto market. “The country ranks among the top in global crypto adoption, with an estimated $300B in annual crypto transactions and 25M active crypto users,” according to Pakistan’s Finance Ministry . Pakistan sits at the number nine spot in Chainanalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index , out of 151 nations. So far, 2025 has proven to be a busy year for Pakistan’s crypto strategy. In early May, it appointed Saqib to head the newly formed PCC. Around the same time, it also announced a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and AI data centers by allocating 2 gigawatts of electricity. That was in addition to launching its first government-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling long-term crypto commitment and aiming to attract global investment. Also in May, the government established the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA). It’s the PCC’s CEO, however, who’s actively taking the lead in making Pakistan the crypto capital of South Asia. Saqib’s responsibilities include driving efforts to regulate crypto under FATF guidelines , launching national $BTC mining, integrating blockchain across sectors, licensing Virtual Asset Service Providers, and growing Pakistan’s Web3 ecosystem. “Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines. We want to have regulatory clarity. We need to have a legal framework that is pro-business,” Saqib told Bloomberg earlier this year. “We need institutional adoption. We want banks, we want other enterprises to integrate with blockchain and not fight it. We want Pakistan to be a leader in blockchain-powered finance, and we want to attract international investment.” Crypto Boost To Benefit Presales Wider global adoption of crypto is great for the market. Case in point is the $BTC price , which hit an ATH last week, peaking at $123K just three days ago. It’s not just Bitcoin and little brother Ethereum that are reaping the rewards of widespread adoption. While institutional investors generally favor those two, smaller-cap altcoins have become the go-to for retail investors, according to a recent Wintermute report . With altcoin season about to hit, this segment is one to watch. That goes for the best presale altcoins too. Early-bird investment means buying in at a low cost, with potentially explosive gains down the line. Here’s a quick look at three in particular worth considering. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Unleashes the Power of Bitcoin With an L2 When it comes to blockchain security, nothing beats Bitcoin’s. But high transaction fees and a lack of scalability are issues that put many traders off. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps up to the plate. It is introducing an innovative Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) ecosystem that eradicates Bitcoin’s unpleasantries. Integrating the Solana Virtual Machine , $HYPER brings lower transaction costs and sub-second execution to the equation. That alone deserves a round of applause. But hold that thought, because it also introduces cross-chain compatibility, opening the door to meme coins, dApps, and DeFi. Three cheers all round. By the way, we took a look at $HYPER’s tokenomics and we liked what we saw. Of the total token supply of 21B, 30% is allocated to product development. That’s good, because this project will need to evolve if it wants to make good on its promise of scalability. Investor interest in this presale has also been strong, with $3.16M+ already raised. No doubt the concept of a Bitcoin L2 is driving that interest, but high staking rewards definitely sweeten the deal. Right now, you can buy $HYPER for $0.0123 – and stake it for 285% APY. Impressive, no? Discover how to purchase and stake your $HYPER in our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper . Don’t wait too long, though. Presale prices go up in stages, and the $HYPER price will increase tomorrow. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Backing Global Crypto Wallet Market Domination With both institutional and retail investment in crypto booming, that means good news for the crypto wallet market, too. It’s already a very lucrative segment, and one that’s set for exponential growth as crypto becomes more widely adopted. That puts the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in an excellent position. That’s because it’s the presale token driving the Best Wallet app ’s mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. Best Wallet stands an excellent chance of making good on its goal. As a leading crypto wallet , it’s a no-KYC, non-custodial, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet designed for crypto newbies and pros alike. And now $BEST is powering additional features and benefits for holders. Holding $BEST means lower transaction costs and higher staking rewards. You also enjoy governance rights, meaning you can have your say in the project’s direction and future features. What’s more, you can also buy the top presale tokens directly from the Best Wallet app. That, by the way, is an industry first. With $13.96M+ already in the $BEST kitty, this presale is going strong. Find out how to buy $BEST today for $0.025345 – and stake it for 98% APY rewards – by checking out our guide to buying Best Wallet Token . 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – A Fusion of Blockchain and AI for Next-Gen Apps. Lightchain AI (LCAI) is the token behind a decentralized system that will fuse blockchain and AI to power next-gen apps. At its core is the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), which is designed for AI task execution, and a Proof of Intelligence mechanism that incentivizes valuable computing work. By tackling key issues like scalability, trust, and data privacy, Lightchain AI will deliver a fair and secure environment for both users and developers, using blockchain transparency and AI strength to support dApps that solve real-world problems. The presale has already raised $21.77M+, and Stage 15 of the $LCAI presale was recently completed. The project has now launched a final Bonus Round ahead of its mainnet launch. That means one last chance to buy $LCA at the fixed presale price of $0.007125. ‘Tis the Season To Be Jolly Bullish sentiment abounds as more governments and institutions warm towards crypto. And that’s not only good for the crypto OGs – presale tokens are also coming along for the ride. However, whether $HYPER , $BEST , or $LCAI – or any crypto for that matter – has caught your attention, please be sure to always DYOR first. Knowledge is your best investment strategy to help lower your risk.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-presales-as-pakistan-and-el-salvador-team-up/,"BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T13:10:37,"Coinbase App Surge Unleashes Optimism for Retail Investor Return","BitcoinWorld Coinbase App Surge Unleashes Optimism for Retail Investor Return Are we on the cusp of a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape? Recent data suggests a resounding ‘yes,’ as the Coinbase app experiences a remarkable surge in its download rankings on the U.S. Apple App Store. This sudden ascent has ignited widespread speculation that retail investors are actively making their way back into the exciting, albeit volatile, crypto market . It’s a development that could signal a new phase of growth and renewed interest. What’s Behind the Remarkable Coinbase App Downloads? The numbers speak volumes. According to Sensor Tower data, Coinbase has rocketed from a humble 386th position to an impressive 137th in app download rankings over the past month. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant leap that catches the eye of anyone monitoring market sentiment. But why is this particular metric so important? Historically, the volume of app downloads for major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase has served as a powerful barometer for broader market activity. When more people are downloading the app, it often indicates a growing curiosity or direct intent to engage with digital assets. It’s the digital equivalent of foot traffic in a bustling financial district – a clear sign that something significant is brewing. Are Retail Investors Truly Returning to the Crypto Market? The correlation between Coinbase app downloads and overall market performance is not a new observation. Cointelegraph previously highlighted this trend in September of last year, noting a strong link between app popularity and price action. During previous market upswings, particularly the peaks of the last bull run , Coinbase consistently found itself within the top 175 positions in app download rankings. Conversely, when the market entered a bear phase, the app’s ranking typically plummeted below the 500th mark. The current jump to 137th position places the app firmly in territory historically associated with bullish sentiment. This suggests that a significant number of individual investors, who may have retreated during the prolonged crypto winter, are now feeling confident enough to re-engage. Their return is crucial, as retail participation often fuels the momentum needed for sustained market rallies. Key Indicators of Retail Investor Engagement: Increased App Downloads: As seen with Coinbase, a direct sign of new user acquisition or re-engagement. Social Media Buzz: Growing discussions and positive sentiment across platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and TikTok. Search Engine Trends: Higher search volumes for terms like “buy Bitcoin,” “crypto exchange,” or specific altcoins. Small-to-Medium Transactions: An uptick in transaction volumes on exchanges that are characteristic of individual traders rather than institutional players. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The resurgence in Coinbase app popularity is more than just a win for one exchange; it’s a potential harbinger for the entire crypto market . The influx of retail investors often brings fresh capital, increased liquidity, and a renewed sense of excitement that can propel prices upward. This renewed interest could be a foundational block for the next major market cycle. Consider the broader context: the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, and increasing institutional adoption are all contributing to a more optimistic outlook. When these macro factors combine with a surge in grassroots retail interest, the conditions for a robust bull run become increasingly favorable. Historical Context: App Downloads and Market Cycles Let’s look at the patterns: Coinbase App Ranking Market Condition Typical Retail Investor Activity Top 175 positions Bull Run / Peak Excitement High engagement, FOMO buying, new entrants 175-500 positions Transition / Accumulation Moderate engagement, cautious re-entry Below 500 positions Bear Market / Low Sentiment Low engagement, HODLing, withdrawals The current position of 137th firmly places us in the ‘Transition / Accumulation’ phase, leaning strongly towards the ‘Bull Run’ territory. This historical correlation provides a compelling argument for the significance of these app downloads . Challenges and Considerations for the Emerging Bull Run While the signs are undeniably positive, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The crypto space remains dynamic and subject to various influences. Challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations globally can impact market sentiment and investor confidence. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation or interest rate changes, can still exert pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Market Volatility: Even during a bull run , sharp corrections and significant price swings are common. Security Risks: Increased activity can also attract more bad actors, making robust security practices essential for investors. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Renewed Crypto Market For those considering re-entering or making their first foray into the crypto market , the surge in Coinbase app popularity serves as a powerful signal. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t just follow the hype. Understand the technology, use cases, and risks associated with any cryptocurrency before investing. Start Small and Diversify: Begin with an amount you’re comfortable losing and consider diversifying across different assets to mitigate risk. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps smooth out volatility and can be particularly effective during an emerging bull run . Prioritize Security: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes that could impact your investments. The landscape evolves rapidly. Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for Retail Investors The impressive ascent of the Coinbase app in download rankings is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of renewed confidence and engagement from retail investors . This grassroots enthusiasm, combined with broader positive market developments, paints a promising picture for the future of the crypto market . While challenges remain, the signs point towards an exciting period of growth and innovation, potentially heralding the early stages of a new bull run . As the digital asset space continues to mature, the active participation of individual investors will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping its trajectory.

2025-07-17T13:00:48,"Bitcoin’s 6-7-Week Theory Shows Where We Are In The Cycle","After being in existence for over 15 years, Bitcoin has established a number of trends that analysts across the board have pointed to for historical value. One of these trends that has been established is the number of weeks that the Bitcoin price has rallied in each cycle before it saw a major pullback . Due to the similarity of each cycle over the years, one trend has stood out in particular, and that is the 6-7 week trend that often predicted when a major Bitcoin correction was due. Understanding The 6-7-Week Bitcoin Theory In an X post, popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital explained how Bitcoin price corrections have worked in the past cycles in a bid to understand when the next correction could be on the way. Pointing to a recurring trend, the analyst first opened with the 2013 cycle when Bitcoin had rallied, showing how much time the cryptocurrency’s price rose before it began to fall. Back in 2013, the Bitcoin price had risen for the first six weeks after entering into price discovery. Only on the 7th week did the cryptocurrency see its first major correction. Next was the 2017 cycle when Bitcoin had gone into price discovery and rallied for upwards of seven weeks. This steady pattern pushed the price to new all-time highs after rallying for almost two months. Ultimately, it was not until the 8th week that BTC experienced its first major price correction. It would fall 34% during this time, signaling the end of the rally. Then, again, in the historic 2020-2021 rally, Bitcoin would enter into price discovery and for the next six weeks, it would rally relentlessly. Similar to before, the BTC price would only begin to retrace at the 7-week mark, falling 16% during this time. The same trend also played out in early 2025 when the Bitcoin price rallied for seven weeks before correcting by 32% to the $75,000 territory in the first quarter of the year. This shows an alternation between six and seven weeks of rallying before a major correction. But nevertheless, one thing remains constant: once Bitcoin enters into price discovery , it tends to have at least six weeks of runway before experiencing its first major correction. Where BTC Is In This Cycle The current rally has already seen the Bitcoin price break into the $120,000 territory, which is uncharted territory for the digital asset. However, as the analyst points out, the BTC price has only been rallying for two weeks so far after the cryptocurrency entered into price discovery. Going by the 6-7-week alternating trend, it raises the possibility that this price discovery will last for six weeks. Given that it is only Week 2, according to Rekt Capital, there is theoretically another month of upside to come before the Bitcoin price faces its first real rejection and subsequent correction. This could mean that the rest of the month of July will continue to be bullish for the crypto market, and move into the month of August. However, going by the 6-7-week theory, the end of August will be bearish for the market as the first correction, likely to be an above 30% correction, will happen around this time.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-6-7-week-theory/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T13:00:29,"Nearly 500 MetaMask Users Hacked Daily as Wallet Attacks Explode: Chainalysis","So far in 2025, cryptocurrency services have lost over $2.17 billion to theft and have already surpassed the damage seen across all of 2024. The bulk of these losses stems from the DPRK’s record-breaking $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, the largest incident in crypto’s history. Yet these are only part of the picture, as attackers have also ramped up direct wallet-targeting campaigns. In fact, Chainalysis reported that MetaMask attacks alone have surged to affect as many as 500 users daily. MetaMask Wallet Thefts Escalate According to the latest report shared with CryptoPotato , Chainalysis observed a troubling rise in anomalous stolen fund events targeting MetaMask users. The trend gained pace during late 2024 into 2025. While MetaMask has seen previous spikes in theft activity, especially during mid-2022 and late 2023, the recent incidents are significant for their increased severity and frequency. In some cases, nearly 500 MetaMask wallets were compromised in a single day during this period. A sharp spike on June 6, 2025, affecting around 226 wallets, further highlighted the utility of real-time anomaly detection on-chain in identifying coordinated attacks as they unfold. Chainalysis noted that these unusual surges could stem from several underlying factors, including potential vulnerabilities within wallet software that attackers are systematically exploiting, as seen in past incidents like the Atomic Wallet hack. In addition to that, compromised third-party infrastructure, such as malicious browser extensions or dApps, may be facilitating these thefts. The data may also reflect broader crypto adoption, which expands the target pool for attackers and makes large-scale wallet attacks more visible in aggregate data. “The growth in anomalous events affecting MetaMask users into 2025 suggests that malicious actors might be deliberately targeting widely-used wallet applications in the crypto ecosystem and that continued adoption of crypto could increase these numbers in the future.” Violence and Crypto A disturbing subset of personal wallet theft involves “wrench attacks,” where criminals use physical violence or coercion to force individuals to hand over their crypto holdings. Data indicates that 2025 is on track to record nearly double the number of such physical attacks compared to any previous year. Since many incidents go unreported, the actual count is likely much higher. Analysis also shows a clear correlation between these violent attacks and a forward-looking moving average of Bitcoin’s price, which suggests that rising asset values, or even expectations of future price increases, may trigger further opportunistic assaults on known crypto holders.
