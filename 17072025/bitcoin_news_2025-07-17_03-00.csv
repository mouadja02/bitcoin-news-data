2025-07-17T00:37:15,"UK ministers push for ban on crypto donations","The ministers of the British government are sounding the alarm about cryptocurrency as a possible vehicle to launder foreign money, pay bribes, and finance political campaigns. They call it an existential threat to the country‚Äôs democracy. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden said there is a strong case for making crypto donations illegal in the UK. He was responding to Labor MP Liam Byrne, who had asked if the government was reviewing a crypto ban in political funding, which was ordered during the Beitbridge inquiry into xenophobia. During Parliament‚Äôs summer recess, McFadden emphasized the need for the UK to update its political finance laws to preserve public trust continuously. He said it was important to know who the donation was received from, whether it was correctly registered, and to understand the entire path of money in and out to assure the donation was safe. The concern is that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can move across borders without being attached to names, banks, or identities. That is the tricky part for officials when trying to track the trail of money and verify that it is the source of the donation. To one set of people, crypto is a clear-eyed modern method of raising money; to another, it is a potential opening into the shadowy and potentially illicit world of campaign finance. Reform UK Bitcoin move sparks outrage It is just two months since Reform UK , led by Nigel Farage, said the party would begin taking donations in Bitcoin. The move made Reform UK the first UK political party to take donations in cryptocurrency publicly. Although many have hailed it as a metric innovation, the regulators and watchdogs are worried about that. A UK-registered anti-corruption charity warned in a recent report that accepting cryptocurrency donations could open up British politics to the dangers of foreign interference and the proceeds of crime. The report said digital assets like crypto could be used in ‚Äúfuture political interference schemes,‚Äù especially if combined with lax oversight. McFadden and Byrne urged the government to ensure that institutions regulating political financing are strong. They called for greater resources and power for the National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission, which monitors and investigates donations to political parties. Governments tighten rules on crypto funding It‚Äôs not just Britain that is worried. Elsewhere in the world, other countries are considering regulating or banning cryptocurrency donations to politics . Like many democracies, Ireland aimed to shield its democracy from ‚Äúforeign interference,‚Äù fake news, and clandestine campaign financing. It‚Äôs different in the United States, state by state. A handful of states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have outlawed donations made in cryptocurrency altogether. They raised questions around traceability and transparency. Some states, like California, had bans in place but rolled back those restrictions so money from crypto could again flow into campaigns, as happened when the new year arrived. However, in countries with weak oversight, the risks are even greater. For example, El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender, permits political donations in cryptocurrency. Civic groups have cautioned that external forces can easily manipulate the democratic process anonymously.

2025-07-17T00:00:17,"Bitcoin Holders Capitulate: Nearly 50K BTC Sold At A Loss in 24 Hours","Bitcoin is entering a pivotal moment as the US Congress kicks off ‚ÄúCrypto Week,‚Äù where lawmakers will debate and vote on landmark cryptocurrency legislation. The decisions made this week could shape the regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States for years to come‚Äîand investors are watching closely. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is holding above critical support levels after recently setting a new all-time high of $123,200 and retracing to key demand near the $116,000‚Äì$118,000 zone. Despite the pullback, the broader trend remains bullish, with the price structure intact and support levels being defended by buyers. However, fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals signs of investor capitulation following Tuesday‚Äôs sharp correction. On-chain metrics show a significant spike in volume, with large sales recorded as Bitcoin fell, an indication that some holders may have exited positions in panic. This wave of selling added short-term pressure but also potentially flushed out weaker hands, setting the stage for a more stable recovery. Panic Selling Surfaces As Investors Dump 50K Bitcoin At A Loss Top analyst Axel Adler has shared key data revealing that nearly 50,000 BTC were sold at a loss in the last 24 hours‚Äîone of the largest capitulation events seen in recent months. This sharp wave of selling came on the heels of Bitcoin‚Äôs retrace from its all-time high of $123,200, and it reflects clear signs of panic in the market. The data suggests many investors exited positions below their entry points, a classic sign of capitulation among weaker hands. While this might appear alarming, such events often precede a continuation of bullish price action, especially in strong uptrends. By shaking out uncertain holders, the market may now be positioned for healthier, more sustainable growth, driven by long-term conviction rather than speculative noise. However, broader uncertainty remains. On Tuesday, all three major crypto bills were rejected in the US Congress during the opening of ‚ÄúCrypto Week,‚Äù raising concerns over the lack of regulatory clarity for digital assets. This unexpected legislative setback could fuel short-term hesitation from institutional investors awaiting clearer rules of engagement. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals and on-chain metrics remain strong. Exchange reserves are low, long-term holder supply remains steady, and network activity continues to rise. Moreover, the recent uptick in retail demand and altcoin participation points toward a potential expansion phase, not just for Bitcoin, but for the broader crypto market. BTC Holds Strong After Sharp Correction The 8-hour Bitcoin chart shows that BTC is holding up well after a volatile drop from its all-time high of $123,200. The price retraced sharply to the $115,700 level but found immediate support, printing a bullish wick and now trading around $118,800. Despite the correction, the structure remains bullish, with higher lows and higher highs still intact. Importantly, the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs (Simple Moving Averages) are aligned to the upside, confirming a strong uptrend. BTC is also holding well above the key support level of $109,300, previously a major resistance zone, which now acts as a crucial demand area. If bulls manage to maintain momentum and reclaim the $120,000 zone, a retest of all-time highs is likely. Volume during the drop spiked significantly, suggesting either panic selling or a well-executed shakeout of weak hands. However, the fast recovery indicates strong underlying demand and continued conviction among long-term holders.

2025-07-17T00:00:13,"Massive Whale Profits $15 Million‚ÄîNow Betting Big On Ethereum To Crash","A well-known crypto whale has made a big move against Ethereum, opening a $62.42 million short position using 18x leverage. The trader, identified by the wallet address ‚Äú0x2258‚Ä¶‚Äù, is betting heavily that ETH won‚Äôt climb anytime soon‚Äîand so far, the gamble is paying off. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions‚ÄîIs Real-World Use Finally Here? Based on blockchain data monitored via Hyperdash, the whale shorted 20,474 ETH at an entry point of $3,060. As ETH has been trading at levels lower than $3,000 at the time of writing, the whale is already enjoying an unrealized profit of approximately $1.14 million, or returns of 30%. Ethereum Under Pressure Below $3,500 The liquidation value of the position is at $3,505 ‚Äî near where ETH traded previously in January 2025. That point is now serving as very powerful resistance. If the price exceeds that level, the position stands to be completely liquidated. Whale 0x2258, who‚Äôs already made over $15M, is shorting $ETH with 18x leverage, holding a position of 20,474 $ETH($62.5M). This whale has previously profited big by trading against James Wynn.https://t.co/BALllYbUXbhttps://t.co/NhOE1YD4QN pic.twitter.com/7k5ZE81Noa ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 Despite that narrow buffer, the trader seems confident. The use of 18x leverage suggests a high-conviction call that ETH will drop further or, at the very least, won‚Äôt bounce past that resistance level in the short term. This kind of heavy shorting is raising eyebrows in a market that‚Äôs still undecided on whether Ethereum can regain bullish momentum alongside Bitcoin. Track Record Of Outsmarting James Wynn This isn‚Äôt the first time ‚Äú0x2258‚Ä¶‚Äù has stepped in with bold trades. The wallet has gained a reputation for taking positions that go directly against crypto influencer James Wynn‚Äîoften with profitable results. Back in May, Wynn went long on ETH and Bitcoin. Almost immediately, 0x2258 shorted both. When Wynn closed his positions, 0x2258 did the same and walked away with $1.36 million. The next day, as Wynn flipped bearish, 0x2258 went long and bagged another $2.54 million. The back-and-forth continued. By May 26, the whale had locked in $5.6 million in profits in just three days. Since then, the strategy has snowballed into more than $15 million in realized gains, most of it from flipping against Wynn‚Äôs positions.

Traders like 0x2258 appear to believe that ETH lacks the strength right now to push past the $3,500 level. Still, shorting with this level of leverage is a double-edged sword. If ETH bounces sharply, traders like 0x2258 could get caught in a squeeze, forced to buy back in at a loss‚Äîdriving the price up even faster. So far, though, the whale is winning again. Whether it ends in another multi-million-dollar gain or a hard reset depends on what ETH does next. For now, the market is waiting to see what happens next.
