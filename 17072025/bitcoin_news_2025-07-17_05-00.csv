2025-07-17T02:00:15,"Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst","Ethereum is flashing signs of an aggressive upside move, with well-known crypto analyst Kaleo (@CryptoKaleo) forecasting what he described as a ‚ÄúGod candle‚Äù that could propel ETH beyond the $4,000 mark within days. In a post on X, Kaleo wrote: ‚ÄúGod candle to $4K+ this week‚Ä¶ honestly though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see something like this play out after today‚Äôs news. Don‚Äôt let them shake you out if it happens anon. up only soon.‚Äù In Kaleo‚Äôs chart, the Ether‚ÄìUSDT pair is sketched inside an ascending wedge whose upper boundary has capped every rally for more than three months. That resistance line now sits near $3,000, while the lower boundary originates near $1,450 in early April and accelerates through $2,600 by late June. Ethereum Breakout Fuels $4,000 Hopes The pattern briefly failed in mid-June, when price sliced through support and bottomed near $2,100‚Äîan episode Kaleo tags ‚ÄúBreakdown.‚Äù Three week later the market closed decisively back above that very line, an event he annotates ‚ÄúReclaim,‚Äù converting former support turned resistance back into a springboard. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout Candles since the reclaim have marched steadily higher, compressing volatility against the wedge‚Äôs apex until earlier this week when price punched through the ceiling at roughly $3,030. At the moment the screenshot was taken the pair traded near $3,041, and a hand-drawn white projection‚Äîlabelled ‚ÄúSend‚Äù‚Äîplots a near-vertical advance that crests just above $4,000. The projection takes its height from the widest section of the wedge: the distance between the early-May trough and the mid-May swing high measures a little over $1,000; adding that amplitude to the breakout point delivers a classical measured-move objective in the low-$4,000s, matching Kaleo‚Äôs target. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys $73M in Ethereum ‚Äì Smart Money Loads the Dip Also importantly, price has reclaimed the psychological $3,000 handle on convincing momentum, turning what had been the midpoint of the range into fresh support. Intermediate friction zones appear near $3,344‚Äìthe 0.618 Fibonacci retracement also known as the ‚Äúgolden pocket‚Äì but the projection assumes these levels will offer little resistance should a ‚Äúgod candle‚Äù materialise. Kaleo‚Äôs prediction comes on the heels of a broader risk‚Äëon backdrop: Bitcoin is accelerating towards its record high near $123,000 from last week as investors embrace a steadier macro environment. For Ether specifically, enthusiasm has been amplified by an SEC filing revealing that Peter‚ÄØThiel‚Äôs Founders Fund accumulated a 9.1‚ÄØpercent stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the Tom‚ÄØLee‚Äëchaired public company that has stockpiled more than 163,000‚ÄØETH‚Äîroughly half a billion dollars‚Äô worth‚Äîas part of an aggressive Ethereum‚Äëtreasury strategy. The twin tailwinds of macro‚Äëdriven liquidity and high‚Äëprofile venture endorsement reinforce Kaleo‚Äôs thesis that a ‚Äúgod candle‚Äù toward the $4,000 mark could ignite before the week draws to a close. At press time, ETH traded at $3,225.

2025-07-17T02:00:07,"100% Unlock for BlockDAG Buyers for 10 Days, as SHIB Turns to AI & AAVE Reaches $50B Milestone","The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem continues to build momentum as Bitcoin‚Äôs surge boosts altcoins. With new AI features and metaverse updates, SHIB is gaining renewed attention. At the same time, the AAVE market analysis shows strong progress, with Aave crossing $50 billion in deposits and breaking through important price zones. While these projects gain traction, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a different kind of opportunity. Its NO VESTING PASS allows all buyers within a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their purchased BDAG coins at launch. Combined with its current $0.0016 entry rate, this move has drawn high activity and is helping BlockDAG stand out as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market right now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ecosystem Moves Ahead with AI and Metaverse Features The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is showing growth as the total crypto market cap reaches $3.81 trillion, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs latest rally. SHIB regained an $8 billion market cap, rising nearly 17% in a week, while BONE, LEASH, and TREAT also saw steady gains. Teased updates under the ‚ÄúJul-AI‚Äù label suggest AI-based tools are coming soon, and the metaverse experience has improved performance. These upgrades point to a stronger phase for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, helped by rising on-chain activity and continued community focus on what‚Äôs coming next. AAVE Market Analysis Shows Strength Above $50 Billion Deposits The latest AAVE market analysis shows that Aave has now passed $50 billion in total deposits. This marks a major point in the growth of decentralized finance. Aave operates across 34 blockchains and has support from both fintech partners and traditional financial firms. Tools like Aave Arc and the planned V4 release are adding real-world asset features. The AAVE coin has now cleared key levels at $303.38 and $317.90 and trades close to $326. Based on AAVE market analysis, the next resistance zone is around $340 to $345. Market behavior points to steady support for Aave‚Äôs services and overall utility. Unlock All BDAG Instantly: BlockDAG‚Äôs 10-Day NO VESTING Pass Opens Early Access BlockDAG has launched a special NO VESTING PASS, giving buyers a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their BDAG at launch. Most presales require long waiting periods before coins can be accessed, often lasting months or even a year. This pass changes that pattern, offering full access from the start for any BDAG bought during this short time. Only purchases made during this 10-day period qualify. Referral bonuses and promotional rewards will still follow the usual release timeline. The NO VESTING PASS adds a level of flexibility rarely seen in early-stage crypto projects, helping users take full control of their purchase from day one. This limited offer runs alongside BlockDAG‚Äôs ongoing presale, which has now raised nearly $340 million toward its $600 million goal. Nearly 24 billion BDAG have already been sold. The price began at $0.001 in the first batch and has grown to $0.0276 by batch 29, showing a 2,660% increase. Still, BDAG is available at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare pricing model has attracted strong demand and added to BlockDAG‚Äôs visibility as one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects in the market today. While pricing and presale data show strong activity, there is growing discussion around BDAG‚Äôs potential. Some analysts believe the price could eventually reach $5. The combination of the NO VESTING PASS, special entry price, and market attention has made this a key moment for those tracking the project. By offering early access and keeping terms clear, BlockDAG is gaining interest from people across the space. Insight Into the Broader Market The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is building momentum with AI tools and metaverse updates. These changes could help it gain more attention and compete for a place among the most popular cryptocurrency platforms. At the same time, AAVE market analysis shows the platform holding steady in the DeFi world. With growing real-world asset use and more institutional activity, AAVE remains a name to follow. BlockDAG offers something different. The NO VESTING PASS allows all coins bought in its short 10-day offer to be fully unlocked at launch. Alongside its fast-selling presale and a rising user base, it has quickly become the most popular cryptocurrency this week. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release getting closer, many are watching what happens next as this phase continues to unfold.
