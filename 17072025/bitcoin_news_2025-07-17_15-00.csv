2025-07-17T13:00:00,"Bitmine Immersion: Capitalizing On Renewed Crypto Enthusiasm, Likely To End Badly","Summary Bitmine Immersion Technologies is capitalizing on renewed crypto enthusiasm, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum price surges. Bitmine Immersion recently announced a $250 million PIPE deal to acquire Ethereum, signaling a major strategic pivot. Despite a 75% stock price pullback from July highs, I view BMNR stock as egregiously overvalued at current levels. My rating reflects concerns about valuation and dilution from a fresh $2 billion ATM. BitMine Immersion Technologies Overview With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fresh off yet another new all-time price high and market sentiment about Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) rapidly improving, there has been a surge in public companies looking to benefit from the recent rise in digital asset prices. One such company is BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ). That company has made a series of headlines in recent weeks and enjoyed a massive stock price moonshot. Even after a sizable pullback, shares are currently up over 800% over the last month. Data by YCharts In this piece, we'll briefly look at BitMine's operations, the recent capital raise strategy, and what I view to be an egregiously overvalued stock even after a 75% pullback from an early-July high of $161 per share. BitMine Immersion Operations 'A Bitcoin Network Company' (Bitminetech.io) Prior to pivoting to an Ethereum treasury strategy in June, BitMine Immersion considered itself a Bitcoin company. In fact, the company's website still states that BitMine is ""A Bitcoin Network Company"" and lists Next-Gen Mining, Mining-as-a-Service, and Bitcoin Treasury Consulting as primary operations for its business. BitMine The picture above is from an investor deck dated June 2025 ; the slide presenting BitMine's strategic vision made no mention of Ethereum as a core focus for the company and stated support for mass adoption of Bitcoin. To be sure, BitMine's operations have been reliant on BTC rather than ETH: Data by YCharts During the quarter-ended May 2025, BitMine generated $2.05 million in top line revenue for a gross profit of $490k. While the last quarter was indeed BitMine's best quarter in the last 5 years from a revenue generation standpoint, this is not a business that has ever generated positive net income on an annual basis. BitMine Revenue By Segment (BitMine 10-Q) Breaking the revenue out shows more than half of the company's revenue coming from asset leasing in the quarter. This is a new segment for BitMine and the revenue from leasing is entirely reliant on one client, KULR Technology Group, which is leasing 3,000 ASICs owned by BitMine. KULR is also the only client in BitMine's custody business. Thus, one client accounted for at least 54% of BitMine's revenue last quarter. Through two different lease agreements in March and May, KULR committed to pay BitMine $4 million through December. The company has an advanced payment of $1.4 million from KULR. Looking at the balance sheet through May, we see a company that had very little in the way of shareholder equity for a $31 million market cap at the end of the month: Balance Sheet (BitMine 10-Q) BitMine had less than $1.5 million in cash and a $1.9 million loan payable to a company owned by BitMine's CEO. Subsequent to the filing, that loan has been satisfied. Of the company's $8.3 million in total assets, $3.1 million of BitMine's Property and Equipment was classified as 'not in service.' Those assets were made up of immersion containers, immersion fluid and 15 transformers. In my view, these end of May numbers show a capital raise was clearly needed. And the company has done just that in a major way. Share Offering, PIPE, and ATM June 6th Prospectus (BitMine) Early in June, the company sold 2,250,000 shares at $8.00 per share. Net proceeds from that sale were $16,150,000 million with the expressed purpose of purchasing Bitcoin. However, just a few weeks after raising over $16 million to buy BTC, BitMine did a $250 million Private Investment in Public Equity agreement to build an Ethereum Treasury. Notably included in that PIPE were Pantera, Kraken, Galaxy Digital ( GLXY ), Grayscale-parent Digital Currency Group, and Fundstrat's Tom Lee. Lee is also a notable CNBC contributor as well as the Chairman of BitMine's board of directors. The pricing on that PIPE was $4.50 per share - a 43% discount to the pricing of BitMine's share offering earlier in the month. We also now know that Peter Thiel was included in the PIPE as well and currently owns 9.1% of the company. As far as I can tell, there is no information yet pertaining to when those $4.50 PIPE shares will unlock. ETH Treasury Rankings (Strategic eth reserve.xyz) What we do know is BitMine disclosed a $2 billion ATM on July 9th and has seemingly already put that to significant work since the company now claims to hold $500 million in ETH . For all intents and purposes, BMNR is now an ETH-proxy stock with very little relation to the Bitcoin mining operations that it reported in its latest 10-Q. BMNR Stock Valuation This all brings us to the valuation. At July 14th share prices, $250 million in additional capital from the ATM likely required issuing somewhere between 4 and 6 million new common shares. If we split the difference and call it 5 million shares, we can reasonably assume there are now at least 65 million BNMR common shares outstanding after the 2.3 million raised in early June and the 55.6 million from the PIPE. At a July 16th share price close of $44.8, I estimate BitMine Immersion now has a market capitalization of $2.9 billion and ETH holdings of $500 million. Closing Thoughts In no world does this valuation for BNMR make sense. The company closed July 16th trading at nearly 6x the liquidation value of the claimed ETH assets. And this doesn't even get into the optics of this whole operation - which I personally find to be concerning. At a nano-cap valuation, the company raised a quarter million dollars from well-known crypto bulls who have large platforms. Those shares immediately exploded in value due, in part, to the notoriety of the investors who took part in the PIPE as well as the market's current exuberance for anything that mentions a digital asset 'treasury' in a press release. BitMine immediately announced a $2 billion ATM and will presumably continue to utilize a cash raising instrument that it never would have been able to attain a month ago. There is no meaningful business operation that would justify this share price and the stock is wildly overvalued relative to the assets it holds. I wouldn't walk, I'd run from BMNR.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801800-bitmine-immersion-capitalizing-renewed-crypto-enthusiasm-likely-end-badly?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|BTC|ETH|TRADING|MARKET","ETH-USD|BMNR",cryptocompare

In a new interview on CNBC’s Closing Bell, Chris Hyzy says the explosion of spending on AI represents a boom that will boost the markets for years to come. “If you look out over the next six or seven years and we just kind of pause for a second in the next week or two weeks, the greatest capex boom that we are going to witness is yet to come. We’ve got trillions yet to go. There’s billions that have been deployed in terms of what has been announced but in terms of actual input into the actual infrastructure, the digital infrastructure space, it’s just beginning.” Hyzy says that amid the long-term bullish market conditions, certain sectors still offer investors potential bargain buys. “Weakness in financials, industrials, utilities, information technology, those areas are buying opportunities even though we’re at all-time highs… In our opinion, you could potentially be looking at another double in the S&P, which is not a lot of heavy lifting because that matches the return that we’ve seen in markets over the last six, seven, eight decades.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-17T12:20:23,"Bitcoin Mining: French Lawmakers Propose Groundbreaking Nuclear Energy Bill","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: French Lawmakers Propose Groundbreaking Nuclear Energy Bill Imagine a world where the energy needed to power the global Bitcoin network comes from clean, abundant sources, not from burning fossil fuels. This isn’t just a distant dream; it is becoming a tangible possibility, particularly in France. Recent developments indicate a significant shift in perspective, as French lawmakers have introduced a pioneering bill aimed at harnessing the nation’s often-debated surplus nuclear power for Bitcoin mining . This innovative proposal seeks to transform a perceived energy excess into a substantial economic asset, potentially generating up to $150 million in annual revenue. This initiative could mark a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, offering a blueprint for more sustainable and economically beneficial crypto mining operations worldwide. French Lawmakers’ Vision: A New Era for Bitcoin Mining? The core of the proposed legislation, as reported by CryptoSlate, centers on a five-year pilot program designed to strategically utilize France’s abundant, and at times, surplus nuclear energy for energy-intensive Bitcoin operations. This move by French lawmakers is not merely an opportunistic venture; it represents a thoughtful approach to leveraging existing infrastructure while addressing the energy consumption concerns often associated with cryptocurrencies. France, with its robust nuclear fleet, frequently produces more electricity than it consumes, especially during off-peak hours. This surplus energy, which might otherwise be curtailed or sold at low prices, could now find a highly profitable application. The potential economic benefits are significant. With an estimated annual revenue generation of $150 million, this pilot program could provide a substantial boost to the French economy. Beyond direct revenue, it could foster job creation in the digital infrastructure sector, attract further investment in clean energy technologies, and position France as a leader in sustainable blockchain innovation. It is a strategic move that aligns economic growth with environmental responsibility. The Power of Nuclear Energy in Crypto Mining Why nuclear energy ? The answer lies in its unique characteristics. Unlike intermittent renewable sources like solar or wind, nuclear power provides a stable, baseload supply of electricity 24/7. This consistency is highly desirable for Bitcoin mining , which requires a continuous and reliable power source to maintain profitability. Furthermore, nuclear energy is a low-carbon source, producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, which directly addresses one of the most significant criticisms leveled against Bitcoin’s environmental footprint. The concept of using ‘surplus’ energy is crucial here. France’s nuclear power plants operate most efficiently when running at full capacity. However, demand fluctuates. When demand is low, the excess power can be challenging to manage. Instead of curtailing production or exporting cheap electricity, directing this surplus to energy-intensive activities like crypto mining presents an elegant solution. It transforms a potential liability into an asset, optimizing grid stability and energy utilization. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional fossil fuel-based mining operations, offering a pathway towards truly sustainable digital asset creation. Is Sustainable Crypto Mining Finally Within Reach? The global conversation around Bitcoin’s energy consumption has often been heated, with critics pointing to its carbon footprint. However, initiatives like the one proposed by French lawmakers offer a compelling counter-narrative. By intentionally seeking out and utilizing clean, often wasted, energy sources, the industry can significantly mitigate its environmental impact. This isn’t just about reducing emissions; it’s about pioneering a model where digital innovation and environmental stewardship go hand-in-hand. The potential for renewable energy sources to power the crypto industry is immense. While solar and wind are critical components of a green energy future, their intermittency can be a challenge for constant operations like mining. Nuclear power, with its consistent output, complements these renewables by providing a stable foundation. This integrated approach, where various clean energy sources are strategically deployed, could pave the way for a future where crypto mining is predominantly powered by sustainable means, shifting the narrative from energy drain to energy innovation. Key Aspects of Sustainable Mining: Energy Source Diversification: Utilizing a mix of nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind. Load Balancing: Using mining as a flexible load to stabilize grids. Waste Heat Utilization: Exploring ways to repurpose heat generated by mining operations. Policy & Regulation: Governments encouraging green mining practices through incentives. Economic Opportunities and Challenges for Crypto Mining in France The proposed bill presents a wealth of economic opportunities for France. Beyond the direct revenue from Bitcoin mining , the initiative could stimulate significant technological advancements within the country. It could attract global crypto companies looking for stable, green energy solutions, leading to foreign investment and the development of specialized expertise in high-performance computing and energy management. Furthermore, the pilot program could serve as a model for other nations with similar energy profiles, fostering international collaboration in sustainable digital infrastructure. However, no ambitious project is without its challenges. Public perception of crypto mining , often associated with high energy use, will need careful management. Clear communication about the use of surplus and renewable energy will be vital to gain public support. Regulatory hurdles, including ensuring compliance with existing energy and financial laws, will also need to be navigated. Technical implementation, such as integrating mining facilities with existing nuclear grid infrastructure, will require meticulous planning and execution. Additionally, the volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price could impact the profitability projections, necessitating a flexible and adaptable framework. Potential Benefits: Revenue Generation: Up to $150 million annually. Grid Optimization: Efficient use of surplus nuclear power. Technological Leadership: Positioning France as an innovator in sustainable crypto. Job Creation: Growth in tech and energy sectors. Potential Challenges: Public Perception: Overcoming negative stereotypes about crypto energy use. Regulatory Framework: Developing robust and adaptable policies. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless operation with energy grids. Market Volatility: Managing revenue fluctuations due to Bitcoin price swings. A Bold Step Towards a Sustainable Digital Future The proposal by French lawmakers to leverage surplus nuclear energy for Bitcoin mining is more than just an economic venture; it’s a statement about the future of digital assets and energy. It signifies a growing recognition that cryptocurrencies, when powered responsibly, can be part of a sustainable energy ecosystem rather than a drain on resources. This pilot program, if successful, could provide a powerful template for other nations, demonstrating how innovation, economic opportunity, and environmental responsibility can converge. As the world grapples with energy transitions and the increasing demand for digital infrastructure, France’s bold move could illuminate a path towards a truly green and prosperous future for crypto mining .

Capital is rotating into altcoins, and confidence is rising across the board. In this wave of bullish momentum, companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are stealing the spotlight for their aggressive Bitcoin adoption. Now, Strategy has secured a place among the t op 100 U.S. public companies , signaling how deeply Bitcoin has penetrated traditional finance. Strategy is accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, while back then many rejected their idea as a gamble, in 2025, it is a live example of building a billion-dollar empire by just adding small BTC constantly. They made every dip count. Strategy Climbs to Top 100 with $128.5 Billion Valuation Strategy’s market cap has hit a record $128.5 billion, placing it among America’s 84th-largest public companies. Just five years ago, it was worth under $2 billion. This dramatic growth is driven by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-centric playbook, turning the firm from a legacy software business into the largest corporate BTC holder. The company now holds 601,550 BTC, worth over $70 billion, making it a de facto Bitcoin ETF for equity investors. Its stock currently trades at $455.90, roughly 15% below its all-time high, but remains a favorite for investors betting on Bitcoin’s long-term upside. Bold Fundraising and Share Expansion Strategy’s transformation has been fueled by massive capital raises and share expansion. Since 2020, its share count has nearly tripled to 281.9 million through ATM offerings, a 10-for-1 stock split in 2024, and stock-based compensation. In late 2024, Strategy unveiled a $42 billion capital-raising plan, following a $21 billion raise the prior quarter. These funds have been funneled almost entirely into Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now acts as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy, with diluted shares outstanding estimated at 315.1 million, reflecting future conversions from debt and options. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins , Analyst Sees Breakout Ahead Crypto analyst Sean Trades recently shared a positive outlook for Strategy’s stock (MSTR).

2025-07-17T12:08:34,"Why Meme Coins Are Surging Today: FLOKI, BONK, and Pudgy Penguins in Focus","The post Why Meme Coins Are Surging Today: FLOKI, BONK, and Pudgy Penguins in Focus appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In just the last 24 hours, meme coins have surged by 7.2%, led by standout performances from FLOKI, Bonk, and the unexpectedly booming Fartcoin. FLOKI alone has shot up by a massive 32.8%, while Bonk jumped 16.2%, and Fartcoin rallied 23.5%. Other notable gains include Dogecoin up 7.4%, Shiba Inu by 5.5%, and Pepe by 6%. This rally comes as the crypto market rides a wave of bullish sentiment, fueled by signs of an incoming altseason and renewed momentum behind the pro-crypto GENIUS Act in the U.S . The current total market cap of meme coins stands at an impressive $79.87 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. Apart from Pudgy Penguins and Pump.fun, all other top meme coins have seen notable green candles. But what’s fueling this meme coin madness? Let’s break it down. FLOKI, Bonk, and Fartcoin Dominate the Charts FLOKI has taken center stage . With a 24-hour trading volume explosion of over 402%, the coin has managed a 42% rise over the past seven days, and its market cap now sits at $1.28 billion. This kind of sustained momentum, combined with community hype, is creating serious FOMO across social platforms. Bonk, the Solana-based meme coin, is riding high too. It’s gained nearly 69% over the week, with 16.2% of that coming just in the last day. With its market cap nearing $3 billion and trading volume surpassing it, Bonk’s surge is closely tied to Solana’s increasing DeFi activity and broader bullish pressure. Then comes Fartcoin—a name few took seriously until now. Posting an eye-popping 23.5% daily gain, it’s suddenly all over crypto Reddit and Telegram trading chats. While the fundamentals may be light, the market doesn’t care. The meme economy is running on vibes and volatility. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins , What Happened to Pudgy Penguins? Interestingly, while most meme coins are climbing, Pudgy Penguins has pulled back by 8.4% in the last 24 hours. However, this dip comes after a jaw-dropping 217.3% gain in the last 30 days. Even with this recent correction, it remains one of the top-performing meme assets over the past month, beating out Bonk’s 161% and FLOKI’s 74.6%. Bullish Macro Sentiment and the Altcoin Revival The crypto market as a whole is heating up fast. Bitcoin recently touched $123K , gaining 6.8% over the past week. Ethereum surged by nearly 25%, while XRP exploded by 32.9%. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin also saw significant gains, with Cardano leading that pack with a 29.5% rise. This isn’t just another temporary pump it looks and feels like the beginning of a real altseason. The Fear and Greed Index hovering around 70–74 shows growing investor confidence. Capital is moving away from Bitcoin dominance and pouring into altcoins and high-risk, high-reward meme tokens. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Their surge is tied to a combination of bullish crypto market sentiment, the rise of altseason, and regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act. FLOKI and Bonk, in particular, have seen explosive volume spikes and strong community support. Is this the start of altcoin season? It certainly looks like it. Bitcoin dominance is slipping, and altcoins—including meme coins—are outperforming.

2025-07-17T12:06:39,"XRP Price Prediction 17 July, 2025: Is Ripple Price Going to $4 Today After Launch of UXRP ETF?","XRP (XRP) has gone up by 11% in the past 24 hours and has broken through the $3 barrier, which favors a bullish XRP price prediction . This rally seems to have been ignited by the approval of the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) linked to this token in the United States. We’re excited to introduce ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) and ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP). These new funds target 2x the daily returns of Solana and XRP, respectively. Learn more about our crypto-linked ETFs: https://t.co/ivXmFp8gMJ These funds invest in cryptocurrency… pic.twitter.com/m28zvnukkF — ProShares (@ProShares) July 15, 2025 The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) will hit the trading floor today once the American session opens. This vehicle provides leveraged exposure to the native asset of the Ripple network. It will seek to produce two times the daily performance of XRP. It will achieve this by investing in derivatives like futures and options. Although a spot ETF has not been approved for XRP yet, this marks a pivotal moment for this blockchain project after years of facing regulatory and legal issues, including a long-standing lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP has now delivered a 57.2% gain since the year started and has broken out of its consolidation. The token stands just 15% away from its January 18 all-time high of $3.84. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes $3.77 as First Stop After Breakout Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have nearly doubled after XRP broke the $3 threshold as it has potentially triggered a short-squeeze. Data from CoinGlass indicates that $360 million worth of short positions have been blown up in the past 24 hours. Around 7% of that total corresponds to XRP while Ethereum shorts suffered the strongest liquidations as the top altcoin reached $3,450. By using the height of the consolidation pattern seen in the daily chart we could estimate the magnitude of XRP’s next leg up. As a result, a 38% gain could be expected, meaning a baseline XRP price prediction of $3.77 per token for the next few days if bullish momentum continues to gain traction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already entered overbought territory. This increases the risk of a pullback but also favors a bullish outlook as it means that the uptrend is quite strong. Significant liquidity lies above the $3.4 level – the token’s local high – and we could expect a big explosive move once XRP hits that threshold as market participants will aim to fill the high volume of orders that sit at that level. As top cryptos continue their relentless rally, the best crypto presales are poised to deliver the highest returns as investors are hunting for assets that can deliver 10X gains. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises More Than $3M to Unlock the Untapped Potential of BTCFi Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has raised more than $3 million through its crypto presale already to launch its Solana-based side chain. This project will allow BTC holders to stake, earn yield, and lend their tokens safely and without leaving the security of the Bitcoin network. Through a Solana-powered bridge, BTC tokens will be sent to a canonical Bitcoin wallet address and will be automatically minted in the Bitcoin Hyper L2 to access its DeFi ecosystem. Once this solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for its utility token, $HYPER, will skyrocket. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-07-17T12:01:09,"According to Blockchain Analysis Firm CryptoQuant, Short-Term Investors Are Waiting for These Levels to Sell! Here Are the Details","Blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant announced that Bitcoin held by short-term investors has not yet reached the levels necessary for a major profit-taking wave. CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Upside Potential of Up to 25% Still on the Table According to the company's analysis, the STH MVRV ratio is currently just 1.15, well below the 1.35 threshold that typically sees strong profit realization. What is STH MVRV? Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is an indicator used to measure the level of unrealized profits made by short-term investors. It is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's market capitalization by the average purchase price (realized price) of short-term investors. According to CryptoQuant's analysis: The STH realized price surpassed $100,000 for the first time on July 11 and is currently above $102,000. This historical turning point shows that investors entered at higher prices and still have not moved into a strong profit area. An MVRV ratio of 1.35 historically indicates 35% unrealized profit, and whenever this threshold is crossed, the market experiences short-term corrections. Up to 25% Upside Potential The current MVRV ratio of 1.15 suggests there is still 20% to 25% upside room for Bitcoin compared to the historical threshold of 1.35. This could signal a new bull run window for investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-17T12:00:43,"Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins","The post Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, recently hit a new record above $123,000 , only to pull back below $118,000 as profit-taking kicked in. Despite all, on-chain signals hint at more upside ahead, as a key metric used by analysts shows that short-term holders have not yet reached the usual profit levels that trigger heavy selling. Does this mean Bitcoin still has room left for a bigger rally? Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over According to data shared by CryptoQuant author Darkfost , the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) ratio remains well below its critical threshold. This indicator measures unrealized profits for short-term Bitcoin holders and often signals when profit-taking could start. In the past cylce, when the STH MVRV reached about 1.35, meaning holders had roughly 35% unrealized profits, Bitcoin usually faced short-term corrections as investors start taking profits. This usually leads to short-term corrections in price. Looking at the current cycle, Darkfost notes that STH unrealized gains have never crossed the 42% mark, meaning the market hasn’t reached an extreme greed zone yet. Right now, the STH MVRV stands near 1.15, signaling that holders are sitting on about 15% gains, far from the levels that typically spark heavy selling. STH MVRV Signals More Upside Ahead for BTC “Every time the STH MVRV has reached around 1.35, it has triggered profit-taking behavior… There is still room for BTC to rise by approximately 20% to 25% before hitting that critical MVRV threshold again.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/HPNehg5EJ8 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 17, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Strategy Hits $128.5B Valuation with 601,550 BTC , Why This Matters for Bitcoin’s Price What’s even more interesting is that the realized price for short-term holders just crossed $100,000 on July 11 for the first time ever. Today, it’s already above $102,000, setting a new benchmark in Bitcoin’s history. This shift raises the threshold for profit-taking even further, creating more breathing room for the current rally. How High Can Bitcoin Price Go? Based on past trends, Bitcoin still has room to climb by 20% to 25% before hitting the profit-taking zone near an MVRV level of 1.35. This means the market could experience another strong upward move before large-scale selling begins. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $118,000. If it gains 20%, the price could reach about $141,600. Meanwhile, if the bitcoin see a 25% rise would push it close to $147,500. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-17T12:00:25,"Derivative trading growth led to Q2 24% prices resurgence, CoinGecko","The crypto market surged by 24% on average in Q2, erasing some of the losses of the previous quarter. The second quarter erased the rough start to 2025, while also leading to a shift in the profile of crypto traders. The crypto market added 24% on average in Q2, returning most crypto prices to highs not seen since January. Based on Coingecko data , Q2 showed gradual growth, while deeper trading trends shifted among market participant profiles. The market recovered $663.6B in lost value, ending the quarter with a market cap of $3.5T, just shy of the levels in January. New capital flowed into BTC, leading to a dominance above 62% for most of Q2. However, spot volumes lagged behind derivatives. BTC ended the quarter with 29.9% net returns, while ETH locked in 36.5%, but failed to cause an altcoin rally. The Q2 report by Coingecko showed a major theme of influence shifting to institutions . Spot trading also gave way to derivative activity, betting on price action even without holding actual coins or tokens. Q2 set the pace for the new series of records in July, as the crypto market remained lively despite geopolitical tensions and uncertainty. Trading in Q2 shifted to DEX and derivative exchanges Spot trading slowed down for the second quarter, despite a series of BTC records. Decentralized exchanges saw peak growth for both spot swaps and perpetual futures volumes. Hyperliquid emerged as the clear winner in the derivative category, while PancakeSwap enjoyed peak activity based on Binance’s campaigns and token launches. Centralized exchanges saw an outflow of volumes and users, signaling a broader shift in crypto usage. In June, the DEX share peaked at close to 30% of centralized volumes, showing decentralized markets are much more than a byline. With more stringent requirements on centralized markets, DEXs remain a source of no-KYC trading and a venue for newly launched tokens. Despite the market optimism, centralized exchanges lost more than 27% of their volumes from Q1, achieving $3.9T in total volumes for Q2. Binance still dominated the spot market, with a share of 37%-39% throughout the quarter. MEXC, HTX and Bitget increased their volumes, boosted by meme listings. Crypto.com lost the most activity, with volumes falling by 61.4% for the past quarter. After locking in the second spot for two consecutive quarters, Crypto.com fell to eighth position based on spot volumes. Circle opened IPO season in Q2 Some of the Q2 trends may set the pace for the rest of the year. One of the big trends remained the expansion of treasury companies , using the traditional market to raise funds and buy crypto. The surprise trend was crypto companies gaining market valuation through an IPO. Circle’s IPO exceeded expectations during the quarter, boosting excitement for crypto companies. The Circle IPO in June was 25 times oversubscribed and rallied on the first day of the trading launch. Despite the $31 per share price, the shares immediately rallied and closed at $83.23. Circle’s IPO may set the pace for the next quarter, when IPO are expected from Kraken, Gemini, and Grayscale. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-17T12:00:13,"Crypto Week In Jeopardy: Legislative Hurdles Threaten Progress On Regulation Bills","The future of three critical crypto bills faced uncertainty late Wednesday as conservative House Republicans united to oppose the legislation, bringing the process to a standstill. According to CNBC information, fresh opposition emerged from a new faction of Republicans who resisted “last-minute changes” aimed at appeasing earlier holdouts, complicating negotiations that are ongoing. House GOP Divisions As of late Wednesday, more than half a dozen Republicans reportedly joined Democrats in voting against allowing two of the regulation bills to advance in their current forms. This impasse has raised concerns about the ability of House Republicans to reconcile their differing views on crypto regulation, even though the bills generally enjoy broad support. House Speaker Mike Johnson from Louisiana can afford to lose only a few Republican votes to pass the measures through a party-line vote, making the current stalemate particularly precarious. The situation also casts doubt on President Donald Trump’s influence within the party. After a meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday evening with a group of conservative Republicans, Trump announced that they had reached an agreement to support the rules necessary for moving forward. However, Wednesday’s developments signify a setback for the crypto industry, which had hoped for legislative progress during what had been dubbed “Crypto Week.” Alternative Strategies For Crypto Legislation Opposition on Wednesday came not only from conservative hardliners but also from members of key committees involved in drafting the legislation. Among the bills at stake is the GENIUS Act, which successfully passed the Senate in June, alongside the CLARITY Act and another bill restricting the Federal Reserve from establishing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). As negotiations continue, Republican leadership is reportedly contemplating alternative strategies, including adding the central bank digital currency ban to an unrelated must-pass bill, a move reported by Punchbowl. Market journalist Eleanor Terret noted on social media that Senate Republicans are hoping for some progress from the House to maintain momentum for crypto legislation, although they want to avoid another failed vote. Some of the Republicans who initially opposed the bills but later shifted their stance after meeting with Trump did so on the condition that strong anti-central bank digital currency provisions would be integrated into the CLARITY Act, as the GENIUS Act is not open for amendments. However, the authors of CLARITY, along with several other committee members, have expressed concerns that combining these two initiatives could jeopardize the bipartisan market structure legislation they have worked on for months. One Republican holdout, Representative Chip Roy, expressed skepticism about the agreements made previously, suggesting that the consensus reached in the White House meeting may no longer hold. In light of the evolving situation, GOP leaders are now pushing to incorporate anti-CBDC language into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as another potential pathway for advancing the legislation.

2025-07-17T12:00:02,"Top Crypto Analyst Confirms Altcoin Season: ‘It Starts Now’","Renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz has declared what many crypto traders have long been waiting for: Altcoin Season has officially begun. In a market breakdown released on July 16, Olszewicz dismissed any lingering doubt about the current market structure, arguing that the conditions for outsized altcoin performance are firmly in place. Crypto Alert: Altcoin Season Is Here “For years, you’ve had people telling you, ‘It’s an alt season.’ The funny thing is, when alt season is actually here, you don’t need anybody to tell you—it’s obvious,” Olszewicz said, emphasizing that current price action across major alts and risk assets leaves little room for ambiguity.

He acknowledged that BTC’s strength underpins the entire market cycle, but the focus has shifted to the explosive moves underway in altcoins. “Let’s be honest—you’re here because you want to outperform BTC by 2x to 5x. That’s the goal,” he said. Ethereum sits at the center of this rotation, breaking out decisively from $2,200 to above $3,200. “ETH has had quite the breakout. It’s above the next pivot at $3,200. I don’t need the cloud to tell me this is bullish,” Olszewicz noted, pointing to technical tailwinds and regulatory clarity surrounding staking and ETFs as additional catalysts. While ETH advocates have renewed confidence, Olszewicz cautioned against overconfidence: “Be careful drinking the Kool-Aid. ETH could go to $10K, but I think it’ll struggle at $5K. For July, $4K looks realistic—but that’s already nearly 4x from the April bottom.” The analyst also flagged Solana as a key player for those who missed the early moves in BTC and ETH. “Sol is starting to look better and better here, approaching the yearly pivot. If it breaks above $177, watch out,” he said, although he warned that the SOL/ETH chart still shows weakness. Other strong setups include Sui, Avalanche, and meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, which have already logged triple-digit percentage gains in recent weeks from their respective bottom. Still, Olszewicz urged traders to temper expectations for an uninterrupted melt-up. Historically, August and September have been weaker months for crypto, and he anticipates potential sharp corrections in alts. “Maybe we don’t see huge continuation in those months. We could even get negative 25% days on alts—just randomly, for whatever reason. You know that’s coming,” he said.

Everything looks good. If you’re in positions that aren’t working here, you need to ask yourself why,” Olszewicz added. He highlighted that even NFTs, long considered a proxy for speculative appetite, are surging again, with collections like Pudgy Penguins and Bored Apes seeing multi-week highs. As for the much-debated ETH/BTC pair, Olszewicz reminded traders that relative value matters. “This is why everyone came here—for this chart. We’re still far below the cloud, at levels last seen in 2020. The target for mean reversion is 0.038. Until ETH/BTC is above the weekly cloud, don’t get carried away with the ETH-maxi stuff,” he said, adding that the long-term bear trend could persist into 2026 despite short-term strength. Olszewicz closed with a note of caution for overleveraged traders. “This is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t lose your shirt on 50x leverage when there’s so much market left to trade,” he warned. With total altcoin market capitalization approaching critical resistance near $1.5 trillion and sentiment flashing risk-on across the board, the message from one of crypto’s most followed analysts is clear: Altcoin Season isn’t coming—it’s already here. At press time, the total crypto market cap surged to 3.75 trillion.
