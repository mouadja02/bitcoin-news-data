2025-07-17T16:55:27,"Citigroup Looking To Issue Own Stablecoin and Offer Crypto Asset Custody Solutions, Says CEO Jane Fraser","The third-largest bank in the US is signaling intentions to enhance its digital asset capabilities and offerings. In an earnings call for the second quarter of 2025, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser says stablecoins are the ‚Äúnext evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing and liquidity.‚Äù According to Fraser, the trillion-dollar bank intends to, among other things, issue a stablecoin and offer custody services for crypto assets. ‚ÄúSo four main areas that we‚Äôre exploring [are] reserve management for stablecoins, the on and off ramps from cash and coin, backwards and forwards. We are looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin. But probably most importantly is the tokenized deposit space where we‚Äôre very active. And then also providing custodial solutions for crypto assets. So this is a good opportunity for us.‚Äù According to the Citigroup CEO, the third-largest US bank‚Äôs potential stablecoin will have a cost advantage when used for making payments. ‚ÄúSo if you keep in mind right now, stablecoins about 88% of all stablecoin transactions are used to settle crypto trades. There‚Äôs only 6% which is payments. In a traditional offering, if you are moving from cash to stablecoin and back to cash, right now, you‚Äôre incurring as much as a 7% transaction cost. I mean, that‚Äôs just prohibitive. So this is where Citi Token Services is so exciting because it enables the client to move from physical fiat to the digital and back again without incurring that transaction cost.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-17T16:24:58,"RGB protocol goes live on Bitcoin unlocking native support for stablecoins","RGB protocol, a smart contract and asset issuance protocol for Bitcoin, has officially launched on the Bitcoin mainnet. On July 17, RGB protocol announced that it had been successfully deployed on Bitcoin, unlocking new functionalities such as token creation, asset transfers, and programmable contracts within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network ecosystems. The latest release, version 0.11.1, marks a major milestone for developers and users that want to issue and manage digital assets on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network without relying on external blockchains. According to the project team, RGB enables users to create and manage stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), community tokens, and other digital assets directly on Bitcoin. Users can send and receive these assets over Bitcoin or Lightning, all while keeping control, privacy, and decentralization intact. RGB uses client-side validation, meaning all asset data stays off-chain and doesn‚Äôt touch Bitcoin‚Äôs core consensus. This approach helps scale asset issuance on Bitcoin without compromising user privacy. However, asset proofs still get anchored to Bitcoin transactions, keeping them permanent without putting extra load on the blockchain itself. The protocol does not depend on trusted intermediaries such as federations, validators, or centralized coordinators. All validation is done locally by the user, reducing reliance on third parties and minimizing network-level risks. RGB has been positioned as a Bitcoin-native alternative to asset issuance platforms built on other chains, the project‚Äôs team told crypto media. USDT to be launched on Bitcoin As part of its early adoption plans, RGB will support the deployment of Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin on the Bitcoin network. Viktor Ihnatiuk, founder of Boosty Labs, one of the core development firms behind RGB and a founding member of the RGB Protocol Association, confirmed that USDT will serve as the first real-world use case of RGB‚Äôs confidential and scalable asset transfers. Once USDT is launched through RGB, users will be able to send and receive the stablecoin over the Lightning Network with low fees and fast confirmation times. Ihnatiuk said this would remove the need for using separate blockchains that often involve trade-offs in trust and decentralization. Ihnatiuk also noted that several existing RGB-based projects are preparing to integrate Tether once the asset becomes available on the protocol. Further, he added that RGB‚Äôs infrastructure supports Lightning-based atomic swaps, allowing for decentralized trading between different assets without any intermediaries. On top of that, the RGB protocol includes a virtual machine that developers can use to build DeFi applications and smart contract logic similar to what is available on Ethereum or Solana. This means, like Ethereum, developers would be able to create decentralized applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem, leveraging its security while expanding functionality. To support ongoing development and adoption, a group of industry stakeholders has established the RGB Protocol Association. It plans to drive development, support education, and back community projects with grants and sponsorships. The association‚Äôs founding members include Bitfinex, Boosty Labs, Fulgur Ventures, Plan B Network, Kaleidoswap, ThunderStack, LNFI, Bitmask (by Diba), and Tribe RGB. RGB‚Äôs launch is part of a growing push to expand what Bitcoin can do. Other initiatives in this regard include, Bitcoin ordinals , which allows users to inscribe NFTs directly onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin.

2025-07-17T16:09:50,"Bitcoin DeFi TVL Surges from $307 Million to $6.4 Billion in Just 18 Months","Bitcoin decentralized finance ( DeFi ) has seen a massive 1,971.7% rise in total value locked (TVL) over just a year and a half, according to the latest report by Arch Network . Per the report, Bitcoin DeFi has recorded a massive TVL surge over an 18-month period between January 2024 and July 2025. More precisely, it increased from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.5 billion by December 2024. It then settled at $6.36 billion as of early July 2025. At the time of writing, TVL stands at $7.049 billion. This would mark a whopping 2,196% rise since the December 2024 amount. Source: DeFiLlama The report noted that the surge was fueled by several key factors. These include protocol launches, novel token standards, growing institutional inflows, a rally pushing BTC to an all-time high, and the rise of liquid restaking. Moreover, Ethereum has been the undisputed DeFi leader for years now, thanks to smart contracts and a strong developer ecosystem. Yet, ‚Äúthe narrative is evolving,‚Äù Arch Network claims. ‚ÄúA new wave of builders is bringing DeFi to Bitcoin.‚Äù These developers are attracted by Bitcoin‚Äôs security, untapped liquidity, institutional interest, and increasing user demand for composable financial tools. Furthermore, Layer 1 innovations and protocols are unlocking Bitcoin‚Äôs native programmability. ‚ÄúMany view Bitcoin as the next DeFi frontier, set to even outpace Ethereum,‚Äù it claims. ‚ÄúAs this momentum grows, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a foundational layer for DeFi is becoming increasingly undeniable.‚Äù According to Arch Network CEO and co-founder, Matt Mudano, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs true potential lies beyond being a passive store of value. As a $2 trillion asset, unlocking its liquidity to build a truly open and permissionless financial system on its base layer is the next frontier. Bitcoin DeFi is the greatest opportunity not only for crypto, but for financial innovation as a whole.‚Äù You may also like: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch, on Bitcoin Momentum, Programmability on Bitcoin, and the Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Ep. 443 Curve DAO‚Äôs native token $CRV rebounded this week, with about a 79% rally as it climbed from a weekly low of $0.6017 and is trading at $0.9882 at press time, also marking a 22.9% increase in the last 24 hours.Despite occasional profit‚Äëtaking around mid‚Äëweek, $CRV‚Äôs renewed momentum indicates robust buying interest ahead of key governance votes and protocol upgrades.On-chain analytics show $CRV trading volume has surged to $848.37‚ÄØmillion in the last 24‚ÄØhours, indicating heightened... 36% of Respondents Keep BTC in Cold Storage, Favoring Self-Custody Over Yield and Bitcoin DeFi Among many findings in the report, Arch noted that 36% of respondents hold BTC in cold storage. 33% trade on CEXs, and 31% use it for payments. Also, 29% use BTC as DeFi collateral, 22% for bridging, 20% in Bitcoin-native DeFi, and 28% as liquidity provision. 7% aren‚Äôt actively using their coins. Moreover, among those who don‚Äôt use BTC in DeFi, 36% cited lack of trust, and 25% said risk and fear of loss. Other reasons include technical barriers (poor tooling and low liquidity), UX, and regulation. Also, 16% simply prefer to HODL. The same amount waits for better infrastructure. ‚ÄúOnly 11% don‚Äôt see clear benefits, suggesting that most concerns can be addressed rather than indicating a lack of interest in leveraging Bitcoin more actively,‚Äù the report argues. Meanwhile, among those who use Bitcoin DeFi, there are both veterans and newcomers, the researchers found. The majority of respondents are in Asia (61%) and Africa (17%). Source: Arch Network 55% of respondents are involved in lending and borrowing protocols, while 51% are in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and 40% in stablecoins. Most builders (44%) chose Bitcoin DeFi for its security and decentralization, and 27% are in it for growing liquidity and ecosystem expansion. Other reasons include Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term vision and community (26%), the opportunity for Layer 2 innovation (20%), ecosystem growth (17%), censorship resistance (12%), and privacy (8%). However, despite its advantages, Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt built for complex smart contracts, the report notes. For 43% of the respondents, this is the main challenge. Lack of developer tools (22), poor documentation (15%), low composability (16%), and liquidity (12%) are other reasons. These show ‚Äúthat Bitcoin DeFi is still early.‚Äù As solutions to many of these issues, respondents named better infrastructure (45%) and broader L2 adoption (43%). Many developers also work on Ethereum (63%), Solana (47%), and Base (44%), with 60% preferring other chains for smart contract flexibility and 33% for developer tools. That said, 49% of responding developers working on other chains plan to switch fully to Bitcoin. 39% will stay multichain, and 12% haven‚Äôt decided yet.

In an explosive twist no one saw coming, Bonk.fun, also known as LetsBonkFun, just dethroned Ethereum-based launchpads in 24-hour revenue, sending shockwaves through the memecoin world. The platform not only outpaced Solana-based competitors but also pulled ahead of Ethereum itself, a staggering feat that has traders scrambling. But it‚Äôs not just Bonk.fun that‚Äôs ripping, $SNORT, the cheeky crypto aardvark token born on the platform, is riding this momentum with a jaw-dropping surge in volume and price. With memecoin energy back at full blast and degen capital flooding into launchpads, the question isn‚Äôt just who‚Äôs next ‚Äì it‚Äôs how far can this madness go? That‚Äôs just for a day. But for the week, bonk.fun beat out pump.fun and Raydium among launchpads. It also casually bested Solana‚Äôs weekly revenue ($8.25M to $967K). The moves sent ripples through $BONK‚Äôs market performance, boosting the impact of meme coin launchpads while also sending $BONK skywards. As letsbonk.fun surges and $BONK climbs, other meme coin projects look ready to rock. Record-Breaking Revenue & Market Dominance According to SolanaFloor, letsbonk.fun outstripped Ethereum‚Äôs 24-hour revenue, a milestone validated by DefiLlama figures showing revenues of $1.04M, nearly double Pump.fun‚Äôs $533K.. Over the week of July 7‚Äì13, bonk.fun earned roughly $8.19‚ÄØM, compared to Pump.fun‚Äôs $3.1‚ÄØM. Livestream data reveals that 19,000 memecoins were launched in 24 hours via letsbonk.fun vs 9,200 via pump.fun, capturing 58% market share. Bonk.fun appears to be amplifying momentum, not just riding an existing meme coin wave. 50% of launchpad fees are directed toward BONK buybacks, reinforcing demand and supporting token value. $BONK has accordingly surged 70% since April, trading around $0.000037. Bonk.fun, Powered by Solana Bonk.fun is benefiting from a rejuvenated Solana ecosystem. Solana launchpads raised $52.6M in revenue in the past 30 days, while $SOL itself trades at $174, up 12% in the past week. Yet with high velocity comes high risk. Many meme coins launched via these platforms collapse mere days post-launch. Others surge 1000s of percent before falling back to earth. That‚Äôs in part because of the frenetic nature of Solana meme coin trading and the broader meme coin sector. But that crazy energy is part of what makes memes so potentially profitable and also explains why the sector is up in recent days. Part of that increase is due to pump.fun, the former king of Solana meme coins, and the long-awaited $PUMP token launch. $PUMP briefly crested $2B market cap, before its price fell 14% to a $1.85B market cap. In the meantime, $BONK is up 2.6% daily ‚Äì and a whopping 56% over the past week. So which meme tokens are next to go to the moon?

Companies are announcing multi-million dollar moves one after another, with the latest announcement coming from Bit Origin. Nasdaq-listed company Bit Origin has announced that it will raise $500 million and create a large treasury of Dogecoin (DOGE). According to the official statement, Bit Origin announced that it plans to raise $500 million, including $400 million in equity and $100 million in convertible debt, to accumulate Dogecoin as a core asset. The company has already raised $15 million and plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds for its first Dogecoin purchase.

2025-07-17T16:05:00,"Tether‚Äôs $3 Billion USDT Mint Raises Questions Amid Stablecoin Law Passage","Tether, a major player in the crypto space, has created $3 billion worth of popular stablecoin USDT within a single day. This significant and sudden increase in supply comes at a time when the United States is moving closer to introducing new rules for stablecoins. These rules, under the proposed GENIUS Act, may change how stablecoins operate in the country. As a result, market attention could shift toward regulated alternatives such as Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD. Tether Increases Supply As GENIUS Act Sets New Standards Blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain revealed that Tether minted another $1 billion worth of USDT. This brings the total stablecoin minted on July 17 to $3 billion. Market experts suggest that this move aims to boost liquidity and support the recent price movements of Bitcoin (BTC). This move comes shortly after the GENIUS Act passed a procedural vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed law seeks to set federal standards to ensure stability and transparency in the market. If signed into law, the bill would require stablecoin issuers to follow strict federal guidelines. Crypto firms will be required to hold only cash or secure, short-term assets and secure formal licenses to operate. They must also publish financial records that have been independently audited. Tether May Face Regulatory Pressure Under New U.S. Law These proposed rules could pose a significant challenge for Tether, which currently controls over 66% of the global stablecoin market. Unlike complete audits, Tether only provides attestations, and its reserves include Bitcoin and precious metals. Meanwhile, in the past, the company has been criticized for its unclear reserve practices . Under the GENIUS Act, this might not be enough to continue operating legally in the U.S. On the bright side, the law does offer some breathing room. The Senate version gives a three-year grace period, while the House version offers 18 months. This gives Tether time to either adjust its reserve structure or consider launching a new, U.S.-compliant version of its stablecoin. Ripple and Circle May Gain from New Regulation Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD , appears ready to follow the new rules. Ripple has applied for a national trust bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account. It also announced that BNY Mellon will serve as the official custodian of RLUSD reserves, which the U.S. Treasury backs. These steps show that RLUSD is designed to meet the legal requirements outlined in the GENIUS Act. If the act becomes law, RLUSD may be among the first stablecoins entirely accepted under U.S. regulation. This may lead to a large shift of funds away from USDT and into compliant alternatives. Circle, the company behind USDC, is another possible beneficiary. Following news of the bill‚Äôs progress, Circle‚Äôs stock rose by 34%, reflecting investor confidence in stablecoins that adhere to government regulations.

2025-07-17T16:00:22,"Altcoins Reclaim Key Technical Level ‚Äì Can Momentum Sustain This Time?","Altcoins are flashing fresh bullish signals as momentum returns to the broader crypto market. Leading the charge is Ethereum, which has surged above the $3,450 level, marking its highest price since mid-January. The breakout signals growing confidence among bulls and is sparking renewed interest across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds ‚Äì $0‚Äì$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Many altcoins have posted impressive gains in recent days, bouncing sharply from their April lows. The recovery is not just isolated to top names like ETH and SOL; mid- and small-cap tokens are also showing signs of strength, supported by increasing volume and improved market structure. A key technical development is adding weight to the bullish case: the altcoin market has once again pushed above a key daily moving average. This historically significant level often marks the transition from downtrends to sustained uptrends. Altcoins Reclaim 200-Day Moving Average Altcoins are showing renewed strength, and according to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the technical landscape is beginning to shift in their favor. In a recent chart shared on X, he highlighted that the altcoin market has once again broken above its 200-day moving average, a level that historically separates bearish phases from sustained uptrends. However, On-Chain Mind cautioned that this development has occurred multiple times during this market cycle, often followed by weeks of sideways chop and volatility rather than immediate upside. Still, this time may be different. With Ethereum rallying above $3,400‚Äîits highest level since mid-January‚Äîand Bitcoin consolidating above key support zones, conditions appear more favorable for a broader altcoin breakout. What makes this moment particularly important is the price structure across many altcoins, which has turned decisively bullish after months‚Äîand in some cases, years‚Äîof deep consolidation. Tokens across sectors such as DeFi, Layer 1s, and infrastructure are forming higher lows and showing clean breakouts on higher timeframes, indicating growing demand and fresh capital rotation.

This powerful move confirms a breakout above the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages, signaling broad-based strength across the altcoin market. One key technical milestone is the bullish crossover of the 50-week SMA above the 100-week SMA. Meanwhile, the 200-week SMA‚Äînow positioned near $880 billion‚Äîhas acted as strong support during previous corrections and continues to provide a solid foundation for the current uptrend.

If TOTAL2 holds above $1.4 trillion, the next resistance target is the $1.6 trillion level, last tested earlier this year. A sustained move toward that range could confirm the beginning of a long-awaited altseason.

2025-07-17T16:00:11,"Top Trader to XRP Holders: It‚Äôs Time to Prepare for Retirement Pump","In a moment that sent shockwaves through the XRP community, top trader Cobb took to X with a bold proclamation: ‚ÄúWhat the f** is going on holy s*** It‚Äôs time to prepare for the retirement pump.‚Äù His post came as XRP was already trading at $3.1352, having confidently broken past the psychological $3 barrier. As of this report, XRP has continued its upward momentum, climbing to $3.23. Cobb‚Äôs Alert: A Signal, Not Just Emotion Known for his timely insights and sharp market instincts, Cobb‚Äôs message wasn‚Äôt mere hype; it was a calculated signal. The phrase ‚Äúretirement pump‚Äù hints at something deeper than a typical rally: a potential breakout strong enough to reward long-term holders in a transformative way. This surge follows a moment earlier in the year when XRP briefly reclaimed the $3 level before pulling back. The current rally, however, appears far more sustainable, underpinned by improved technical strength and stronger macro fundamentals. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HOLY SHIT ITS ACTUALLY TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE RETIREMENT PUMP pic.twitter.com/cshL3pt3Wz ‚Äî Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 17, 2025 Fueling the Rally: Technicals, Institutions, and On-Chain Growth Several factors are driving XRP‚Äôs bullish momentum. Technically, the token has cleared key resistance zones and is holding above the $3 mark with increasing volume and trader conviction. Whale activity and accumulation have intensified, while total wallet addresses recently soared past 7.19 million, marking an all-time high and indicating growing retail and institutional participation. On the fundamentals side, Ripple‚Äôs ongoing expansion is reinforcing investor confidence. The successful launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, and the operational go-live of Ripple Payments Europe SA in Luxembourg have amplified its global footprint. Meanwhile, the recent launch of the UXRP ETF adds another layer of legitimacy and exposure, opening XRP to traditional markets and institutional capital.

Bitcoin is holding above $118,500, while Ethereum trades at $3,427.50. XRP, with its nearly 10% gain in the last 24 hours, stands out not just for its price movement but for the strength and structure of its breakout. Market analysts now believe that if XRP maintains support above the $3.10‚Äì$3.20 range, the next leg up toward $3.50‚Äì$3.60 is well within reach . Some are even projecting a run toward the $4 mark, should institutional demand and trading volume continue to build. The Retirement Pump May Be Real Cobb‚Äôs call may have captured the raw emotion of the moment, but the data backs it up. XRP is not just pumping; it‚Äôs showing signs of a sustained breakout, supported by legal clarity, growing adoption, and expanding infrastructure. For long-time holders and new entrants alike, this could be a defining moment. Whether or not this truly is the ‚Äúretirement pump,‚Äù one thing is clear: XRP is finally moving with force, and the market is watching.
