2025-07-17T03:48:20,"Trump-Linked World Liberty Tokens Set to Trade, May Inflate President‚Äôs Digital Asset Wealth","World Liberty Financial‚Äôs crypto token, WLFI, is set to become tradable following a landslide community vote that could significantly boost President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto fortune. On Wednesday, token holders overwhelmingly approved a proposal to unlock WLFI for trading, with 99.94% voting in favor. The move marks a turning point for the Trump-linked project, which was launched last year as a decentralized finance platform offering both a governance token and a stablecoin. The proposal, first introduced on July 9, outlined plans to transition World Liberty from a closed ecosystem to one with broader market participation. Big news from the WLFI community The community has officially voted ‚Äî and the results were overwhelming. $WLFI will be tradable The people have spoken Now it‚Äôs time to execute. Standby for the full launch plan ‚Äî coming soon. ‚Äî WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) July 16, 2025 Trading Begins for Early World Liberty Financial Holders, Full Unlock Still Pending ‚ÄúThis would mark a major milestone in the development of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem,‚Äù the team wrote. It added that this would open the door for wider community access and protocol development. WLFI tokens were initially sold in two tranches, priced at $0.015 and $0.05. However, buyers were not allowed to trade them at the time. Instead, they received voting rights on protocol decisions and access to Trump-related events. For instance, in May, top TRUMP memecoin holders were invited to a gala dinner with the president. Among the guests was Tron founder Justin Sun . With trading enabled, price discovery and speculation will now begin. Although only early investor tokens will be unlocked initially, a second vote will determine when the remaining supply of the 100b WLFI tokens can be released. Trump‚Äôs Inner Circle Anchors World Liberty‚Äôs Leadership and Ownership The team noted that founder, advisor and team allocations will follow a longer vesting schedule. This is meant to signal long-term alignment with the project‚Äôs success. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs three sons serve as official advisors to World Liberty. They are joined by real estate executive and longtime Trump ally Steve Witkoff, who now serves as the US special envoy to the Middle East. Additionally, Witkoff‚Äôs sons, Zach and Alex, are co-founders of the project. A company linked to Trump, DT Marks DEFI LLC, is expected to receive 22.5b WLFI tokens. Additionally, Trump personally held 15.75b WLFI as of the end of last year. According to Bloomberg, the Trump family has earned roughly $390m from WLFI sales, contributing to a total $620m in crypto-linked wealth . Lawmakers Question Conflicts as Trump Crypto Profits Soar Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns over Trump‚Äôs growing involvement in crypto. This includes his ventures in Bitcoin mining and stablecoin development. As a result, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have called on the US SEC to investigate possible conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, the White House has stated that Trump‚Äôs assets are held in a trust managed by his children and has denied any conflict of interest. However, the terms of this trust have not been disclosed. Importantly, Trump remains the sole beneficiary. This means he could access proceeds from crypto ventures at any time or once he leaves office. Despite the controversy, supporters see WLFI‚Äôs trading debut as a financial opportunity and a show of political loyalty. ‚ÄúWe invested to get rich,‚Äù one holder posted on the project website. Another simply wrote, ‚ÄúTo make America great again.‚Äù Most token holders remain anonymous, shielded behind crypto wallet addresses.

2025-07-17T03:00:34,"Bitcoin Recovers to $119K But Key Indicators Show Mixed Signals","Bitcoin has begun to recover after a brief decline triggered by the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. On July 15, the asset dropped to a low of $116,000 in response to news that inflation rose to 2.7% in June, amid continued concerns over tariffs from the Trump administration. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,439, reflecting a 1.8% gain over the past 24 hours, which suggests that some investor confidence has returned to the market despite recent volatility. This short-term rebound occurs amid increasing on-chain and market activity, which analysts are closely tracking. One such contributor, Trader Oasis, recently published an analysis on CryptoQuant outlining various indicators tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs current movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame? Bitcoin Open Interest, Price Divergence, and Institutional Signals The analyst explored a range of technical and behavioral metrics, including open interest, Coinbase premium index, and funding rates, that are influencing BTC‚Äôs recent price behavior and hinting at what may lie ahead. Trader Oasis began by noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs breach of the $107,000 resistance signaled the beginning of a potential distribution phase. He pointed out that a divergence between price and open interest acted as a preliminary bullish signal, preceding the asset‚Äôs climb. The current state, where both price and open interest are rising in tandem, is seen by some as a sign of strengthening momentum in the market. He also evaluated data from the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero, typically seen as an indication of institutional demand. However, Oasis observed that the indicator‚Äôs flat behavior, even as price rises, could imply large entities are securing profits. He further suggested that a breakout above the descending trend line could trigger a stronger upward move, but a fall below zero might represent a new entry signal. Regarding funding rates, he noted that the current rise reflects renewed market confidence, although it is still below previous extreme levels. This, in his view, implies that while enthusiasm exists, excessive leverage is not yet present. Profit-Taking Rises as Binance Dominates Realized Flows A separate analysis by another CryptoQuant contributor, Crazzyblockk, looked at the realized profit and loss (PnL) across centralized exchanges. According to the data, Bitcoin investors realized $9.29 billion in profits in a single day, marking a record high for such flows. This surge in realized PnL reflects widespread profit-taking in the wake of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rally, especially among short-term holders. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Moves $1.2B in BTC: Is A Major Sell-Off Coming? On Binance specifically, the realized PnL remains below its all-time highs but has seen a rising share compared to other exchanges. Data shows that on some days, Binance‚Äôs share of realized profits has reached up to 60%, reinforcing its growing importance in shaping market behavior. Crazzyblockk concluded that this concentrated profit-taking, led by Binance users, could indicate a shift in market dynamics, noting: Binance‚Äôs increasing dominance in realized PnL flows reinforces its critical role in market sentiment and liquidity. For traders and analysts, it is crucial to closely monitor Binance‚Äôs on-chain activity alongside other exchanges to stay ahead of potential volatility.
