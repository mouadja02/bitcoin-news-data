With the increasing number of Germans investing in crypto assets, it has become crucial for the government to create a regulatory framework to maintain stability and protect investors. As of 2025, Germany is implementing MiCA rules while tightening AML/CFT compliance. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Germany What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? Crypto Tax in Germany Crypto License in Germany Crypto Adoption in Germany Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Germany June 25, 2025: The German Financial regulator, BaFin , orders the winding up of Ethena GmbH’s operations related to USDe stablecoins in Germany. Holders can change their tokens until August 6, 2025, as BaFin appointed a special representative to oversee the redemption process. March 6, 2025: The Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) publishes an updated circular on the income tax treatment of crypto assets. Key changes: The term “virtual currencies and other tokens” is replaced with “crypto assets.” Differentiation between active and passive staking for tax purposes. Tax implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) are addressed for the first time. New requirements for transaction overviews and tax reporting. Clearer guidelines for valuing crypto assets, including the use of daily market rates. Emphasis on documentation and retention obligations for taxpayers. Transitional rules apply for tax years up to and including 2024 to help taxpayers adapt to the new provisions. February 18, 2025: Legal analysis highlights the impact of the new Act on the Digitalisation of the Financial Market (Finanzmarktdigitalisierungsgesetz, FinmadiG) and the Act on the Supervision of Markets for Crypto-Assets (Kryptomärkte-Aufsichtsgesetz, KMAG). These acts introduce transitional provisions for crypto service providers and allow for a smooth application of MiCAR (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) in Germany. Existing licenses remain valid until December 31, 2025, under a grandfathering regime, giving providers time to transition to MiCAR-compliant licenses Date Regulation/ Law Details June 30, 2024 MiCA regulation Provisions for ARTs and EMTs became applicable May to November 2024 Crypto tax update Short-term and long-term tax, mining, staking, and income tax April 20, 2023 EU parliament adopted MiCA (EU-2023/1114) EU-wide regulations for crypto assets December 16, 2020 Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) Legalized all electronic securities (came into effect in June 2021) January 1, 2020 Exchange and custodian licensing BaFin icesenes required for crypto operations November 2019 Crypto custody law for banks Banks can sell and store crypto as regulated by BaFin November 29, 2019 Implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/843 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? The Free Democratic Party of Germany explicitly called for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the country. However, it is not regulated yet. Besides the federal government, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regulates crypto. BaFin regulates: Licensing and enforcement of AML and CFT rules Blockchain-based lending through the German Banking Act Prohibits any illicit activity in the crypto space Crypto Tax in Germany Capital gains tax: Since cryptocurrencies are not acknowledged as stocks, but rather ‘private economic goods,’ therefore, CGT does not apply . Income tax: The income tax on cryptocurrency ranges from 0% to 45%, depending on the total income. Tax-free event: Gains from crypto trading are exempted from tax up to 1000€ per year. Income from staking and mining is free up to an exemption limit of 256€ per year. Tax reporting: The Last date for the 2024 tax return is July 31, 2025; if the tax return is prepared by tax advisors, the deadline extends to April 30, 2026. Crypto Income in 2025 Tax rate Up to 12.084€ 0% Up to 17.430€ 14-24% Up to 68.430€ 24-42% Up to 277.825€ 42% Over 277.826€ 45% Crypto License in Germany Custody hold: Custody hold requires obtaining a license from BaFin for managing third-party rights and services . CASP license: Crypto assets service providers also require a BaFin-authorized license to operate in Germany. Operating crypto-to-crypto, fiat-to-crypto exchanges, custodial wallet services, and other activities requires licensing. How to get a license? Crypso businesses are required to register with BaFin, establish a local presence in Germany, hold minimum capital (€125,000 to €350,000), and comply with AML and KYC regulations . At least one member of the business must be a resident of the EU. Crypto Adoption in Germany Adoption rate: By 2025, around 27.32 million Germans will use cryptocurrency, representing 32.84% of the population. This indicates an increase in the adoption from previous years. Crypto revenue: The revenue in the crypto market in Germany is projected to reach US$2.5 billion in 2025. An annual growth rate of 16.33% is expected, resulting in US$2.9 billion by 2026. Crypto holdings: The German government sold its entire crypto holdings in mid-2024 (46,359 BTC, approx $3.9 billion), and as of 2025, it does not hold any cryptocurrency. Conclusion Crypto trading and holding are legal in Germany, as the government has provided a set of rules to operate any crypto-related activity. Germany’s main focus for implementing a structured approach is to ensure investors’ protection and financial stability. With its light crypto tax, Germany is considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the European Union. If Germany maintains this stability in the crypto space, it can position itself as the crypto leader in the EU in no time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-17T04:28:38,"XRP Price Fires Up Again: Momentum Grows, Eyes Key Resistance","XRP price started a fresh increase and traded above the $3.020 zone. The price is now consolidating gains and might continue to rise above the $3.10 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $3.020 zone. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.840 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.950 resistance level. The bulls remained in action and the price gained pace for a move above $3.00 barrier. Finally, the price tested the $3.10 zone. A high was formed at $3.10 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the $3.050 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.020 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.050 level. A clear move above the $3.050 resistance might send the price toward the $3.10 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance or even $3.150 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.20 zone. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.950 level and the trend line zone. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The next major support is near the $2.880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.840 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.950 and $2.840.

2025-07-17T04:00:53,"Bitcoin Set To Soar? Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up","Bitcoin (BTC) is currently stabilizing within the $116,000 to $120,000 range. However, fresh liquidity totalling $2 billion in stablecoins could help propel the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs (ATHs). Bitcoin To Benefit From Fresh Liquidity According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, more than $2 billion worth of stablecoins – primarily Tether (USDT) – were deposited into major derivatives trading platforms earlier today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? Taha believes that this surge in inflows signals increased appetite for leveraged positions among seasoned traders, many of whom are anticipating a potential breakout in BTC’s price. Notably, this fresh batch of USDT was minted by Tether Treasury, suggesting institutional demand is driving the activity. Historically, large-scale stablecoin inflows have preceded bullish market momentum, as traders often use them to open long positions on Bitcoin and altcoin futures and perpetual contracts. Rapid stablecoin deposits into derivatives exchanges often act as a leading indicator for major price rallies. Meanwhile, fellow CryptoQuant contributor TraderOasis pointed to rising Open Interest, noting that it is increasing alongside BTC’s price – a classic signal of strong bullish sentiment. To explain, rising open interest in tandem with a rising Bitcoin price typically signals increasing market participation and bullish sentiment, as more traders are opening positions expecting further upside. However, it can also indicate a buildup of leverage, which may lead to heightened volatility or a sharp correction if sentiment shifts. The analyst also highlighted the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero – a sign that US-based buyers are paying a premium over global spot prices. They added that the indicator is currently within a ‘Breaker’ structure, sharing the following chart for context. TraderOasis noted that while BTC price is rising, the Coinbase Premium Index indicator has remained relatively flat. The analyst explained: This suggests to me that major players are taking profits. If the descending trend structure I marked with an arrow is broken, the price is likely to rise much more strongly. On the other hand, if the indicator drops below the ‘0’ level, I may consider it a buying signal, as we are still in a macro bullish market. Short-Term Pullback For BTC? While the $2 billion stablecoin injection is likely to act as a bullish catalyst for BTC and the broader crypto market, some exchange data suggests a potential short-term pullback before the next leg up. Related Reading: No Mania Yet: Bitcoin ATH Lacks Hype, Suggesting Further Upside Potential For instance, BTC deposits to exchanges spiked after the digital asset hit a recent high around $123,000 – a pattern that often precedes local tops and is typically followed by a price correction. That said, despite recent profit-taking, BTC has not experienced a major price drop, pointing to robust underlying demand. At press time, BTC trades at $119,171, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-17T04:00:33,"Bitcoin Devs Propose Sunset For Quantum-Vulnerable Addresses","A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal authored by Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp and five collaborators sets out the most forceful roadmap yet for hardening the network against quantum computing. Titled “Post-Quantum Migration and Legacy Signature Sunset,” the proposal was published on GitHub on 14 July and calls for a phased retirement of all outputs protected by today’s ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. The authors frame the move as a necessary pre-emptive strike: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive — fail to upgrade and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Plan To Secure Bitcoin From Quantum Threat Because every public key that appears on-chain can, in principle, have its corresponding private key recovered by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, the proposal warns that “roughly 25 % of all bitcoin have revealed a public key on-chain; those UTXOs could be stolen with sufficient quantum power.” That slice includes many early P2PK outputs, among them the roughly one million BTC widely believed to be controlled by Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . The authors note that NIST finalised three production-grade post-quantum signature algorithms in 2024 and that academic roadmaps now place a “cryptographically-relevant” quantum computer as early as 2027-2030. At the same time, quantum factoring algorithms “are improving up to 20×,” rapidly shrinking Bitcoin’s safety margin.To neutralise the threat, the draft prescribes a soft-fork sequence tied to the already-proposed P2QRH post-quantum output type (defined in BIP-360): Phase A begins three years after P2QRH goes live and “disallows sending of any funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses,” forcing new coins toward quantum-safe scripts. Phase B follows two years later, on a pre-announced flag day, when “nodes reject transactions that rely on ECDSA/Schnorr keys,” rendering legacy outputs unspendable. Phase C is optional and, pending further research, could enable owners who missed the deadline to recover funds with a zero-knowledge proof of possession of their BIP-39 seed. The document’s rationale is explicit: “A successful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic disruption and damage across the entire ecosystem.” By imposing a known deadline, the authors hope to overcome what they describe as “upgrade inertia” among wallets, exchanges and custodians that historically stretches protocol roll-outs over many years. Each stakeholder cohort is offered a blunt calculus. Miners risk producing “invalid blocks” after Phase B if they do not upgrade, but in the interim can expect heavier blocks and higher fees from the larger post-quantum signatures. Institutional holders face potential fiduciary liability should they ignore the migration timetable, while exchanges confront the prospect of overnight insolvency if quantum attackers drain custodial hot wallets. For individual users, the sunset date converts an abstract, far-off threat into a hard deadline. A notable corollary is that coins abandoned in quantum-vulnerable scripts would become permanently frozen, echoing Satoshi’s early observation that “lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more.” The proposal inverts that logic for quantum-recovered coins, calling them “a theft from everyone.” The BIP remains a draft and has yet to receive a number or taproot-style activation path, but it is already shaping what is likely to become a contentious debate over backward compatibility and the treatment of dormant balances. If adopted, the migration would dwarf SegWit and Taproot in both logistical complexity and monetary stakes, directly affecting an estimated quarter of the 19.7 million BTC in existence. For now, the authors have thrown down a clear gauntlet: either the ecosystem coordinates on a proactive timeline, or it faces the prospect of responding to an emergency only after the first quantum theft has occurred.
