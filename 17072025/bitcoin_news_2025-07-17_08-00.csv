2025-07-17T05:55:13,"U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators","BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators In a significant development for global finance, the major U.S. Stock Markets concluded trading with notable gains, signaling a wave of optimism that could ripple across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of digital currencies. For those keenly observing the ebb and flow of financial landscapes, understanding the drivers behind these traditional market movements is crucial, as they often provide valuable context for anticipating shifts in Cryptocurrency Trends . Today’s positive close is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of growing confidence that could indirectly fuel broader investment appetite. What Drove the Stellar Market Performance ? The past trading session saw all three major U.S. indices climb, showcasing a robust collective performance. This upward trajectory reflects a complex interplay of factors, from positive corporate earnings reports to promising economic data and shifting expectations regarding monetary policy. When these foundational markets exhibit strength, it often suggests underlying economic stability, which can have a cascading effect on investor confidence across the board. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers: Index Closing Change S&P 500 +0.32% Nasdaq Composite +0.10% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.53% The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 large U.S. companies, led the charge, indicating strength in established sectors. The S&P 500, a broader measure of large-cap U.S. equities, also posted solid gains, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a modest but positive increase. This broad-based rally suggests that the positive momentum wasn’t confined to a single sector but was rather a reflection of improving sentiment across the board. How Does This Impact Investor Sentiment ? The closing bell ringing in positive territory for U.S. Stock Markets has a profound effect on Investor Sentiment . When markets are on an upward trend, it fosters a sense of optimism and reduces risk aversion. Investors feel more confident in deploying capital, not just into traditional stocks but potentially into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies as well. This increased confidence can lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment where market participants are more willing to seek higher returns, even if it means taking on more risk. Key aspects of improved investor sentiment include: Increased Confidence: A rising tide lifts all boats, making investors feel more secure about their portfolios and the broader economy. Reduced Fear: Positive market news can quell anxieties about recessions or economic downturns, encouraging sustained investment. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow in value, consumers and investors may feel wealthier, potentially leading to increased spending and further investment. This psychological boost is critical because market movements are not just driven by fundamentals but also by the collective mood of investors. A positive feedback loop can form, where rising prices lead to more optimism, which in turn leads to more buying. What Are These Positive Economic Indicators Signaling? The strong showing in U.S. Stock Markets often reflects underlying positive Economic Indicators . These indicators are crucial pieces of data that provide insights into the health and direction of the economy. A buoyant stock market can be a leading indicator of future economic growth, as it anticipates corporate earnings and overall economic prosperity. Some of the economic signals that might be contributing to this positive market performance include: Inflation Data: Signs of cooling inflation can alleviate pressure on central banks to raise interest rates aggressively, making equities more attractive. Employment Figures: Strong job growth and low unemployment rates indicate a healthy consumer base with spending power. Corporate Earnings: Companies reporting better-than-expected profits can boost stock prices and overall market confidence. Consumer Spending: Robust retail sales and consumer confidence surveys suggest a resilient economy. These indicators collectively paint a picture of an economy that is navigating challenges effectively, providing a solid foundation for continued market strength. Understanding these broader economic currents is vital for any investor, including those in the crypto space, as they often set the stage for market-wide movements. How Do Cryptocurrency Trends React to Stock Market Health? While often seen as distinct, the world of Cryptocurrency Trends is increasingly influenced by the performance of traditional financial markets, especially the U.S. Stock Markets . For a long time, Bitcoin and other digital assets were considered uncorrelated or even inversely correlated to traditional assets. However, in recent years, particularly since the pandemic, a stronger correlation has emerged. Here’s how stock market health can influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: When traditional markets are performing well, and investor sentiment is high (a ‘risk-on’ environment), investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can trigger a ‘risk-off’ move, leading to outflows from crypto. Liquidity Flows: Positive stock market performance can free up capital or create a perception of wealth, leading some investors to diversify into crypto. Macroeconomic Context: Both stock and crypto markets react to the same overarching macroeconomic factors—inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes. It’s not a direct one-to-one relationship, and crypto markets have their own unique drivers (technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory clarity). However, ignoring the broader financial ecosystem, particularly the health of major stock markets, would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. The current positive momentum in stocks could provide a supportive backdrop, but crypto’s inherent volatility and unique characteristics mean it will always march to its own beat to some extent. What’s Next for Investors? Actionable Insights The recent positive close in U.S. Stock Markets is certainly welcome news, but it’s important for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. While the current Market Performance suggests strength and positive Investor Sentiment , markets are inherently dynamic and subject to change. Understanding these shifts, and how they relate to broader Economic Indicators , is key to navigating both traditional and digital asset landscapes. For those interested in Cryptocurrency Trends , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional market news and specific crypto developments. The interconnectedness is growing. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a diversified portfolio that considers various asset classes can help mitigate risk. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that even in a ‘risk-on’ environment, cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Look Beyond the Headlines: Dig into the underlying reasons for market movements. Is it sustainable growth, or a short-term rally? A Resilient Outlook The impressive close for U.S. Stock Markets serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and dynamic nature of global finance. This positive shift in Market Performance not only bolsters Investor Sentiment but also provides valuable insights into the current state of key Economic Indicators . While the immediate impact on Cryptocurrency Trends may not always be direct, the overall positive economic backdrop can foster an environment conducive to broader investment and growth across all asset classes. As we move forward, a keen understanding of these interconnections will be invaluable for navigating the complexities of the financial world.

2025-07-17T05:53:58,"Altcoin Season ALERT! XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout","The post Altcoin Season ALERT! XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a quiet June, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life Altcoin season. Top cryptocurrencies, including SEI, SUI, Ethereum, and XRP Price, are making notable moves. According to analysts, this altcoin rally might be led by solid Layer-1 blockchains , marking a shift away from the memecoin-driven hype. Ethereum Price Breaks Out with Bullish Signals Ethereum price today is leading the altcoin revival, surging 9% to cross $3,330. The breakout above the critical $2,800 resistance level was spotlighted by analyst Michaël van de Poppe , who views it as a strong signal of returning altcoin strength, with Ethereum at the forefront. Currently, ETH is just 9.7% away from breaking out of a massive 4-year-long accumulation triangle, a technical formation that could trigger a parabolic rally. Adding fuel to the bullish momentum, SharpLink Gaming , a publicly traded company, recently purchased 9,424.69 ETH worth $32 million, highlighting growing institutional interest in Ethereum over Bitcoin. Source : CryptosBatman X Post A potential cup-and-handle formation is also appearing on ETH charts, similar to one seen in late 2023 that preceded a 100% price surge. If Ethereum breaks the $3,100 neckline, analyst cryptosBatman expects a rise toward the $3,800 to $4,000 zone. Whales and ETH ETF Shifts Add More Fuel Supporting the bullish case is unusual whale behavior. A major short position with 18x leverage is currently sitting on a $3.5 million loss. If ETH pushes above $3,500, it could trigger a short squeeze liquidation, adding more fuel to the breakout. Meanwhile, institutional attention is growing as Ethereum slowly chips away at Bitcoin’s long-held ETF dominance, attracting serious investor interest. XRP Price Rallies on Legal Hopes and Whale Moves XRP is also seeing renewed momentum, climbing over 7% in the last 24 hours. Analysts say this could be linked to the broader altcoin shift and growing speculation around the final resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Although no official ruling has come in yet, investors are hopeful that a settlement or final clarity will open the door for U.S. exchange relistings and institutional adoption. Adding to the optimism, on-chain data shows a spike in large XRP transactions, a sign that whales may be repositioning ahead of a major move. Whales have bought 2.20 billion $XRP in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/qpZ2xK7G7J — Ali (@ali_charts) July 16, 2025 BTC Dominance Wanes, Paving the Way for Ethereum and XRP Price Surge Bitcoin’s breakout above $111,000 to $120,000 echoes previous cycles where altcoins followed shortly after. Analysts point to past bull runs, like in 2017 and 2020, where BTC’s gains paved the way for Ethereum and XRP rallies. With BTC dominance showing early signs of decline, history may be repeating as altcoins prepare for their next big move. Overall, if ETH breaks $3,500 resistance level and XRP keeps rising, a bigger rally could follow, but traders should still watch for solid volume and confirmation before going all in. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum price surged over 9% today, breaking above a critical resistance of $2,800. Analysts believe this breakout signals the return of altcoin strength, backed by bullish technical patterns and institutional buying like SharpLink Gaming’s $32 million ETH purchase. Is altcoin season starting in 2025? Analysts say yes. Altcoin season might be beginning as BTC dominance weakens and Layer-1s like Ethereum, SEI, SUI, and XRP show strong price action. A shift from memecoins to utility-driven projects is fueling this rally. Are whales accumulating Ethereum and XRP right now? On-chain data shows large ETH and XRP transactions, suggesting that whales are repositioning ahead of a major move. One ETH short whale is sitting on a $3.5M loss, which could trigger a squeeze. How is Ethereum’s ETF interest growing compared to Bitcoin? Ethereum is slowly chipping away at Bitcoin’s ETF dominance. The growing ETH spot ETF demand highlights increasing institutional interest beyond Bitcoin. What Layer-1 coins are leading the current rally? SEI, SUI, and Ethereum are currently leading the charge among Layer-1 blockchains, shifting attention away from memecoins to scalable, infrastructure-level projects. Why is XRP up today? XRP has jumped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. The surge is likely due to optimism over the potential resolution of Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC, increased whale transactions, and the overall strength of the altcoin market.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-alert-xrp-price-rallies-ethereum-price-eyes-major-breakout/,"TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|XRP|BTC","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare

Once passed, this new law will introduce the first official rules for stablecoins in the United States. It will focus on making stablecoins safer, more transparent, and widely accepted in the financial system. Analyst Dr. Altcoin explained how this could benefit USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial. USD1 is backed one-to-one with the US dollar and supported by assets like cash and US Treasuries. It has already been listed on major centralized exchanges, including MEXC, where it is paired with Pi, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies. The GENIUS Act includes strict requirements. It bans unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, demands one-to-one reserve backing, monthly public reserve updates, and yearly audits. It also limits big tech companies from launching their own stablecoins unless they follow all rules. Additionally, the bill allows for freezing or burning tokens for national security reasons. For the Pi Network, this is a great opportunity. The new PI/USD1 trading pair means Pi users now have access to a more stable, regulated, and trustworthy trading environment. This helps with accurate price discovery, better liquidity, and makes Pi more attractive to institutional investors. As USD1 gains popularity and gets listed on more exchanges, Pi Network could see increased attention and use. The GENIUS Act is not just about setting rules. It is about building a stable and compliant future for crypto. With strong support and a growing ecosystem, Pi Network and USD1 may be at the center of the next wave of crypto adoption. Pi Network has dropped 23% over the past month and is now trading at around $0.4399. The price has been moving sideways, staying in the $0.40 to $0.50 range as selling pressure continues to build due to unlocked token supply. For Pi to see a strong upward move, it needs to break above the $0.80 level. Until then, any small bounce from the current zone is likely to face resistance and lead to more price pressure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-the-genius-act-push-pi-network-price-to-new-highs-beyond-1/,"TRADING|FIAT|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T05:43:36,"Ethereum ETFs Smash Records with $727M Single-Day Inflow Surge","Spot Ethereum ETFs posted a record-breaking net inflow of $726.74m on July 16, according to data from SoSoValue . This marks the largest single-day inflow in the category’s short but rapidly growing history, pushing total cumulative net inflows to $6.48b. It’s a turning point for Ether ETFs, which initially faced investor hesitation following their approval last year. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with a staggering $499.25m in net inflows in one day, bringing its cumulative total to $7.11b. The ETF now holds $7.73b in net assets, with a market share of 1.90% of all Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $113.31m in inflows, while Grayscale’s ETHE added $33.04m despite lingering effects from early redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Ethereum Tops $3,200, Outpaces Bitcoin and Solana in Daily Gains The surge came as Ethereum crossed the key $3,200 threshold, rising more than 6.8% on the day to trade near $3,347. It outpaced both Bitcoin and Solana , reflecting growing institutional interest in the asset. Daily volumes soared, and total value traded across ETH spot ETFs reached $2.59 billion. Open interest in ETH futures has also reached a new peak of $45b, up 60% since late June. This surge in derivatives activity points to increased institutional positioning and heightened expectations of further price momentum. ETH Gains Attributed to Staking Yields, Deflation and Long-Term Utility Bitget Wallet CMO Jamie Elkaleh said Ethereum’s current momentum signals more than short-term bullishness. “Ethereum is emerging as the yield-generating infrastructure play,” he said, citing staking yields of 4% to 6% and deflationary supply mechanics post-EIP-1559. “BlackRock’s accumulation of ETH is not just about price upside—it’s a strategic position in what many see as the backbone of future onchain finance,” he added. ETH ETFs are now seen as a bridge between crypto-native strategies and traditional finance. BlackRock’s accumulation, for instance, is widely viewed as a long-term bet on Ethereum’s growing role in powering decentralized finance, NFTs and Web3 infrastructure. Investor Confidence Returns as Redemption Pressure Fades These record inflows are especially notable considering that many ETFs struggled with outflows during their early months, largely due to Grayscale trust redemptions. The July reversal suggests renewed investor confidence, now that redemption-driven selling has waned. Despite the bullish narrative, risks persist. Regulatory ambiguity around whether ETH qualifies as a security continues to hang over the market. Meanwhile, competition from high-speed alternatives like Solana and Layer 2 scaling solutions could splinter Ethereum’s dominance. Still, Ethereum’s appeal lies in its dual identity, as both a yield-bearing financial instrument and the backbone of onchain innovation.

2025-07-17T05:30:00,"ARK Invest Sells Record Amount of Bitcoin ETF Shares","This is ARK’s largest ARKB share sale by volume since the fund’s 3-for-1 stock split. ARK also recently offloaded Coinbase shares, along with smaller sales of Robinhood and Block stock. Meanwhile, a look at government Bitcoin holdings reveals that Bulgaria may have missed out on a $25 billion windfall after selling 213,519 BTC that was seized in 2017. Critics say the early sale showed very poor foresight, and contrasts very sharply with countries like the US, China, and the UK, which all hold large Bitcoin reserves. ARK Invest Dumps Bitcoin ETF Shares Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made its largest share sale of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) since the fund's mid-June stock split. It offloaded 225,742 ARKB shares from its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) on Tuesday. The transaction brought in approximately $8.7 million based on ARKB’s closing price of $38.70. Although this marks the biggest single-day ARKB sale by volume, it still trails the firm’s previous record in dollar terms, which is a $12 million sale in April that involved 159,496 shares. This move happened shortly after ARKB completed a 3-for-1 stock split , which effectively tripled the number of shares and reduced the price per share from roughly $90 to around $30. Despite the split, the fund’s market value remained unchanged, and ARKB recently traded near record highs, peaking at $39.3 on July 6. When adjusted for the stock split, that price equates to an all-time high of approximately $117.9 per share. Stock split announcement In addition to reducing its exposure to ARKB, ARK Invest also sold 34,207 shares of Coinbase (COIN) on Tuesday, bringing in $13.3 million. This sale took place after a series of recent profit-taking actions involving Coinbase, including $2 million worth of shares sold last Thursday and another $2 million sold the following day from its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). The firm also reduced its holdings in Robinhood and Block last week by selling 58,504 Robinhood shares for $5.6 million and 24,780 Block shares for $1.7 million. ARK's Circle sales on June 23 (Source: ARK Invest) While ARK has been very active in selling off several high-profile holdings, it paused further reductions in its Circle (CRCL) position after divesting 415,844 shares worth about $110 million on June 23. These strategic moves suggest ARK is rebalancing its portfolios and taking advantage of strong market performance in its crypto-related holdings. Selling Bitcoin Early Cost Bulgaria Billions ARK Invest is not alone in its profit taking spree. In 2017, Bulgaria made headlines by seizing 213,519 Bitcoin, which was valued at around $3.5 billion at the time. This was enough to cover a very large portion of the country’s national debt. The government reportedly sold the Bitcoin the next year, but there is still some speculation that it may hold some of the digital assets despite official denials. Today, that same Bitcoin stash would be worth more than $25.24 billion, which is more than Bulgaria’s current public debt of $24 billion, according to World Economics data. Bulgaria Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) While some may see the early liquidation as a missed opportunity, experts offer a more nuanced perspective. Alex Obchakevich , founder of Obchakevich Research, explained that Bitcoin’s volatility made it difficult to treat as a stable reserve asset. He argued that the risks of a sharp decline in value likely outweighed the potential upside at the time. A more balanced strategy, he said, would have involved holding 10–15% of the Bitcoin, slowly liquidating the rest, and using derivatives for hedging. Others, however, were more critical of the government’s move. Robert Znidar , director at Iconomi, attributed the decision to a lack of understanding of Bitcoin’s philosophy and long-term utility. He believes that given today’s increased institutional acceptance of crypto, such a decision would likely not be repeated. Similarly, Bulgarian native and co-CEO of Web3 market maker Enflux, Valentin Mihov , reflected on how governments at the time misunderstood crypto’s strategic potential. He acknowledged that concerns around custody, regulation, and EU fiscal policy played a big role in the decision, but suggested a partial hold would have been a lot wiser. A 10–20% strategic reserve, he said, could have positioned Bulgaria as a forward-thinking leader in sovereign Bitcoin adoption. The situation draws a sharp contrast with other governments, many of which hold large amounts of Bitcoin. According to recent data, countries collectively hold around 463,000 BTC, about 2.3% of the total supply. Governments holding Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The United States leads with over 198,000 BTC, followed closely by China with 190,000. Other top holders include the United Kingdom with 61,245 BTC, Ukraine with 46,351, and North Korea with 13,562, much of which was reportedly acquired through state-sponsored cyberattacks. Bhutan, with 10,486 BTC, rounds out the top six.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10005/ark-invest-sells-record-amount-of-bitcoin-etf-shares,"BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T05:22:08,"Top Four Global Crypto Exchanges Listed in Q2 2025","The post Top Four Global Crypto Exchanges Listed in Q2 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the growing global demand for cryptocurrency in 2025, some assets experienced massive growth. According to the analysis , Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget are the top four exchanges in Q2 2025 in terms of spot and derivatives markets. As Bitcoin skyrocketed in recent days and made history with the value of $122,000, the crypto exchanges’ activity increased. Top Four Cryptocurrency Exchanges in Q2 2025 Binance: Binance held a trading volume share of 35.39%, making a strong position in the global competition. Despite the slight decrease from Q1 2025, which was approximately 36.57%, Binance’s share trading volume remained the largest market during Q2 of the year. OKX: The OKX’s market share increased by 1.08%, marking 14.34% in Q2 2025. The increased percentage suggests that OKX attracted more trading activity, probably due to strong product offerings, deeper liquidity in derivatives, and other promotional activities. Bybit: In Q2 2025, Bybit dipped from 13.06% to 12.26% but still retained its position in the top crypto exchanges for the year. Despite enduring the largest crypto hack of $1.5 billion in February 2025, the exchange replenished its reserves within 72 hours and took decisive measures to reinforce users’ trust. Bitget: Bidet added over 2 million new users in Q2 2025, contributing to a higher platform activity of 11.45%. Driven by its product innovation, such as AI-powered tools, the platform expanded its global reach, marking a slight increase of 0.14% from Q1 2025. What Contributed to the Trading Volume of Crypto Exchanges in Q2 2025? With new laws, clarity in regulations, and high demand for crypto assets, the crypto exchange market reached $21.6 trillion with its top 10 crypto exchanges in Q2 2025. The value of Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana, and other crypto assets has surged, likely contributing to the trading volume of exchanges. However, despite all contributions, the overall trading volume across the top exchanges declined in Q2. The downfall is likely an outcome of the hesitant retailer participation, slow regulatory progress, geopolitical tensions, and legal uncertainties.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-four-global-crypto-exchanges-listed-in-q2-2025/,"EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T05:17:20,"Crypto Regulations in Japan 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Japan 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of unregulated crypto use, Japan became the first economy to formally recognize Bitcoin as a legal payment method through the Payment Services Act (PSA) 2017. As of 2025, Japan has developed one of the most comprehensive and proactive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency. Currently, Japan is actively working on classifying crypto assets as financial instruments, bringing them under stricter financial regulations by 2026. Crypto Regulations in Japan June 25, 2025 – 55th Financial System Council (FSC) Meeting The key discussion was to reclassify certain digital assets under FIEA, especially those with investment-like features. Additionally, tokens are classified in the same category as securities. It introduced mandatory disclosure for token issuers, insider trading, market conduct regulations, and clarity in legal frameworks for crypto ETFs, including spot bitcoin products. March 2025- Proposal for Reformation in Crypto Brokerage and Stabecoin Laws Japanese Cabinet Minister approved a proposal to reform the laws, allowing cryptocurrency companies to operate as an ‘intermediary business.’ The new bill provides flexibility to stablecoin issuers to back their tokens with various types of assets. Crypto brokerage will no longer be subject to financial regulations or anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Timeline of Major Crypto Regulations in Japan Date Law/ Regulation Key Provisions December 20, 2024 Crypto Tax Reformation Shifting from a progressive rate of 55% to a flat 20% tax June 1, 2023 Crypto Travel Rule Mandatory sender/ receiver info for crypto transfer May 1, 2020 PSA &FIEA Amendments New AML, cybersecurity, and security token regulation June 7, 2019 AML/ Custody Rules Stricter KYC, record keeping, and annual compliance report April 1, 2017 PSA Enforcement Regulating crypto with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) registration 2016 PSA and Fund Settlement Law Amendment Cryptocurrency is recognized as legal tender What is the Japanese Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency in 2025? Currently, the government is proactively developing its regulatory framework to enhance security and facilitate the crypto market. Key focuses are: Japan’s Finance Minister, Katsunobu Kato, announced that Japan will review crypto tax by the end of June 2025; possibilities of a new tax regime indicated. The Democratic Party’s Web3 Project Team has put forward a proposal for crypto classification under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ). The government aims to increase the cashless economy to 40% by 2025 with blockchain development . Japan aims to become a crypto leader with a focus on legal registration of crypto exchanges and platforms, market integrity, investor protection, and anti-money laundering. Crypto Tax in Japan 2025 Is crypto taxed in Japan? Yes, cryptocurrency is taxed as ‘miscellaneous income’ with a progressive income tax rate. There is no capital gains tax enacted yet in Japan. What falls under miscellaneous income? Selling crypto for fiat currency Exchange crypto for crypto Buying goods and services with crypto Gifting and payment in crypto Earning staking rewards from liquidity pools Receiving coins from forks Mining, Airdrops, DeFi, and Referral bonus On March 6, Japan proposed a crypto tax cut from a progressive rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% on crypto tax gains. However, the bill has not been passed yet to implement the tax reduction. FSA is expected to review this reclassification; if approved, it will likely take effect from 2026. Tax type Tax rate Note Income tax 5% to 45% Depends on the individual’s total income Additional inhabitant tax 10% Resulting in 15% to 55% tax rate Capital gains tax (CGT) Not specified yet Crypto as a financial product Reclassification of CGT 20% for stock profits Not enacted yet Crypt License in Japan Under the Payment Services Act (PSA), the Financial Services Agency (FSA) is the key body regulating mandatory crypto licenses. How to get a crypto license in Japan? Crypto exchanges and platforms are required to register with the FSA to provide crypto asset exchange services (CAES). Crypto companies need to establish a local entity, typically a Kabushiki Kaisha, a joint stock company. A minimum capital of over 10 million yen is required; other fees depend on the license and business model. A physical office in Japan is mandatory with a Japanese bank account. Experts are required to follow strict AM and CFT regulations. Crypto Adoption in Japan Penetration Rate: Japan has experienced a positive increase in crypto adoption rate, with current penetration projected to be 14.70% in 2025 and is expected to reach even higher, up to 15.26% by 2026. The number of crypto users in Japan is expected to increase up to 18.69 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: Current revenue in the crypto market is expected to reach US$2.0 billion in 2025, with an anticipated growth rate of 3.44% resulting in a total amount of US$2.0 billion by 2026. Crypto Holdings: It is not publicly known whether the Japanese government holds any crypto assets; rather focuses on increasing the adoption rate with a modern regulatory framework. Conclusion In Japan, the government’s crypto holdings is not publicly known; however, public companies like Metaplanet are known to be one of the biggest crypto holders in Japan. The country has several new proposals in hand that are waiting for review and will likely take effect from 2026. As of 2025, Japan’s regulatory framework has reflected positive results with solid earnings and enhanced protection measures for investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Clear acceleration. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 17, 2025 At current rates, Ethereum ETFs are consuming more than a hundred times more ETH than is being produced every day. Moreover, US spot ETFs now hold around 5 million ETH, or 4% of the total supply. There has been an aggregate inflow of $6 billion across all spot Ethereum ETFs since inception, but half of that has come in just the past five trading days. In addition to the institutional funds hoovering up the asset, a new wave of Ethereum treasury companies is adding to the buying pressure. There is currently 1.6 million ETH worth around $5.3 billion in these corporate treasuries, and the asset is being purchased at a rate 36 times higher than is being produced, according to Strategic Eth Reserve. Additionally, Ethereum-based digital investment funds posted their twelfth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $990 million, the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record, according to asset manager CoinShares. In related news, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF, according to a filing on July 16. ETH Price Surges to Six-Month High Ethereum prices have surged 7.5% on the day to top out at a six-month high of $3,420 in late trading on Wednesday. ETH cooled a little from this peak, its highest since January 18, and was trading at $3,350 at the time of writing. The asset has gained a whopping 30% over the past fortnight, outperforming Bitcoin , which has notched 8.5% in the same period.

2025-07-17T05:00:54,"Miner Position Index Rises As Bitcoin Rebounds Post-CPI Data—Here’s What It Means","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of recovery following a brief market retreat triggered by the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) update. The asset had slipped to lows near $116,000 following inflation data. However, BTC has rebounded since, reaching $119,248 earlier today and trading at $119,187 at the time of writing, roughly 3.1% below its all-time high of $123,000 set earlier this week. While broader macroeconomic concerns are shaping price sentiment, new on-chain metrics from the mining sector are drawing attention. A CryptoQuant analyst has watched miner activity closely, as some key indicators suggest that miners may be preparing to sell. This development could influence short-term price action, though the broader outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged, according to the analyst. Bitcoin Miner Behavior Points to Short-Term Pressures CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain highlighted in a recent post that the Miner Position Index (MPI) has jumped to 2.7. This index compares the amount of Bitcoin being moved by miners to exchanges with the historical one-year average. A high MPI reading generally implies increased selling intent, as miners move assets to trading platforms. Avocado noted that the current reading may indicate mild selling pressure, which could contribute to a near-term correction or sideways trading pattern. However, he also emphasized that the current MPI value is still far from the elevated levels typically observed at market cycle peaks. The analyst suggested that this activity may be part of a recurring intra-cycle trend in which brief corrections are followed by further upward movement. He advised that it remains uncertain whether this miner activity marks a one-off event or signals a larger selling wave. Either scenario may affect short-term volatility, but not necessarily the broader trajectory. Network Flows Support the Data Trend In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain examined the implications of increased miner activity. According to their findings, network data reveals a noticeable uptick in miner-related movements, levels last seen in November 2024. Arab Chain explained that while miner activity on the blockchain is rising, this alone doesn’t confirm sales unless Bitcoin is transferred to exchanges.

They observed a correlation between BTC transfers to exchanges and Bitcoin’s recent climb above $116,000. This movement may indicate that miners view current prices as favorable for selling, possibly to cover operational costs or secure liquidity. The data also hints at miners anticipating a potential correction, which could drive more transfers and further market fluctuations. They concluded that the extent of any correction would largely depend on whether this wave of miner activity persists.

2025-07-17T05:00:53,"XRP Futures Set CME Record: $235 Million Traded In One Day","Data shows the XRP futures volume on CME has hit a new daily record, a potential sign of surging institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Total XRP CME Futures Volume Has Crossed $1.6 Billion According to data from CME Active Trader , an official X handle of the CME Group focused on trading, the combined XRP and Micro XRP futures volume set a new record on Friday. The CME Group is the largest derivatives marketplace in the world, operating multiple platforms such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company offers regulated futures and options trading products across a wide range of asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin futures trading was added to the platform back in 2017, with offerings for Ethereum becoming available in 2021. XRP futures finally launched in May of this year. Futures trading is available in two forms for the asset: XRP and Micro XRP. The former features contracts sized at 50,000 tokens each, while the latter offers a smaller size of 2,500 tokens per contract. On the milestone-setting July 11th, more than 9,100 CME futures contracts for the asset were traded, equivalent to over 82 million coins or $235 million. “The record underscores the rapidly growing demand in our new XRP futures suite,” noted CME Active Trader in the X post. Since the launch, total notional traded has amounted to $1.6 billion. The CME Group is widely considered to be the preferred derivatives platform for institutional traders , thanks to its regulated offerings. As such, the spike in the futures trading volume on the exchange can be an indication of rising demand among institutions. Futures trading on CME reflects just one side of the sector. Here’s how the combined futures metrics related to the asset currently look for all platforms, according to Glassnode data: While trading activity related to the token may have jumped high on Friday, the latest trend is that of a decline, as futures volume across exchanges has dropped by more than 40% over the last 24 hours. That said, daily volume still stands at $8.4 billion for the cryptocurrency, which is larger than the other major altcoins save for Solana at $9.1 billion. Bitcoin has the highest volume at $78.6 billion, but its ratio relative to its market cap (0.033) is worse than XRP’s (0.048). Funding rates are positive across the market at the moment, suggesting a degree of long-term dominance. Dogecoin and Tron seem to be receiving the most bullish bets, with the metric sitting at 0.0143% and 0.0121%, respectively. XRP follows the two with a funding rate of 0.0113%. Thus, while trading activity may have plunged during the past day, sentiment around the asset remains positive. Token Price XRP has witnessed a sharp surge of over 24% in the last week, which has brought its price to $2.95.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-futures-cme-record-235-million-traded-one-day/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET","XRP|XRP CME Futures|XRP futures|XRP Record|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
