2025-07-17T17:47:30,"Pakistan and El Salvador Strengthen Diplomatic Ties With New Crypto Alliance","Key Takeaways: Pakistan and El Salvador formalize diplomatic ties with crypto at the center. Pakistan plans a national Bitcoin reserve and regulatory body for oversight. El Salvador maintains active Bitcoin purchases under an IMF deal. Pakistan and El Salvador have initiated formal diplomatic ties centered on cryptocurrency cooperation, according to a report published by Bloomberg . The partnership follows a meeting in San Salvador between Bilal Bin Saqib, special assistant to Pakistan‚Äôs prime minister on crypto and blockchain, and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Pakistan and El Salvador Partner for Digital Assets The discussions focused on knowledge-sharing in digital asset infrastructure and policy, while Pakistan plans to structure its crypto markets under regulatory oversight. Pakistan recently allocated 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and intends to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. The government previously launched the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) to oversee the domestic digital asset market. Pakistan creates digital assets regulator PVARA to oversee crypto industry with @cz_binance and @saylor as strategic advisors amid massive 40M users and $300B annual trading volume. #Pakistan #Crypto https://t.co/sGm3VPdu1M ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 Earlier this year, Saqib stated that up to 20 million Pakistanis currently hold crypto, despite ongoing caution from the country‚Äôs central bank. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and continues to acquire the asset while under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement. According to government figures, the country holds 6,238 Bitcoins. Tether also opened a headquarters there in January. Bitcoin Acquisition vs IMF Agreement Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF program that runs through 2027. The fund has expressed concerns about state-level digital asset purchases, but El Salvador has continued its policy regardless of the terms. ‚ÄúBitcoin keeps being an important project,‚Äù said El Salvador‚Äôs economy minister , Maria Luisa Hayem, when the government purchased seven Bitcoins despite the agreement with the IMF. ‚ÄúThere is an asset accumulation that we‚Äôre seeing from the government perspective, from the private sector perspective.‚Äù By forming bilateral channels focused on infrastructure and governance, countries under IMF influence may seek greater autonomy in structuring digital asset policies without triggering compliance issues or threatening macroeconomic stability. Other emerging economies with large unbanked populations are also exploring sovereign digital asset programs, seeking to reduce reliance on foreign exchange reserves and expand financial access without altering core monetary frameworks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could this agreement lead to joint mining or shared infrastructure between Pakistan and El Salvador? While not disclosed in current statements, both countries are actively investing in Bitcoin mining. Future collaboration could include technology transfer, operational partnerships, or coordinated infrastructure planning if aligned under bilateral frameworks. How does Pakistan‚Äôs crypto stance compare with other IMF program countries? Most IMF-supported nations have either restricted or delayed digital asset integration. Pakistan‚Äôs move to create a national reserve and regulatory authority places it ahead in formal crypto adoption among peers under similar fiscal supervision. What challenges might Pakistan face in implementing a national Bitcoin reserve? Potential obstacles include central bank resistance, volatility management, custodial infrastructure, and compliance with existing IMF conditions. Legal clarity on asset classification and secure storage mechanisms will also be essential.

This has fueled speculation of an impending multi-billion-dollar sell-off. According to on-chain analyst Lookonchain, nearly half of the whale‚Äôs 80,000 BTC (worth over $4.7 billion at current prices) was moved into new wallets recently. The abrupt action has spooked traders, especially with Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price strength above $123,000. $4.7B in BTC Transferred Between Wallets The whale began transferring with a 9,000 BTC transaction‚Äîapproximately $1.06 billion‚Äîto wallets linked with Galaxy Digital. Shortly after, 7,823 BTC (around $927 million) was sent next. Then the mass migration occurred: 40,009 BTC‚Äîworth $4.68 billion‚Äîwas dispersed into new wallet addresses. Though some analysts theorize the activity may represent internal restructurings or security precautions, the destinations suggest another possibility. Hints of a Potential Sell-Off? The transfers to Galaxy Digital were just the beginning. On-chain metrics show the firm moved 6,000 BTC ($706 million) to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit‚Äîa strong indication that some of the coins may be about to hit the market. Whales sell at tops, and with Bitcoin changing hands for approximately $118,200, traders are on high alert. Should all 40,000 BTC find its way to exchanges, it could lead to high short-term volatility. More Dormant Wallets Stir This whale isn‚Äôt alone. A different long-dormant wallet transferred 1,042 BTC ($122.5 million) earlier today after being inactive for six years. Purchased when Bitcoin was trading at just $8,746, the stash was worth less than $10 million initially. The heightened activity among older wallets aligns with Bitcoin flirting with new highs.

2025-07-17T17:27:07,"Where Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto Ranks Among The Richest After Recent Rises: If BTC Price Surpasses Here, He Will Overtake Warren Buffett","Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has now become the 11th richest person in the world, with the value of his cryptocurrencies exceeding $130 billion. According to Arkham Intelligence data, the value of Bitcoins in wallets thought to belong to Nakamoto has surpassed that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates ($117 billion) and Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell ($126.5 billion), with the BTC price increasing by 14 percent in the last month. Calculated at Bitcoin's current price of $118,912, this wealth puts Satoshi just $12 billion behind Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has long been known for his critical stance against Bitcoin. Buffett's net worth, according to Forbes, is $141 billion. If Bitcoin rises by about 8 percent to $128,650, Satoshi will surpass Buffett. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: The US Government Allegedly Holds Far Fewer Bitcoins Than Estimated - Big if True In a 2022 statement, Buffett described Bitcoin as ‚Äúrat poison‚Äù and said he wouldn't buy all the Bitcoins, even for $25. Since then, Bitcoin's value has increased by 204%. While the exact amount of Bitcoin owned by Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown, a widely accepted analysis is known as the ‚ÄúPatoshi Pattern.‚Äù The consistent activity of a single miner observed in early Bitcoin blocks suggests that Satoshi mined approximately 22,000 blocks. This analysis suggests that Nakamoto may have approximately 1.1 million BTC. Arkham Intelligence's estimate of 1.09 million BTC also aligns with this approach. Satoshi's true identity remains unknown. An HBO documentary released last fall suggested that Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd might be Satoshi, but Todd and many viewers dismissed this theory. Similarly, early Bitcoin contributors Adam Back and Hal Finney have also been cited, but both have denied these claims. Tech giants like Elon Musk have also been suggested as Satoshi, but his identity remains unclear. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-17T17:16:53,"Bitwise Bitcoin ETF: Bull Market Still Running On One Engine","Summary Institutional flows via spot Bitcoin ETFs are driving the current Bitcoin market rally, with BITB and others seeing sustained inflows despite recent price consolidation. Retail participation remains muted, as seen in declining spot exchange volumes and high Bitcoin dominance, suggesting we‚Äôre still early in the bull cycle. BITB offers asymmetric upside, providing direct exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs spot price with institutional tailwinds now and retail momentum still to come. It's been ~18 months since the spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading, and at this juncture, most investors have moved beyond the granular details in their preference for a specific ETF to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The ETFs all offer similar structure and tracking accuracy, save for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), which has maintained a higher 1.5% expense ratio. We're also now past the early marketing incentives, like the six-month fee waiver on some of the ETFs. Personally, I favor the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITB ) as my preferred vehicle because of the fund‚Äôs alignment with the broader Bitcoin development ethos; they donate 10% of their profits to open-source Bitcoin development. Bitwise was also the first fund manager to publish the Bitcoin addresses for its ETF holdings. Investors can track the inflows and outflows of the actual BTC in the fund in real-time, using the addresses. This week, Bitwise retired the approach of verifying the ETF's BTC holdings via the published addresses and has introduced a more robust and institutional-grade framework for verifying the fund‚Äôs on-chain reserves and financial integrity through a third-party proof-of-reserves system, verified daily by a U.S.-based licensed CPA firm. Instead of just listing on-chain BTC holdings, this new verification method reconciles on-chain holdings with the ETFs' outstanding shares and will soon include CPA-attested reports that verify both assets and liabilities, thereby delivering a more comprehensive and investor-friendly form of transparency. Think of this in a similar vein to the independent audit performed on companies prior to a 10-Q or 10-K filing, but the scope here is limited to on-chain digital asset balances and ETF share liabilities. And the verification happens daily. With the latest updates on BITB and their proof-of-reserves verification already mentioned, the truth is, there‚Äôs not much left to say about the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves that hasn't already been covered by analysts here on Seeking Alpha. The products are now largely standardized - same underlying asset, similar tracking, fees narrowing, and with early incentives fading. I believe the questions now on most investors' minds would be whether Bitcoin's momentum sustains, navigating macro headwinds and their potential impact on Bitcoin and its related assets, and the profit-taking strategies at BTC's all-time highs. For most investors, it is now much less about which specific spot Bitcoin ETF to choose and more about how the underlying asset performs and how to position to maximize returns. BITB vs BTC price trend on a YTD basis (Seeking Alpha) With the spot Bitcoin ETFs' underlying asset, Bitcoin, showing momentum lately, the ETFs have naturally followed the price action of Bitcoin. The spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves have been an immense catalyst that has made Bitcoin more mainstream this past year, and recently broke a new all-time high just above $121,000 . Since the April Liberation Day tariffs sell-offs when BTC dipped below $80,000, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $6 billion in inflows. The spot ETFs now hold a total of ~1.28 million BTC or about 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total 21 million supply, bringing total assets under management [AuM] for the total ETFs to a staggering $154 billion (as of July 17, 2025). Since the launch of the spot ETFs, Bitcoin has seen accelerated comebacks after every price dip. Every dip has been followed by an uptrend that breaks the previous all-time high; basically, higher highs and higher lows. TheBlock The interest in the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been increasingly institutional - the trade volumes of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategy among publicly-traded companies prove this institutional interest. The cumulative trade volume since the spot Bitcoin ETF launched now surpasses $1 trillion (shown in the preceding chart). And for the first half of this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs nearly matched about 40% of the net inflows into physically backed gold ETFs. Which is impressive, considering the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched less than two years ago. Physically-backed gold ETFs recorded $38 billion in inflows in H1, while the physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs (ditto the spot Bitcoin ETFs) have seen $14.83 billion in net inflows so far this year, already flipping its own 2024‚Äôs net inflows (see the chart below). As both the gold and the Bitcoin flows data show, digital gold (Bitcoin) is gaining ground and competing strongly with physical gold. 2024 cumulative net inflows vs 2025 YTD cumulative net inflows (CryptoQuant) Having highlighted these data points that show Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional appeal and structural maturity as a mainstream asset, let's go back to the more pressing question for most retail investors at the moment, who make up a great number of the readership here and for the broader retail cohort: how much longer can BTC‚Äôs momentum sustain before retail FOMO kicks in and accelerates price discovery even further? I believe retail participation has always been pivotal for the peak of Bitcoin market cycles, as retail trades typically make up much of the final wave of market momentum, before an inevitable drawdown or price correction. In the current cycle, the late-stage retail buyers (the so-called ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù) have mostly been sidelined so far (as I‚Äôll show from some data), and this absence of broader retail euphoria suggests that the final leg of the bull run is still ahead. I think it is too early to call a cycle top. In Bitcoin‚Äôs cycles, historically, retail FOMO tends to accelerate price discovery dramatically toward the cycle top. Therefore, positioning before this general retail FOMO has always been one of the most effective strategies to capture outsized gains from Bitcoin bull markets. How Has Retail Been Sidelined in the Current Bitcoin Market Cycle In the past, the price trend of Bitcoin has closely mirrored the volume trend of retail trades on crypto exchanges. That price/volume relationship has been noticeably weaker since the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notice from the chart below how since early 2024 (time of the spot ETFs launch), Bitcoin price has decoupled from retail-driven BTC trade volume on crypto exchanges. And it has been more pronounced lately - as BTC rose above $100k, retail volume took an inverse trajectory (as seen in the chart below). Bitcoin price vs spot volume trend (Bitcoinity) Meanwhile, the spot ETF flows and volume have been directly influencing Bitcoin spot price. As shown in the next chart, there's a clear visual correlation between periods of sustained positive inflows (green bars) and rising Bitcoin prices, and periods of sustained outflows (red bars) and falling Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin price vs spot ETFs new flows (SoSoValue) Now, the essence of these two comparisons in this piece - showing waning retail activity vs BTC price correlation with the spot ETF flows - is to highlight the thesis that the market still has room to run. The next big question is timing when retail re-enters in full force. I‚Äôd say there is no analysis that would definitely pinpoint that timing, but based on historical patterns and market psychology, retail typically piles in late in a bull cycle - once price is already well into price discovery, then the media is flooded with back-to-back headlines of fresh all-time high price (the ‚ÄúBitcoin is going to $1 million‚Äù type frenzy), and anecdotal FOMO is everywhere. The current sentiment backdrop hasn't shown any of these yet. The spot volumes on crypto exchanges I already mentioned, and Google Trends data for Bitcoin search terms, suggest retail is still sidelined. And further on-chain data shows that the retail trade hasn't been going into altcoins either, as some investors may speculate; Bitcoin dominance still remains elevated above 62%. Even Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) surge over $3,000 since Tuesday (July 15) has been primarily linked to institutional flows into the spot Ethereum ETFs. The spot Ethereum ETFs saw record daily net inflows of ~$726 million . Bitcoin dominance (TradingView) My goal in this piece is to make investors understand that the retail frenzy, which typically marks the later stages of a crypto bull cycle, hasn‚Äôt arrived yet (as data shown throughout this article have shown). This means Bitcoin still likely has room to run, especially if this early momentum driven by institutional flows continues and draws more attention from mainstream media, thereby giving retail that psychological green light for an entry. Until then, institutional capital will keep driving the trend. But when retail does finally flood in, history suggests it won‚Äôt be a subtle entry; it‚Äôll most likely come with euphoric headlines, parabolic price moves, and a FOMO that feeds on itself. We‚Äôre not there yet, and that‚Äôs exactly where the opportunity lies. Investors should bear in mind that the spot Bitcoin ETFs‚Äô share prices are directly impacted by the underlying Bitcoin spot price, and with Bitcoin being an inherently volatile asset, the spot ETF shares also carry significant potential for volatility. In the near term, let‚Äôs not also forget the potential for a tariff-driven macro shakeup, as the August 1 deadline for President Trump‚Äôs reciprocal trade tariffs draws closer. I'll close this piece with this simile: the Bitcoin bull market is like a twin-engine jet. At the moment, it‚Äôs flying on just one engine, which is institutional flows. The other engine - retail participation - hasn‚Äôt powered on yet. But when it does, that‚Äôs when things really take off.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801996-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-bull-market-still-running-on-one-engine?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","BTC-USD|GBTC|BITB",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T17:14:27,"Ethereum‚Äôs market cap hit $422.7 billion after a 5% price jump above $3,400","Ethereum ripped past a $410 billion market cap on Wednesday after jumping 5% to $3,400, its highest level since February, according to figures pulled from CoinGecko. The surge came as a wave of capital flowed into spot exchange-traded funds tied to the crypto. Nine ETH ETFs saw their largest-ever daily net inflow, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA ETF alone pulling in $499 million. This spike in ETF interest comes as part of a larger July trend. So far this month, ETH funds have attracted $2.27 billion in net inflows, the highest monthly figure since these investment vehicles launched in July 2024. This is straight-up institutional firepower. Eight of the nine funds logged positive flows for the day. Institutions stack Ether and treat it like gold Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, said Ethereum is no longer being treated like a trading token. ‚ÄúEthereum is increasingly being seen as a long-term institutional asset, not just a trading vehicle,‚Äù Rachael said. She pointed out that the ETFs now hold about 4% of Ethereum‚Äôs total market cap, a number that spells just how much capital is pouring in. She didn‚Äôt stop there. ‚ÄúCombine that with more than US$2.5B in daily trading volume, bullish chart setups, and capital rotation out of bitcoin, and you‚Äôve got a breakout that‚Äôs being driven by both fundamentals and sentiment,‚Äù Rachael added. The second-largest crypto is also being stockpiled on-chain. SharpLink Gaming, which is backed by Consensys, has now overtaken the Ethereum Foundation as the largest known ETH holder. As of July 15, it controls 280,706 ETH, and it added another 20,279 ETH on Wednesday. The data was confirmed by Arkham. This is an entity moving tens of millions of dollars in ETH like it‚Äôs a normal Wednesday. Gamesquare pours over $90 million into Ethereum Elsewhere, GameSquare Holdings priced a major underwritten public offering of 46,666,667 shares at $1.50 each, raising $70 million in gross proceeds before costs. The company said it plans to use the bulk of this raise to expand its Ethereum position. That‚Äôs built into the company‚Äôs roadmap through its alliance with Dialectic, a crypto-focused capital management and yield firm. Justin Kenna, GameSquare‚Äôs CEO, made it clear. ‚ÄúThis raise marks a pivotal milestone for GameSquare. It enables us to move with speed and scale to continue to build what we believe is one of the most ambitious Ethereum treasury strategies in the public markets. Our goal is to transform a traditional treasury function into a high-performance business vertical generating durable, recurring cash flows.‚Äù The deal includes a 15% overallotment option, which, if exercised, would increase the total raise to $80.5 million. That comes on top of another $9.2 million raised just last week. If you‚Äôre counting, that‚Äôs more than $90 million in total gross proceeds aimed directly at Ethereum. Justin said the company is targeting ETH deployments across Dialectic-engineered strategies that have historically produced 8‚Äì14% on-chain yields. He explained, ‚ÄúWe believe this approach, combined with staking income and potential ETH appreciation, has the potential to deliver millions in annual incremental revenue. That cash flow can fund further ETH purchases and support broader growth initiatives across our platform.‚Äù He ended the statement by saying the company is staying fully committed to its Ethereum strategy and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Lucid Capital Markets is managing the offering as the sole book-runner. That means the entire raise, allocations, and institutional pipeline is flowing through them.

2025-07-17T17:00:02,"Did The US Government Dump 170,000 BTC? Marshals Reveal Shocking Bitcoin Holdings","A rumor is rapidly spreading among crypto investors that the US government may have quietly sold off nearly 170,000 BTC, leaving a fraction of its assumed holdings intact. The speculation began after the US Marshals Service, in response to a FOIA request, revealed that it currently holds only 28,988 BTC valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Many crypto investors took this disclosure to mean that the federal government‚Äôs total Bitcoin reserves had declined from the long-assumed figure of around 200,000 BTC. The claim was amplified across the social media platform X, where even some public figures reacted to what appears to be a massive strategic sell-off by the US government. FOIA Request Misinterpreted The confusion of the US government selling the majority of its Bitcoin holdings appears to stem from misinterpretations of the specific holdings of the US Marshals Service with those of the entire federal government. The FOIA request that sparked the debate was submitted by journalist L0la L33tz, and it accurately reflects that the Marshals control just under 29,000 BTC. However, this only accounts for the Bitcoin under the custody of that particular agency. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted Bitcoin‚Äôs Rally To $120,000 Months Ago, Here‚Äôs The Rest Of The Forecast On-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence provides a very different picture. According to Arkham, the US government as a whole still holds approximately 198,000 BTC, worth over $23.46 billion at the current price of Bitcoin. These coins are distributed across various federal agencies and are not limited to the Marshals‚Äô holdings. Nevertheless, the misrepresentation took hold quickly. Even US Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a well-known advocate of Bitcoin, responded to the rumor, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves, leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race.‚Äù What If the US Quietly Sold 170,000 BTC? The repercussions on the broader crypto market would be immense if the US government had indeed sold off 170,000 BTC in secret. A sale of that scale would unleash massive selling pressure and cause a strong drop in the price of Bitcoin. This would erode confidence among investors in the wider crypto market and set off a chain reaction of liquidations across other cryptocurrencies. Such a move would not only cause technical breakdowns in price structure but also cancel out the possibility of governments around the world holding crypto as a form of strategic reserve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season ‚Äî Details Moreover, such a dump would directly contradict the federal policy direction set earlier this year. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to transfer their Bitcoin and digital asset holdings to the US Treasury. The order formalized the creation of a Bitcoin reserve, which was meant to recognize the cryptocurrency as a national asset. In light of that policy, the notion that the US would quietly sell off the majority of its Bitcoin holdings seems highly improbable under the current Trump administration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,360.
