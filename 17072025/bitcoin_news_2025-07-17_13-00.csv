2025-07-17T10:54:51,"Whales and hackers are winning the Ethereum pump","Ethereum (ETH) is riding on a huge bullish wave, smashing all the highly anticipated price levels. ETH just smashed past $3,400 mark, looking to get over $3,500 now, and whales can’t keep calm. The largest altcoin price has jumped by 23% over the last 7 days. The ongoing Ethereum price surge has grabbed the attention from Bitcoin’s ATH rally and triggered sentiments of altcoin season in the market. Bitcoin price dropped to below the $118K level after hitting a fresh ATH of above $123K. The global digital assets market cap surged by 1.5% over the last day to stand at $3.81 trillion. Trump buys, hacker sells According to the data shared by Lookonchain, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) splashed $10 million USDC to buy 3,007 ETH at an average of $3,326. The fund has been hoarding ETH since November, now sitting on 70,505 ETH worth $230 million, with a neat $7 million in paper gains. It added that from November 29, 2024, to March 5, 2025, WLF has accumulated 66,275 Ethereum (approx. worth $215 million) at an average price of $3,243. They’re not alone as SharpLink Gaming also jumped in. In just 5 hours, they vacuumed up 20,279 ETH (approx. worth $68.38 million). This move brings their 8-day binge to 111,609 ETH (worth $343 million). However, a mysterious whale 0x35fb resurfaced and scooped 7,980 ETH from Kraken. This whale has been busy buying 88,292 ETH in the last week alone. That’s nearly $300 million drifting off exchanges. This suggests that someone’s getting ready for something big or knows something we don’t. Meanwhile, not every whale is swimming upstream as two major players have dumped a combined 178,080 ETH (approx. worth $528 million). Trend Research, which bought 184,115 ETH between February and June at $2,118 average, just cashed out 79,470 ETH for $250 million. They still hold 105,664 Ethereum. Then there’s the whale who made $30 million in past ETH trades. It bought over 132K ETH during June’s dip and is now cashing out fast, unloading 98K ETH since the pump began. The whale still got 35K ETH on standby, though. Source: Lookonchain . Even hackers are going all out. Remember the Infini exploit from February—the attacker who looted $49.5M and spent it on 17,696 ETH at $2,798. As ETH’s price jumped, its holdings ballooned to $59.6 million. He just sold 1,770 ETH for nearly $6 million. ETH ETFs had their best day ever This spike is not Whales’ game only, as ETH linked ETFs reported their best day ever. On Wednesday alone, they pulled in a record $726.74 million in net inflows, and now total ETH ETF assets top $16.41 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA led with nearly $500 million while Fidelity’s FETH stood second with $113 million of inflow. Ethereum price is up 22% this month, and running up by 117% over the last 90 days. Meanwhile, we haven’t even broken the all-time high yet. The ETF effect is real, as July’s inflows have already hit $2.27 billion, the highest since these funds launched last year. ETH is trading at an average price of $3,463 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 34% to stand at $51 billion.

2025-07-17T10:52:57,"UK Ministers Consider Ban on Crypto Donations Over Foreign Interference Fears","Ministers in the United Kingdom are considering a ban on cryptocurrency donations to political parties, citing concerns about traceability and the potential for foreign interference in domestic elections. Pat McFadden, a Cabinet Office minister, raised the issue on Tuesday, emphasizing the need for public trust in the funding of political activities. McFadden responded to a question from Labour party member Liam Byrne, stating that the UK should ensure its laws remain updated to safeguard the integrity of its democratic processes. “The funding of democracy is often a controversial area, but it’s very important that we know who is providing the donation, whether they are properly registered, and what the bona fides of that donation are,” McFadden noted, supporting the idea of a potential ban. Crypto Donations Raise Transparency Questions The discussion comes at a time when crypto donations have been gaining traction in the United States , with President Donald Trump openly accepting contributions in digital assets. In contrast, the UK’s cautious stance reflects a growing divide in global approaches to crypto’s role in politics. The debate in the UK intensified after Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party declared it would accept political donations in Bitcoin, becoming the first UK party to do so. Meanwhile, an anti-corruption nonprofit in the UK recently published a report warning that crypto donations could increase the risk of funds from criminal sources or foreign entities entering the political system, potentially leading to “future political interference schemes.” Both McFadden and Byrne suggested that strengthening the UK’s National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission could help address the concerns around crypto’s influence on politics while maintaining transparency in political funding. Global Pushback on Crypto Contributions The UK joins other countries and regions that are re-evaluating crypto’s place in campaign finance. In 2022, Ireland enacted a ban on all crypto donations to political entities, aiming to protect its democracy from foreign interference while also tackling misinformation and transparency issues. In the United States, several states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have banned crypto donations to political campaigns due to similar concerns, despite the growing popularity of digital assets in campaign fundraising. El Salvador, which has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, does not ban crypto donations, although civic groups there have warned about the potential for anonymous foreign or criminal influence in its elections. As crypto donations continue to rise globally , lawmakers face the challenge of closing regulatory gaps while balancing innovation with the need to protect democratic systems from opaque and potentially harmful financial influences.

2025-07-17T10:52:23,"Ripple’s XRP Failed in January: Can It Succeed in July?","TL;DR There’s something in the cryptocurrency air in the past week or so, as bitcoin broke out of consolidation, marched to a new all-time high, and brought the entire market with it. Ripple’s cross-border token is among the biggest beneficiaries of this rally, having surged to well beyond $3 and close to its all-time high of $3.4. But can it finally do it now? The Rise Just look at the graph above, which paints a vivid picture of XRP’s massive run experienced lately. The asset had fallen below $2 at the end of June (not that long ago, right?) during the darkest hours of the Israel-Iran conflict. However, it quickly bounced above it and returned to a familiar ground of $2.2-$2.3, which was a tight range in which it spent most of the past few months. Fast-forward to last Wednesday, the landscape was relatively uneventful and, some might say, boring, as XRP was rangebound within this consolidation phase, with little to no indication of a clear breakout, despite some big predictions . However, the cryptocurrency market was revived as mentioned above, led by BTC’s massive $15,000 surge to a new all-time high of over $123,000. Not only did XRP follow suit, but it managed to dwarf bitcoin’s impressive gains. The largest cryptocurrency is up by 6.7% weekly, while the third-biggest has shot up by 33%. Earlier today, the asset jumped to $3.25, thus coming around 4.5% away from its January 2018 peak of $3.4 (CoinGecko data). To put things into perspective, XRP has gained over 70% since the aforementioned bottom in June (less than a month ago). Can There Be New ATH? Although impressive, this run has not been an isolated incident for XRP. Recall that the cryptocurrency rallied hard in late 2024 and early 2025, and its culmination came in January when it matched its all-time high of $3.4. However, it couldn’t keep climbing into uncharted territory despite the community’s expectations. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about the current environment and its opinion on XRP’s chances for a new record now. The AI solution noted that even though Ripple’s native token is so close to its ATH, a breach above it is not as easy and simple as some might think. This is because the $3.4 level has become a “psychological and technical ceiling for over seven years.” “XRP was rejected there in January, indicating it’s a sticky level.” On the contrary, ChatGPT listed a few favorable indicators that could propel the asset to and beyond that level. The RSI is still below 70, which means it “may still have room to move up.” Additionally, there are lots of bullish factors outside of technical analysis, such as ETF momentum , ISO 20022 update narrative, and overall market sentiment, that could lead to new peaks. If it indeed manages to break through, analysts are adamant that the next target will be around $4.80.

One analyst is expecting blood on the Satoshi Street once the GENIUS Act becomes the law. In this context, crypto analyst Jacob King sounded the alarm over what he calls the “bloodiest event in Bitcoin’s modern history.” His warning centers on the potential banning of Tether (USDT) following the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, which he claims could trigger a massive collapse across the crypto market. Bitcoin is on the brink of its bloodiest event in modern history and no one is talking about it. Tether is about to be BANNED once the GENIUS Act passes the Senate. Why do you think they’ve been desperately printing USDT out of thin air, pumping prices to unsustainable all-time… — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) July 16, 2025 Tether in the Crosshairs? According to analysts, the GENIUS Act, which is gaining traction in Congress, could effectively lead to a ban on Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap. Despite the ban fear, Tether has recently minted 160 billion USDT, marking a major milestone and reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market. He argues that this threat is why Tether has been “desperately printing USDT out of thin air” in recent weeks to artificially inflate crypto prices, including Bitcoin’s. Tether has long faced criticism for its lack of transparency and allegations of unbacked printing, though it has continued to deny wrongdoing. Institutional Outflows Signal Trouble King also points to a wave of record ETF outflows this week, stating that institutions are quietly exiting their Bitcoin positions. He sees this as a major red flag, suggesting that “whales are abandoning the sinking ship” while retail investors remain unaware of the looming risk. Tether Insiders Dumping Bitcoin? In a further claim, King says that Tether insiders are offloading record amounts of Bitcoin through OTC (over-the-counter) trades, distancing themselves from the fallout before it begins. If true, this could mean major players are shedding risk while keeping the market unaware of the scale of exits. A Structural Collapse? King’s core argument is that Tether is the foundation propping up Bitcoin. He estimates that 85–90% of BTC’s daily volume is dependent on USDT, which he calls “fake volume.” Without Tether, he warns, “people will realize how fake everything has been.” In his view, the crypto market is built on fragile ground, and the removal of Tether could expose the entire system to collapse. While King’s post paints a bleak scenario, it’s important to note that his views are controversial and not supported by hard evidence in this thread. Still, his warning is sparking serious debate about stablecoin regulation and the real liquidity behind crypto markets, issues that could come into sharper focus as U.S. lawmakers push forward with crypto legislation. How True is this? While the warning highlights crypto’s volatility, it also opens the door for new players like Ripple’s RLUSD to gain ground. The GENIUS Act doesn’t ban Tether outright but gives it 18–36 months to comply. Contrary to panic, ETF data shows inflows, not outflows. Overall, the market remains shaky, but there’s no clear sign of an imminent “bloodbath.”",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/tether-in-trouble-as-genius-act-targets-usdt-is-a-market-collapse-ahead/,"USDT|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T10:50:28,"Bitcoin Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious 40x Short Position Sparks Market Buzz","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious 40x Short Position Sparks Market Buzz In the high-stakes world of Bitcoin trading , where fortunes can be made and lost in moments, a prominent move by Hyperliquid trader James Wynn has captured the attention of the crypto community. Known for his aggressive yet calculated strategies, Wynn recently closed a highly profitable long position on Bitcoin (BTC) and immediately pivoted, opening an audacious 40x crypto short position . This bold maneuver has ignited discussions across social media and trading desks, raising questions about market sentiment and the inherent risks and rewards of extreme leveraged trading . The Genesis of a Bold Move: James Wynn’s Profit and Pivot The saga began with James Wynn successfully concluding a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, a trade that culminated in a remarkable profit of $368,120. This significant gain, as reported by Onchain Lens on X, underscores Wynn’s prowess in navigating volatile crypto markets. What makes his latest move particularly compelling is the immediate shift from a bullish stance to an aggressively bearish one. After securing his profits, Wynn wasted no time in establishing a new 40x BTC short position, signaling a strong conviction about Bitcoin’s immediate future trajectory. This rapid pivot from long to short, especially with such high leverage, is a testament to the dynamic nature of crypto markets and the decisive actions some traders take. It’s not just about making a profit; it’s about anticipating market shifts and positioning oneself accordingly, even if it means going against the prevailing sentiment. Understanding Leveraged Trading: Amplifying Gains and Risks Wynn’s 40x position highlights the powerful, yet perilous, nature of leveraged trading . But what exactly does ’40x leverage’ mean, and why is it such a talked-about topic in the crypto space? What is Leveraged Trading? Leveraged trading allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital. Essentially, you borrow funds from an exchange to amplify your potential returns. A 40x leverage means that for every $1 of your own capital, you can control $40 worth of an asset. While this can significantly boost profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. The Mechanics of Leverage: Margin: The initial capital you put up to open a leveraged position. Borrowed Funds: The additional capital provided by the exchange. Liquidation Price: A critical price point where your position is automatically closed by the exchange if the market moves too far against you, to prevent your losses from exceeding your margin. The higher the leverage, the closer your liquidation price is to your entry price. For a 40x position, even a small percentage move against the trader can lead to liquidation. This is why such high leverage is often considered extremely risky and is typically employed by experienced traders with robust risk management strategies. Why a Crypto Short Position? Deciphering Wynn’s Bearish Bet The decision by James Wynn to open a crypto short position on Bitcoin at 40x leverage speaks volumes about his current market outlook. Short selling, in essence, is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. Traders ‘short’ an asset by borrowing it, selling it at the current market price, and then hoping to buy it back later at a lower price to return it to the lender, profiting from the price difference. Reasons for Short Selling Bitcoin: Bearish Market Outlook: The most direct reason is a belief that Bitcoin’s price is due for a correction or a significant decline. Hedging: Traders might short BTC to offset potential losses in their long-term spot holdings during a market downturn. Profit from Volatility: In highly volatile markets like crypto, short selling provides an opportunity to profit from downward price movements, complementing strategies focused on upward trends. Wynn’s immediate pivot to a short position suggests he anticipates a significant downturn, or at least a temporary dip, that he believes will be substantial enough to yield considerable profit even after accounting for funding rates and trading fees associated with high leverage. Hyperliquid: The Arena for High-Stakes Trading The platform of choice for James Wynn ‘s high-leverage maneuvers is Hyperliquid . Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity, low fees, and ability to offer substantial leverage to its users. Being a decentralized platform, it appeals to traders seeking more autonomy and potentially lower counterparty risk compared to centralized exchanges. The choice of Hyperliquid underscores the growing trend of sophisticated traders utilizing DeFi platforms for advanced trading strategies. These platforms often provide the infrastructure necessary for rapid execution and high leverage, catering to a niche of experienced and aggressive traders. What are the Implications and Risks of Such a Trade? A 40x crypto short position is not for the faint of heart. While the potential for amplified profits is immense, so too is the risk of catastrophic loss. This trade by James Wynn carries several implications and inherent risks: Potential Implications: Market Signal: A high-profile trader like Wynn taking such a significant short position could influence market sentiment, potentially leading other traders to re-evaluate their long positions or consider shorting themselves. Increased Volatility: Large leveraged positions, if they get liquidated, can create cascading effects, contributing to market volatility. Test of Conviction: This trade is a strong test of Wynn’s conviction in his bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Inherent Risks: Rapid Liquidation: With 40x leverage, even a small upward price movement in Bitcoin could lead to the entire position being liquidated, resulting in a complete loss of the margin. Funding Rates: Holding perpetual short positions often incurs funding fees, which can eat into profits or exacerbate losses if the position is held for an extended period. Unpredictable Market: The crypto market is notoriously unpredictable, and unexpected positive news or institutional inflows could rapidly invalidate a bearish thesis. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust risk management in Bitcoin trading , especially when employing high leverage. Actionable Insights for Aspiring Crypto Traders While James Wynn ‘s audacious trade might inspire some, it also offers valuable lessons for anyone engaging in Bitcoin trading , particularly those considering leveraged trading : 1. Master Risk Management: Stop-Loss Orders: Always set clear stop-loss levels to limit potential losses. Position Sizing: Never allocate more capital than you can afford to lose, especially with high leverage. Diversification: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged trade. 2. Understand Market Dynamics: Technical Analysis: Learn to read charts and identify trends. Fundamental Analysis: Stay informed about macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and project developments that could impact prices. 3. Start Small and Learn: Before attempting high-leverage trades like Wynn’s, practice with smaller amounts or on demo accounts. Understand the intricacies of platforms like Hyperliquid and the specific instruments you are trading. 4. Emotional Discipline: High-leverage trading is emotionally taxing. Stick to your trading plan, avoid impulsive decisions, and do not let fear or greed dictate your actions. 5. Continuous Learning: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Stay updated with new strategies, tools, and market insights. Learning from experienced traders like Wynn, not just their wins but also their rationale, can be incredibly valuable. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Bet in a Volatile Market James Wynn ‘s decision to open a 40x crypto short position on Bitcoin immediately after a significant profit from a long position is a classic example of high-conviction trading in the crypto world. It underscores the immense opportunities and equally immense risks associated with leveraged trading , particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid . While Wynn’s move signals a bearish sentiment, the ultimate outcome remains to be seen in the notoriously unpredictable Bitcoin trading landscape. For the broader crypto community, it serves as a powerful reminder of the volatility and the need for meticulous strategy and stringent risk management for anyone daring enough to venture into the high-leverage arena. Whether this audacious bet pays off for Wynn will be a closely watched development in the coming days.

But what does this mean for you, and how can this index guide your journey in the dynamic world of digital assets? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool designed to capture the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity for the brave. 25-49: Fear – General anxiety in the market, but not panic. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a market correction might be on the horizon. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite built from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive snapshot of crypto market sentiment : Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes current volume and market momentum compared to average values. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter hashtags and mentions for crypto-related terms. Surveys 15% Weekly polls, though currently paused. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries for crypto-related terms. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 74 Mean for Crypto? A score of 74 puts the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This indicates that investors are feeling confident, perhaps even euphoric, about current price trends and future prospects. Such a high reading suggests that recent positive price action, coupled with optimistic news or developments, has likely fueled this upward shift in sentiment. When market momentum is strong, as it appears to be now, it often encourages more participants to enter or increase their positions, hoping to capitalize on further gains. While ‘Greed’ can be a powerful driver of price increases, it’s also a double-edged sword. Historically, periods of extreme greed have sometimes preceded market corrections. It’s a classic example of investor psychology at play: when everyone is optimistic, there’s less room for new buyers, and the market can become overextended. This is why understanding the index isn’t just about celebrating highs, but also about recognizing potential risks. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Other Key Factors The Bitcoin dominance factor plays a crucial, albeit smaller, role in the index’s calculation. Bitcoin’s market share often reflects overall market stability and investor preference for the leading cryptocurrency. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety within crypto, or simply that Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins, influencing overall sentiment. While not the largest component, it provides insight into how capital is distributed across the crypto ecosystem. Beyond Bitcoin dominance and market momentum, the contributions from volatility, social media, and Google Trends paint a broader picture. High volatility can signal uncertainty, but if accompanied by strong positive price action, it might also reflect excitement. Social media buzz and increased Google searches for crypto terms often correlate with rising public interest and participation, further feeding into the ‘Greed’ sentiment. Navigating Investor Psychology: Leveraging the Index for Informed Decisions Understanding investor psychology is paramount in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a unique lens through which to view collective market emotions. For savvy investors, this index can be a powerful contrarian indicator: When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24): This might be a prime time to consider accumulating assets, as prices could be undervalued due to widespread panic. As the saying goes, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” When the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100): This could be a signal to exercise caution, take some profits, or re-evaluate your portfolio’s risk exposure, as the market may be overheated. While the index is a valuable sentiment tool, it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions. Combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. It’s a guide, not a guarantee. Conclusion: What’s Next for Crypto Sentiment? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 signifies a robust period of optimism and increasing participation within the cryptocurrency space. This ‘Greed’ zone reflects a positive shift in crypto market sentiment , driven by factors like strong market momentum and an evolving landscape of Bitcoin dominance . As we’ve explored, while a high index reading can be exciting, it also prompts a thoughtful consideration of investor psychology and potential market dynamics. By understanding and wisely utilizing tools like this index, investors can make more informed decisions, navigate market fluctuations with greater confidence, and potentially capitalize on opportunities while managing risks effectively. The journey of cryptocurrency continues to be fascinating, and staying attuned to its emotional pulse is key.

You Might Own a Piece of Everything, Says Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Can a tiny slice of Bitcoin give you a share in the world’s wealth forever? Crypto analyst and author of “The Bitcoin Thesis”, Cole Walmsley , says yes. In a widely shared tweet, Walmsley calls Bitcoin “the greatest asymmetric opportunity in human history,” arguing that even 0.01 BTC, worth about $1,195 today, could be enough to secure your long-term stake in a world that’s shifting toward a Bitcoin standard. The Big Idea: A World Priced in Bitcoin Walmsley describes what he calls a coming “monetary singularity”, which is a future where everything, from goods and services to land and technology, is priced in Bitcoin . He says Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million means that owning any amount of it today locks in a permanent share of global value. “With 0.01 BTC in your possession, you own 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists,” he writes. “Not just today, but forever.” With 0.01 BTC in your possession, you own 1/2,100,000,000 of all BTC, and you own 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists. The craziest part is that it’s not only everything that exists today, it’s 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists *forever.* — Cole Walmsley (@Cole_Walmsley) July 16, 2025 Here’s the Math Behind the Claim Walmsley points to an estimated $1 quadrillion in total global value. If all of it were eventually priced in BTC, your 0.01 BTC stake would equal roughly $476,190. That’s a potential upside of nearly 400x from today’s price. And that’s just based on existing global wealth, not including future growth ! So Why Is It “Asymmetric”? The core of Walmsley’s argument is simple: Bitcoin has limited downside and unlimited upside. Your potential loss is the money you invest. Your potential gain? He argues it could be infinite if Bitcoin becomes the base layer of global money. “With Bitcoin, your downside is whatever money you put into it. Your upside is infinity,” he says. Walmsley urges people to buy at least a “little” Bitcoin, just in case it works out. You could have nothing to lose and everything to gain.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/hold-0-01-bitcoin-you-might-own-a-piece-of-everything-says-analyst/,"BTC|ZRX|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T10:17:20,"Ethereum Hits 152M Active Wallets, Gains 50% in 4 Weeks","Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing quite a resurgence, hitting key milestones and igniting market enthusiasm. According to analytics firm Santiment, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has surged over 50% in less than four weeks, reclaiming heights last seen in late January while boasting a record-breaking 152.03 million non-empty wallets, the most extensive active user base in crypto. Institutional Inflows, Social Buzz Fuel Ethereum Breakout The Santiment data shows that since June 22, ETH’s market value has grown by more than 50%, pushing its price above $3,400 for the first time in six months. Ethereum’s market value has now grown by +50% since June 22nd, hitting its highest price levels since late January. The network has over 152.03M non-empty $ETH wallets, more than any other coin in cryptocurrency. ️ Additionally, the crowd has taken note of the major price… pic.twitter.com/XJoV6THMBY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 16, 2025 The dramatic rebound has understandably caught the crypto community’s eye, triggering the highest level of social media discussions since May 2024. Numbers from the market intelligence platform show that ETH was the top trending crypto asset in the last 24 hours across X, Reddit, and Telegram, with conversations around it predominantly characterized by bullish sentiment as users set their sights on $4,000. “The crowd has taken note of the major price rebound, pouring in the highest level of discussions since a similar price rise back in May 2024,” said Santiment. This uptick seems to have been fueled by a combination of institutional accumulation and renewed investor enthusiasm following Bitcoin’s recent run to a new all-time high. On July 16, spot Ethereum ETFs shattered records, attracting more than $726 million in net investments. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge, registering its highest single-day inflow since launch with a $489 million haul. With Fidelity and Grayscale also reporting substantial capital entries, corporate holdings of the asset have swelled to 1.6 million ETH, valued at an estimated $5.3 billion. As noted by the Strategic Eth Reserve, accumulation is now occurring 36 times faster than new ETH issuance. Market Outlook Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency rose 10% to trade around $3,450 per data from CoinGecko. In the past seven days, its value increased by 25%, vastly outperforming Bitcoin’s 6.8% growth in the same period. More notably, SwissBlock’s recent Altcoin Vector report hinted at ETH’s growing magnetism for liquidity after noting a steady rise in the ETH/BTC ratio. The report suggests that Ethereum is now the cycle’s next leg after BTC briefly retreated to under $116,000 yesterday before bouncing back close to $119,000. The milestone of 152.03 million non-empty wallets, highlighted by Santiment, is viewed by watchers as a sign of the network’s expanding user base and fundamental health. According to the analytics platform, the mass fear of missing out (FOMO) has now shifted to ETH, with many expecting its price to hit $4,000 imminently. Others, like on-chain analyst AbramChart, suggest that the asset will fly to new all-time highs past $5,200 if BTC’s dominance decreases.

2025-07-17T10:14:45,"Trusted UK Agent Caught Stealing Over 50 BTC from Seized Funds","The post Trusted UK Agent Caught Stealing Over 50 BTC from Seized Funds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The rot starts from the head.” This age-old proverb rings true in a shocking case from the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), where a former officer, Paul Chowles , was convicted of stealing a significant number of Bitcoins seized during the Silk Road 2.0 investigation. Chowles’ Role in the Infamous Silk Road 2.0 Case The Silk Road 2.0 was a notorious dark web marketplace taken down by the FBI in 2014. It had served as a successor to the original Silk Road, facilitating illegal drug sales, money laundering, and other criminal activities. One of its co-founders, Thomas White, was arrested and later sentenced to over five years in prison for a range of charges, including drug trafficking, laundering proceeds of crime, and even possessing child abuse material. As part of the investigation, at least 97 BTC were confiscated from White’s digital wallets. Chowles, then an NCA officer, was actively involved in data recovery and analysis from the seized devices. But rather than upholding the law, he ultimately chose to abuse his access. The Insider Theft That Shocked the Agency In 2017, the NCA identified that more than 50 BTC had quietly disappeared from the seized stash. Initially, investigators suspected White himself, but after strong denial from his side, attention turned inward. What followed was an internal probe that uncovered corruption in their ranks. During searches of Chowles’ properties, authorities discovered a mobile phone linked to the wallet where the stolen Bitcoin was sent. Notebooks containing crypto wallet passwords and login details were also found. His search history revealed he had been looking up information about using crypto exchanges . Investigators also learned that Chowles had used a crypto mixer called Bitcoin Fog — a service commonly used to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions. Analysis by Chainalysis revealed that some of the stolen BTC was later liquidated using crypto debit cards and crypto exchanges. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Four Global Crypto Exchanges Listed in Q2 2025 , From Crimefighter to Convict: The Sentencing Eventually, Chowles admitted guilt and pleaded guilty to charges of theft, transferring criminal property, and concealing criminal property. His betrayal earned him a 5.5-year prison sentence. Prosecutor Alex Johnson of the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that asset confiscation proceedings would now follow to recover the stolen funds. The scale of Chowles’ theft was staggering. Reports state he spent approximately $146,580 using crypto debit cards, and his total illegal benefit was estimated at $821,345. At today’s Bitcoin price of $118,258, the seized funds are now worth far more than they were in 2014, adding to the severity of the breach. This case not only exposed a deep failure in oversight but also delivered a message: corruption can exist even among those appointed to root it out. And in the crypto space, where traceability meets complexity, even an insider’s mistake leaves a trail. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just announced a postponement of its decision regarding a significant aspect of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF: the allowance of ‘in-kind redemptions.’ This delay, reported by Decrypt based on a July 16 filing, keeps investors and market participants on the edge of their seats, wondering about the future trajectory of these highly anticipated investment vehicles. What does this mean for the burgeoning SEC Bitcoin ETF landscape and the broader digital asset market? What Does the SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay Mean for Investors? For those closely following the evolution of cryptocurrency investments, the recent move by the SEC is a familiar one – a delay, not a denial. The proposed rule change, which was submitted by NYSE Arca on May 21, aims to enable in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. While the initial approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental step, most currently operate under a ‘cash redemption’ model. The SEC’s decision to push back on the in-kind redemption model for the Bitwise ETFs signals a continued cautious approach to integrating digital assets into traditional finance. This delay extends the review period, giving the regulatory body more time to deliberate on the complexities and potential implications of such a mechanism. For investors, it means that while the dream of a more efficient and potentially tax-friendly redemption process for these ETFs remains alive, its realization is still some way off. The market is now keenly watching for the SEC’s next move, understanding that each decision shapes the accessibility and operational dynamics of crypto-based financial products. Unpacking In-kind Redemptions: Why the SEC is Hesitant At the heart of the SEC’s deliberation lies the concept of In-kind Redemptions . But what exactly are they, and why are they such a focal point for regulators and issuers alike? What are In-kind Redemptions? In an in-kind redemption model, authorized participants (APs) exchange shares of an ETF directly for the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than cash. Conversely, for creation, APs would deliver BTC or ETH to the fund in exchange for new ETF shares. Benefits for Investors and Issuers: This method is generally considered more tax-efficient because it avoids the need for the fund to sell assets and incur capital gains, which could then be passed on to shareholders. It can also be more efficient for market makers, potentially leading to tighter spreads and lower costs for investors. SEC’s Concerns: The primary reason for the SEC’s hesitation revolves around investor protection and market integrity. Regulators are wary of potential market manipulation, custody risks associated with holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies, and ensuring robust oversight mechanisms are in place. The direct handling of crypto assets by APs, rather than cash equivalents, introduces new layers of complexity and risk that the SEC is meticulously evaluating. The current spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, operate on a cash redemption model, where APs transact in cash to create or redeem shares. While functional, many in the industry believe in-kind redemptions offer a superior structure, aligning more closely with how traditional commodity and equity ETFs operate. The SEC’s extended review period for Bitwise underscores their deep dive into these nuanced operational differences and their potential systemic impact. The Broader Impact on Ethereum ETF and the Crypto Market While the immediate focus is on Bitwise’s specific filings, the SEC’s approach to in-kind redemptions has far-reaching implications, particularly for the anticipated Ethereum ETF landscape. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is still pending, and the SEC’s cautious stance on redemption mechanisms for Bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly influence its decisions for Ether-based products. If the SEC eventually approves in-kind redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, it could set a precedent that smooths the path for similar structures in Ethereum ETFs. Conversely, continued delays or outright rejections could mean that all future spot crypto ETFs, including those for Ethereum, might be restricted to cash redemption models for the foreseeable future. This regulatory uncertainty can impact: Institutional Adoption: A more streamlined and tax-efficient in-kind redemption process could attract more institutional capital into the crypto space. Delays might deter some traditional finance players. Market Liquidity: In-kind redemptions can theoretically improve market liquidity by allowing APs to manage arbitrage opportunities more efficiently, directly interacting with the underlying crypto markets. Investor Confidence: Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks build investor confidence. Protracted delays, while understandable from a regulatory perspective, can sometimes foster uncertainty. The broader Crypto ETF market is still in its nascent stages, and every regulatory decision, no matter how small it seems, contributes to shaping its long-term structure and growth potential. This specific delay highlights the SEC’s commitment to a methodical, albeit slow, integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Bitwise’s Position: A Pioneer in the Crypto ETF Race Bitwise has consistently been at the forefront of bringing digital asset investment products to market. They were among the first to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF and have been vocal proponents of more efficient and investor-friendly structures, including in-kind redemptions. Their proactive approach demonstrates a commitment to innovation within the regulatory boundaries. For Bitwise, this delay means a continuation of the waiting game. While they already have an operational spot Bitcoin ETF utilizing cash redemptions, securing approval for in-kind redemptions would offer them a competitive edge and potentially reduce operational complexities and costs. Their continued engagement with the SEC highlights the industry’s persistent efforts to refine and optimize crypto investment vehicles. This isn’t just about one company; it’s about pushing the entire industry forward towards more mature and integrated financial products. Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities in the Crypto ETF Landscape The journey to fully integrated crypto ETFs is fraught with challenges, but also ripe with opportunities. The SEC’s delay on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF underscores the regulatory hurdles that remain. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection and market integrity, leading to intense scrutiny of novel asset classes and redemption mechanisms. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies presents unique challenges for fund management and risk assessment. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount, and the regulatory framework around this is still evolving. Opportunities: Maturing Market: Each regulatory step, even a delayed one, contributes to the maturation and legitimization of the crypto market. Increased Access: ETFs provide an accessible entry point for traditional investors who may be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Innovation: The ongoing dialogue between issuers and regulators fosters innovation in product design and operational efficiency, pushing the boundaries of financial technology. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Spot Crypto ETFs? The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise ETFs will undoubtedly set a precedent for future spot Crypto ETF products. While a definitive timeline remains elusive, market participants anticipate further engagement between issuers and the regulatory body. It is plausible that the SEC may request more information, propose specific conditions, or even hold public forums to gather diverse perspectives before making a final determination. The path forward for crypto ETFs, particularly those seeking more advanced operational structures like in-kind redemptions, will likely involve continued adaptation and collaboration between innovators and regulators. The ultimate goal for many is a seamless integration of digital assets into the broader financial ecosystem, offering investors diverse, regulated, and efficient avenues to gain exposure to this transformative asset class. Conclusion: Patience is a Virtue in the Crypto ETF Journey The SEC’s postponement of its decision on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs serves as a reminder that the journey of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial products is a marathon, not a sprint. While the delay might be frustrating for some, it underscores the regulatory body’s commitment to a thorough and cautious approach, prioritizing investor protection and market stability above all else. The debate around In-kind Redemptions highlights critical operational and tax efficiency considerations that could significantly shape the future of these investment vehicles. As the industry continues to mature and regulatory clarity slowly emerges, patience remains a virtue for investors and innovators alike, eagerly awaiting the next chapter in the evolving story of SEC Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products.

Twitter Is Buzzing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has stirred up the crypto crowd once again, this time with a simple laughing emoji. His reaction came after a playful post on X, where a user offered $200 to Grok, Musk’s AI chatbot, to crack open the Bitcoin wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto. That single emoji was enough to send speculation swirling. Grok says, “Challenge Accepted “ In response to the post, Grok accepted the challenge, though with a heavy dose of sarcasm. It pointed out that trying to brute-force a 256-bit private key is practically impossible, even with all the GPUs in the world. As for the $200 tip? Grok joked it was “decent,” but nowhere near enough for a task that involves immense randomness and technical complexity. Still, Musk’s reaction, paired with Grok’s response, has sparked fresh talk about Musk’s links to crypto and the identity of Bitcoin’s elusive creator. Could Satoshi Become Richer Than Musk? Elon Musk has an estimated net worth of $366B. With Bitcoin hovers at $118,400 and taking Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.029 million BTC into account, his current net worth is estimated at $129 billion. To dethrone Musk, BTC price/coin must cross $335,925 mark. Nakamoto now trails behind tech giant Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($257 billion) and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg ($247 billion). As Bitcoin’s value skyrockets, some wonder if Satoshi could take over Musk as the world’s richest person. Is Musk Actually Satoshi? That Theory Still Lives Musk’s experience in cryptography and co-founding X.com, which later became PayPal, has long fueled speculation that he could be Satoshi. A former SpaceX intern even pointed to resemblances between Musk’s and Satoshi’s writings. Musk stated, “ Not true ,” and dismissed all the speculation back in 2017. Nevertheless, his funny interaction with Bitcoin-related subjects backs speculation. Final Take Elon Musk’s playful reaction to the Satoshi wallet joke may seem harmless but in the crypto world, even a simple emoji can spark headlines. As Bitcoin’s price keeps rising, the idea that its anonymous creator could one day surpass Musk in wealth is fueling even more curiosity. For now, Musk’s humor keeps the mystery going and the crypto community watching closely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-musks-grok-crack-satoshis-bitcoin-wallet-twitter-is-buzzing/,"BTC|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T10:00:40,"Crypto Evasion Crackdown: EU Sanctions Entities For Disinformation, Election Interference","The European Union (EU) has imposed restrictive measures on several individuals and companies that interfered with elections and spread pro-Russia disinformation. The entities have reportedly used crypto to circumvent sanctions and accept donations. Australian Influencer Sanctioned For Misinformation On Tuesday, the European Union announced it had imposed sanctions on multiple entities and individuals using cryptocurrencies to evade restrictions, spread pro-Russia misinformation, and interfere with elections. The EU sanctioned nine individuals and six entities, including pro-Kremlin Australian influencer Simeon Boikov, also known as “AussieCossack,” for disinformation. Boikov was reportedly involved in supporting policies of the Russian federal government that “undermine or threaten democracy, the rule of law, stability or security in the Union or in third countries.” Notably, the influencer has allegedly planned , directed, engaged in, supported, and facilitated the use of coordinated information manipulation and interference, including propagating pro-Kremlin narratives and misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, he was “implicated in spreading disinformation related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, notably by paying an American influencer to post a Storm-1516 fabricated video falsely depicting voter fraud in Georgia.” According to blockchain intelligence company TMR Labs, Boikov raised cash and crypto donations through multiple online channels. He has reportedly engaged directly with multiple high-risk, no-KYC (know-your-client) Russian exchanges, receiving funds via cash-to-crypto services and darknet markets, which were routed through intermediary addresses. EU Targets Crypto-Linked Sanction Evasion The EU also imposed restrictive measures against seven individuals and three entities for their actions aimed at “destabilising, undermining or threatening” the sovereignty, independence, democracy, rule of law, and stability of the Republic of Moldova. The measure targets Ilan Shor’s associates, including leaders and members of successor entities of the banned ȘOR Party, a Moldovan pro-Russian populist political party founded by Shor that was declared unconstitutional in 2023. Notably, Shor has already been designated by the EU due to his “involvement in illegal financing of political parties in the Republic of Moldova and for incitement to violence.” Among the listed entities, the European Council also designated A7, a company founded by Shor and previously listed by the United Kingdom. The company has multiple ties to the Russian government and has been accused of influencing Moldova’s Presidential elections and the 2024 Constitutional referendum on EU accession. AS TMR explained, A7 was conceived as a mechanism to facilitate cross-border trades due to the sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. The company is linked to the ruble-backed stablecoin A7A5, which was used by sanctioned crypto exchange Garantex to transfer funds to Kyrgyz exchange Grinex. A7A5 and Grinex both have been identified by TRM Labs as being part of a new nexus of Kyrgyzstan-registered entities with cryptocurrency connections to sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, and are also likely tied to the import of dual-use goods from China to Russia through Central Asia. It’s worth noting that Russian companies started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in international trade to bypass sanctions. As reported by Bitcoinist, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed in December that companies had started officially using BTC and other cryptocurrencies for international payments following last year’s regulatory changes. Siluanov affirmed that international payments in crypto represented the future of finance, adding that the government believes “they should be expanded and developed further.” In April, he announced a plan to establish a dedicated exchange for “highly qualified investors” alongside the Bank of Russia (BOR), aiming to “legalize crypto assets and bring crypto operations out of the shadows.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-evasion-crackdown-eu-sanctions-entities-for-disinformation-election-interference/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM","Crypto News|A7A5 stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto donations|crypto exchange|Crypto Sanctions|EU sanctions|European union sanctions|Garantex|Russia crypto exchange|Russia sanctions|Russian authorities",cryptocompare

The Bank of Thailand and Thai Securities & Exchange Commission have joined forces to make the program a reality. According to a local outlet, the initiative aims to modernize how international tourists interact with the local economy. According to Gulf Biance CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul: This crypto sandbox builds directly upon former premier Thaksin Shinawatra’s Phuket sandbox from late last year. Both share the core concept of allowing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as payment methods in tourist areas to drive adoption. The new sandbox proposal is no longer just limited to Phuket, but applies nationwide. Bangkok Post @BangkokPostNews · Follow Digital asset exchange operators have welcomed a joint effort between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand to launch a crypto sandbox to allow foreign tourists to use digital assets in Thailand, saying the new initiative would drive crypto 3:08 pm · 17 Jul 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies Meanwhile, the move establishes Thailand among the first countries in the Asia-Pacific region to merge crypto adoption with the tourism sector. The new sandbox will operate in a monitored environment, with certified providers offering financial services that allow travelers to exchange crypto for baht and spend seamlessly. Converting crypto into baht securely and legally The new initiative enables visitors holding tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to turn their digital holdings into the local baht through licensed service providers. That includes exchanges that operate under the oversight of the Thailand Securities & Exchange Commission. That reflects Thailand’s forward-thinking approach to encourage monetary innovation without sacrificing user safety and AML protocols. The Thai SEC threatened to restrict five trading platforms , including OKX and Bybit, for offering unlicensed services. Travelers will have their converted funds deposited into government-certified electronic wallets. They can then pay for anything across the country, whether shopping in Bangkok malls, paying for spas in Phuket, or purchasing street food in Bang Rak. The goal is to ensure that cryptocurrency holders, tech-savvy tourists, and digital nomads enjoy financial freedom in Thailand without dealing with traditional currency exchanges. A win for Thailand’s economy and tourists Thailand has long been the favorite country for global tourists due to its diverse attraction sites, including delicious food, beautiful beaches, affordable travel options, and rich culture. Moreover, it’s among the nations with great interest in cryptocurrencies. Thailand approved a capital gains tax exemption on legal crypto trading last month. The launched crypto sandbox will likely boost the country’s appeal. Tourists will enjoy more spending power, especially those who prefer holding cryptocurrencies over fiat. Further, it helps the Thai government better track finances for tax clarity, a challenging factor when tourists use unrecognized currency exchanges.

2025-07-17T09:58:43,"Senator Lummis Calls Alleged US Bitcoin Dump a “Strategic Blunder”","Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis reacts to reports that the United States government has sold more than 80% of its Bitcoin stash, referring to the move as a strategic blunder. Yesterday, the crypto community was stirred by reports claiming that the U.S. government had offloaded a significant portion of its nearly 200,000 BTC stash. Some sources stated that the sale had reduced the government’s Bitcoin holdings to just 28,988 BTC, an 85% drop from the 198,012 BTC it held earlier this year.Senator Lummis ReactsFor context, the reports emerged after a FOIA response from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) surfaced online, suggesting that the agency held roughly 29,000 BTC.The USMS is responsible for managing and auctioning off seized cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, in the United States. As such, the news that it holds only 29K BTC alarmed the crypto industry.Notably, Senator Lummis reacted to the report via a post on X, expressing shock that the government may have sold off 80% of its Bitcoin holdings. She stated that if the reports were accurate, then the government had made a total strategic blunder. In her view, such a move may set the U.S. several years backward in the global Bitcoin race.https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1945578868665917535US Government Current Bitcoin HoldingsMeanwhile, the claims that the U.S. government has sold most of its Bitcoin holdings misinterpret the FOIA response.While the response indicated that USMS holds roughly 29,000 BTC, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows the U.S. government still has approximately 200,000 BTC. The government obtained these assets through criminal and civil forfeitures.Tracked public wallets indicate that the government still holds a total of 198,012 Bitcoin, currently worth $23.49 billion. The U.S. plans to retain them for several years, anticipating a future price increase and using the proceeds to help offset national debt..President Donald Trump outlined this strategy while signing an executive order earlier this year. He ordered the BTC tokens to be held in a strategic reserve.Interestingly, Trump intends to grow the U.S. Bitcoin stash over the years through budget-neutral ways. Per the order, the president directed the Commerce and Treasury departments to propose ways the government can acquire more BTC without incurring any costs to taxpayers.In the meantime, the government’s portfolio is currently worth $24.25 billion. It comprises multiple crypto assets, including 347 million USDT, 59,951 ETH ($202.14 million), 750 wBTC ($88.94 million), and 40,293 BNB ($28.7 million). US government crypto holdings US government crypto holdings Journalist Addresses Misrepresentation of FOIA ResponseHowever, Lola L33tz, the independent journalist who filed the FOIA request, addressed the public misinterpretation of the USMS response, particularly the reference to Arkham Intelligence data, which indicates that the U.S. government still holds roughly 200,000 BTC.Lola clarified the distinction between seized and forfeited crypto assets. She explained that seized assets are held by law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, following court-authorized actions. In contrast, forfeited assets have been legally declared government property, typically through judicial rulings or settlements.Essentially, the remaining Bitcoin is likely still under seizure but not yet forfeited, which explains why it is not in USMS custody or included in the FOIA disclosure. Notably, Lola emphasized that the USMS is the primary custodian of forfeited Bitcoin, not all government-held BTC. “This doesn't mean that the U.S. government has sold any Bitcoin,” Lola added. “It just means that whatever these U.S. Treasury sites estimate is likely wrong, as they don't seem to differentiate between seized and forfeited coins.”",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/17/senator-lummis-calls-alleged-us-bitcoin-dump-a-strategic-blunder/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=senator-lummis-calls-alleged-us-bitcoin-dump-a-strategic-blunder,"BTC|REGULATION|ARKM|MARKET|BNB","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-07-17T09:56:05,"Don’t Forget Shiba Inu, It Will Fly Soon: Analyst Highlights Path for a 130% SHIB Rally to $0.0000335","Amid a recent price rebound, a top analyst has predicted that Shiba Inu is on the cusp of a rally to levels last seen over a year ago. Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin by market cap, recently started to rebound after a period of price underperformance. For perspective, Shiba Inu dropped 69% from its high of $0.0000334 in December 2024 to a low of $0.00001004 in June, while Bitcoin reached multiple all-time highs within that timeframe.Currently, Shiba Inu is still down 31% from its opening price on January 1, but things seem to be changing quickly for the meme coin. Specifically, SHIB has rallied 17% in the past seven days and is up 6.2% over the past day, as it continues to cut down its losses.Shiba Inu Regaining MomentumAmid its building price momentum, analyst GehavianGoals has predicted that Shiba Inu will sustain the current bullish traction. He shared that Shiba Inu will “fly soon,” highlighting its possible price target and potential buy areas.An accompanying chart highlights that SHIB rebounded from a major resistance on the weekly chart, a potential catalyst for its recent momentum. The token has tested the demand zone multiple times this year and on one occasion last year, rejecting lower prices at each attempt. Shiba Inu Analysis GehavianGoals Shiba Inu Analysis | GehavianGoals For context, Shiba Inu rallied extensively from the support in early 2024, reaching a high of $0.00004567. However, it faced insurmountable resistance, which sparked a retracement to the same support on August 5, 2024.Meanwhile, Shiba Inu bounced from this support area to its December peak before facing another rejection. Since then, the memecoin has retested the $0.000011 support level four times, specifically on February 3, March 11, April 7, and most recently on June 22.Buy Areas as SHIB Set for Massive RallyNotably, the market watcher set his first buy area for the impending rally at $0.00001092, an area that Shiba Inu has since surpassed. Nonetheless, there is another buy opportunity at $0.0000188, which is about 31% away from its current price.For his target, he predicts a 130% rally from Shiba Inu’s current price to a 21-month high of $0.00003352. However, from his first entry at $0.00001092, it would amount to a 206% upsurge.The analyst did not provide a timeline for this rally but advised patience among holders. He revealed that he has been in a Shiba Inu trade for five months and would not mind holding for one to two years, as long as it reaches his target.Moreover, he joins a growing list of bulls calling for higher prices for Shiba Inu. For perspective, a recent analysis highlighted that SHIB will reclaim $0.000035 if it clears several major supply clusters.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/17/dont-forget-shiba-inu-it-will-fly-soon-analyst-highlights-path-for-a-130-shib-rally-to-0-0000335/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dont-forget-shiba-inu-it-will-fly-soon-analyst-highlights-path-for-a-130-shib-rally-to-0-0000335,"SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare
