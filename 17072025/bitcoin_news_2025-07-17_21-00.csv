2025-07-17T18:45:37,"Billion-Dollar Bank To Hand Out $510,000 To Settle Class Action Lawsuit Alleging Improper Charging of Overdraft Fees","A multi-billion-dollar bank is planning to shell out $510,000 to settle a class action lawsuit stemming from allegations that the financial institution hit customers with improper overdraft fees. Customers accuse Park National Bank of assessing allegedly improper Authorized Positive Purportedly Settled Negative (APPSN) fees between November 1st, 2016 and February 20th, 2025. An account that is initially authorized for a transaction but later has insufficient funds to process it and is overdrawn will receive APPSN fees, according to Law Insider . The Ohio-based Park National Bank, which U.S. Federal Reserve statistics indicate has more than $9.8 billion in consolidated assets, denies any wrongdoing or liability but opted to settle the case to avoid dealing with the cost of litigation. The bank agreed to create a settlement fund of $510,000, and it will also provide overdraft forgiveness as defined in the agreement. Of that settlement fund, up to $170,000 could go toward attorneys’ fees. The court will determine the amount of the attorneys’ fees and costs based on numerous factors, including risk, time and the outcome of the case. The court plans to hold a final approval hearing for the settlement on September 5th. If it is approved, payments should be made within two months of the effective date.

In its 2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update, Chainalysis says 2025’s losses have already surpassed the total losses from 2024. “With over $2.17 billion stolen from cryptocurrency services so far in 2025, this year is more devastating than the entirety of 2024. The DPRK’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea [North Korea]) $1.5 billion hack of ByBit, the largest single hack in crypto history, accounts for the majority of service losses.” Source: Chainalysis Currently, hackers have stolen 17% more than they had by this time in 2022, the worst year on record. If the scams stay on pace, crypto could see over $4 billion stolen by year’s end. While the ByBit breach set the record for the biggest heist ever, Chainalysis finds that more and more attacks are coming against individual user wallets. “Personal wallet compromises now represent a growing share of total ecosystem theft, with attackers increasingly targeting individual users, making up 23.35% of all stolen fund activity year-to-date in 2025.” Source: Chainalysis Even more telling — while previous crypto thefts have mostly occurred in the digital realm, more and more threats are turning to physical violence. “‘Wrench attacks’ — physical violence or coercion against crypto holders — show correlation with bitcoin price movements, suggesting opportunistic targeting during high-value periods.” Source: Chainalysis Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Market participants remain on alert as top analyst Darkfost reported a major development involving one of the oldest and most closely watched wallets in crypto history. According to the analyst, the remaining 40,000 BTC—valued at approximately $4.75 billion—still held by the 80K Satoshi-era whale have all moved. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive The shift began last night, signaling renewed activity from the early Bitcoin holder. Until now, only half of the whale’s holdings had been moved, while the rest remained dormant. This latest transfer marks the full mobilization of the entire 80,000 BTC once controlled by the entity. While the motive behind the move remains unknown, the market is watching closely for signs of potential selling or redistribution. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels despite this high-stakes movement may reflect strong demand and investor confidence. However, with $4.75 billion now in motion, traders are bracing for possible volatility ahead. The market is waiting to see if this event will trigger broader implications—or if it’s simply a strategic reshuffling from one of the ecosystem’s earliest whales. Satoshi-Era BTC Consolidates Into Single Address Darkfost highlighted a major on-chain development that has captured the market’s attention: Each of the four wallets, previously holding 10,000 BTC from the 80K whale, sent their funds to a single destination address bc1qs4nzm0je7wqfyfmqr4ht4upyzy57vc95nf4au0. This address now holds the entire $4.75 billion stash, raising new questions about the intent behind the move. According to Darkfost, while the pattern differs from previous sell-off precedents, the market must remain alert. “I guess these BTC might also end up hitting the market soon,” he commented. This kind of movement—especially from dormant, high-value wallets—often signals large-scale positioning, which can precede either institutional sales or strategic long-term storage. The timing coincides with rising bullish momentum across the crypto market. With Bitcoin consolidating above $118,000 following its $123,200 all-time high, traders are eyeing a potential breakout. Adding fuel to this outlook, all three key crypto-related bills were passed by the US House this week, removing significant regulatory uncertainty and clearing a path for broader adoption. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys $73M in Ethereum – Smart Money Loads the Dip Bitcoin Weekly Chart Signals Fresh Momentum The weekly chart shows Bitcoin holding strong above $118,000 after surging to an all-time high of $123,200. This breakout follows a prolonged consolidation just below the $110,000 resistance, which acted as a ceiling for several months. Now turned support, the $109,300 and $103,600 zones are critical demand levels, offering a firm foundation for continuation if bulls maintain control. The structure of the recent weekly candles reflects bullish dominance, characterized by strong bodies and relatively small upper wicks. This suggests controlled profit-taking and growing confidence from buyers. Meanwhile, volume is picking up, confirming participation in the breakout and hinting at the possibility of sustained momentum in the coming weeks.

As Bitcoin consolidates above former resistance, this zone may now serve as a launchpad for a move toward the next psychological target at $130,000.

2025-07-17T18:15:26,"Thailand introduces crypto sandbox project allowing tourists to spend baht","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) have come up with a strategic program, “crypto sandbox,” making it much easier for foreign tourists to stay in Thailand. With the program, they can change their digital assets to Thailand’s baht currency . This project comes when Thailand aims to attract more tourists to increase revenue, contributing to the nation’s economic growth. Initially piloted in Phuket, the initiative now expands nationwide after receiving positive feedback and strong adoption. Thailand hopes the sandbox will boost tourism revenue and cement its role as a regional fintech leader by embracing crypto-friendly policies. Thailand embraces the crypto sandbox project under stricter regulatory measures The crypto sandbox project has greatly supported the crypto ecosystem. For instance, tourists possessing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin do not have to worry about how they will survive in Thailand. This is because the project permits them to freely access digital asset trading platforms like crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency middlemen, and dealers to convert their cryptocurrencies to the baht. Afterwards, the tourists can pay for goods and services using the QR codes obtained when they use Thailand’s currency on online payment platforms and digital wallets. Notably, based on the country’s regulations, one cannot directly make payments using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, as the project promotes financial technology, it provides a safer way to convert cryptocurrencies into regular money for use under the strict regulations set. The crypto sandbox project also includes protective measures to address economic challenges and ensure tourists use their funds responsibly. To achieve this, the project has outlined well-defined limits on how things will be operated in this sector. According to rules released in Thailand, all service issuers should obtain a license permitting them to carry out their operations and strictly adhere to the country’s know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. In addition, the sandbox has set aside rules that require foreign tourists in the country to undergo identity confirmation processes before taking the initiative to change their digital assets to Thailand’s currency. Similarly, the SEC has also applied spending measures to foreign tourists. Based on this regulation, the regulators will monitor and manage their transactions. For example, the tourists will only be allowed to consume a maximum of ฿50,000, worth nearly USD 1,375 monthly. This spending limitation will apply to local shops like food stalls and markets. On the other hand, for certified businesses like hotels and expensive restaurants, tourists’ monthly consumption limitation is raised to ฿500,000, which is approximately USD 13,750. Since this project is being exercised for the first time, it will effectively last 18 months. This may, however, be extended after regulators examine its performance, public reaction, and safety reports. Thailand’s sandbox project faces criticism from individuals Concerning the sandbox project, the SEC and BOT have opened room for public feedback with a deadline of August 13 this year. The regulators have also called on the individuals involved in the industry, banks, and companies in tourism to weigh in on the situation. This initiative aims to solidify the country’s position as the leader in the fintech space and make Thailand a region of new ideas. With safeguarding measures and regulations in place, it is anticipated that this will create a conducive environment for crypto and traditional money to cooperate and attract proprietors of digital assets worldwide. In the meantime, the project has faced criticism from several Phuket tourism sectors. Based on their argument, there is a shortage of education and communication on the project. This was not all, questions have been raised concerning which cryptocurrencies will be applied in this project, and the risk of abuse in the situation when monitoring systems are not strong enough. Despite all this, the project is still viewed as a game-changer for the tourism sector. If successfully adopted, other countries will be eager to apply it in their tourism sector, becoming a global FinTech trend.

The volatile rally has left certain over-leveraged traders in limbo, as the liquidations for XRP alone are well above $40 million on a daily scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As the immortal Metallica song goes – ‘So close, no matter how far.’ XRP is just in reach of a new all-time high, more than seven years after it set a record at $3.4. The asset has jumped by roughly 50% since last week when it broke out of its consolidation phase, and has skyrocketed by 75% since the late June low of $1.9. CryptoPotato asked ChatGPT about the cryptocurrency’s chances to go into uncharted territory in July since it failed to do so in January this year when it matched the 2018 record. The AI chatbot outlined why the $3.4 resistance could be harder to penetrate than most people expect, but also laid out several bullish factors that could propel another rally. Since then, XRP has increased by a few more cents and jumped to a new six-month peak of $3.34 (on Bitstamp) minutes ago. Thus, it was less than 2% away from a new all-time high. Although it has retraced slightly since then, it’s still above $3.3 as of press time. Its volatile ride has liquidated thousands of speculative traders with both shorts and longs. However, short positions dominate, with over $29 million such liquidations out of the total $44.32 million. Liquidation Heat Map.

2025-07-17T18:10:31,"Bank of America Enters the Stablecoin Race — CEO Makes It Official","Unlike previous market cycles, where banks have predominantly avoided stablecoins and most other cryptocurrency assets, the sentiment is now towards broader acceptance. As key regulations continue to be reviewed, the adoption landscape is evolving. New Chapters Being Written The news of the plan was shared yesterday by Reuters, with the Bank of America (BOA) joining the ranks of various institutional bodies that have endorsed the stablecoin plan under President Trump’s crypto-friendly legislation. Brian Moynihan, the CEO and President of BOA, noted that “ investors can expect the lender to move forward with it, ” but did not disclose any information as to when this can be expected. Further speaking to analysts during a post-earnings call, the CEO’s approach appears to be cautious and calculated, as they are currently exploring customer demand, which is presently low. The groundwork will likely begin “ at the appropriate time ” and “ in partnership with other players, ” with Moynihan comparing current stablecoin adoption levels of the industry with those of payment platforms like Zelle and Venmo. “ We’ve done a lot of work, ” said Moynihan, hinting that this may have been in development for a while now, but with “ banks still awaiting legal clarity, ” the progress has been slower than some investors would have liked. The wait will likely not be very long, as the trio of anticipated legislation bills —CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC — were advanced to the House floor for debate and consideration after a 9-hour stall of the vote. After speaking with the President late on Wednesday, the House Speaker told reporters: “I’m pleased that we’ll be able to get this done. The president is as well. I just spoke with him, and this is a big priority for him, and it was for us.” A Change of Heart The widespread adoption and ongoing plans for stablecoins by central US banks are in stark contrast to how they were viewed not that long ago. For example, when the BOA’s lead was asked if they planned to incorporate cryptocurrency in their services during a past World Economic Forum, the answer was a straightforward “no.” Previously skeptical as well, the third-largest bank in the United States, Citigroup, is also considering issuing its own stablecoin. Vocal bitcoin critic – JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, announced that the entity will also be entering the space, but without sharing any further details.

2025-07-17T18:06:08,"Alteri Launches $30M Tokenized Bitcoin Mining Infrastructure Fund on Chintai Nexus’ Compliant Blockchain","Singapore, Singapore, July 17th, 2025, Alteri is proud to announce the launch of a $30 million tokenized Bitcoin mining infrastructure fund through Chintai Nexus ’ compliant blockchain, providing accredited investors with direct, on-chain access to infrastructure-backed yield. The offering targets 3-6% monthly returns, delivered through automated smart contract distributions. Bridging Bitcoin Mining and Tokenized Assets The infrastructure fund represents a significant innovation in the real-world asset tokenization space, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin mining economics without the operational complexity of running a mining operation themselves. Investor capital funds modular Bitcoin mining operations across ERCOT (Texas), with revenue generated from both mining rewards and participation in energy market programs such as curtailment and ancillary services. ""This launch reflects the next stage of blockchain's evolution—from speculative finance to scalable, compliant capital formation,"" said David Packham, CEO of Chintai. ""It's a live example of how real-world assets can be made investable, auditable, and automated through blockchain."" Innovative Financial Engineering The fund combines elements of structured credit and infrastructure investing, creating a novel financial product native to blockchain. With development costs averaging $200,000 per megawatt and a projected break-even period of just over 12 months, Alteri's operations are designed for capital efficiency. The fund's architecture ensures verifiable on-chain distributions, with additional yield derived from energy arbitrage opportunities in the ERCOT grid. ""We've structured this offering to provide institutional-grade access to Bitcoin mining infrastructure—at a valuation that's significantly lower than public market comps,"" said Alteri's founder. ""It's designed to be transparent, operationally sound, and now fully accessible on-chain."" Tax Advantages and Market Position US-based investors may benefit from 100% bonus depreciation on equipment in 2025, offering the potential for significant after-tax advantages. This feature makes the fund particularly attractive for institutional investors seeking tax-efficient exposure to digital asset infrastructure. The Alteri fund joins a growing ecosystem of tokenized real-world assets on the Chintai platform, which has previously facilitated the tokenization of real estate yields, ESG infrastructure investments, and carbon credits. Each new asset class brought on-chain demonstrates blockchain's expanding utility beyond purely digital assets. Expanding the RWA Ecosystem This launch represents a key milestone in the evolution of blockchain-based finance, moving beyond speculative digital assets to tangible, yield-generating infrastructure investments. By bringing Bitcoin mining economics on-chain, Alteri creates opportunities for greater market efficiency and investor accessibility. The tokenized structure also opens possibilities for future DeFi integrations that would be impossible with traditional securities, including potential composability with lending protocols, liquidity pools, and other on-chain financial primitives. About Chintai Nexus Chintai Nexus is a leading blockchain platform backed by prominent financial institutions, revolutionizing the integration of real-world assets into the digital economy. By leveraging blockchain's inherent security and transparency, Chintai empowers businesses and creators to tokenize RWAs, unlocking new opportunities for liquidity and global accessibility.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 141,000 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may have an explosive move as the payments altcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric is forming a golden cross. The last time the signal flashed bullish was in November 2024, when XRP exploded by triple percentage points. The MVRV metric gauges the market’s sentiment and valuation of a crypto asset. A golden cross occurs when the MVRV metric crosses above its 200-day moving average, signaling long-term bullish momentum. “The last time the MVRV ratio flashed a golden cross, XRP soared 630%. That signal just appeared again.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A 630% increase from XRP’s current value would put the token at more than $20. The analyst previously said XRP is primed to print new all-time highs, setting his initial target to the upside at $4.80. “XRP is screaming all-time highs. Are you seeing this? XRP is testing the top of the channel at $3. A weekly close above the $3 resistance could trigger a breakout to $4.80.” The analyst also says that crypto whales are accumulating massive amounts of the payment token. “Whales have bought 2.20 billion XRP in the last two weeks!” Source: Ali Martinez/X XRP is trading for $3.25 at time of writing, up 8.8% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-17T18:00:00,"Ripple Partners With City Of California To Replicate Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E","In a bold move, California Governor Gavin Newsom launched the “ California Breakthrough Project ,” which brings together Ripple, Coinbase, and other tech companies to help improve government efficiency using Web3. The project closely mirrors the goals of the Department of Government Agency (D.O.G.E.) , a government-focused body founded by Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. Ripple Forms Alliance That Mirrors Musk’s D.O.G.E. A new X social media post by crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett confirms that California has officially partnered with Ripple and other leading crypto and tech firms, possibly replicating Musk’s D.O.G.E. initiative. The new task force aims to transform public services through blockchain and Web3 innovation. Governor Newsom announced the launch of the California Breakthrough Project in a press release on July 15. The newly formed task force held its inaugural meeting on June 6 at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters, bringing together top figures from major tech companies like AME Cloud Ventures, Instacart, Snapchat, Moonpay , Anduril, and more. Others included former Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler and angel investor Ron Conway etc. The similarities between the California Breakthrough Project and Musk’s D.O.G.E. are evident in their shared emphasis on speed, experimentation, and cross-sector problem-solving. However, while D.O.G.E. leaned heavily into rapid implementation and market-style disruption, the California Breakthrough Project seemingly prioritizes ethics, transparency, and civil engagement to avoid public backlash. This balancing act could determine the newly launched project’s long-term viability as it pushes the boundaries of how blockchain and digital assets like XRP might one day integrate with government functions. Ripple’s involvement also reflects its growing influence in institutional and governmental environments. Moreover, with California being one of the largest economies in the world and a supporter of digital currencies , this collaboration with various crypto and tech companies could mark a significant step toward reshaping public perception of cryptocurrencies in a more favorable light. California Taps Crypto And Tech To Modernize Government According to reports, Governor Newsom launched the California Breakthrough Project to integrate input from the state’s leading crypto and tech companies, aiming to overhaul governmental operations from the ground up. The objectives of the project include diagnosing efficiencies in public service delivery and applying emerging technologies like blockchain to improve transparency, responsiveness, and inter-agency collaboration. The overarching strategy involves encouraging tech-led solutions for systemic government problems—a concept similar to the one behind D.O.G.E. By aligning firms that specialize in blockchain, payments, and digital infrastructure, California may not only invest in its technological advancement but also potentially lay the groundwork for the real-time application of Web3 innovation in public systems. The Governor even stated that, as the birthplace of modern tech, California is in a unique position to lead such a groundbreaking change.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-partners-with-california/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Ripple|D.O.G.E.|Department of Government Agency|Eleanor Terret|Elon Musk|Governor Gavin Newsom|Jason Wheeler|ripple|ripple news|Ron Conway|Tesla|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
