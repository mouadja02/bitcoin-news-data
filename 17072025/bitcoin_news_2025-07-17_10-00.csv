2025-07-17T07:44:11,"Thailand Plans Crypto Sandbox Allowing Tourists to Convert Crypto into Local Currency","Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand are preparing to launch a regulatory crypto sandbox that will enable foreign tourists to convert their crypto assets into baht for spending locally. Key Takeaways: Thailand plans to launch a crypto sandbox allowing tourists to convert crypto into baht for spending. The program expands on Phuket‚Äôs pilot and involves licensed operators. Industry experts warn the ecosystem isn‚Äôt fully prepared. The initiative expands on a prior pilot program focused on Phuket and aims to widen crypto adoption across the country‚Äôs broader tourism sector, according to a report by the Bangkok Post . Under the proposed sandbox, visitors would exchange cryptocurrencies through licensed operators and use the converted baht via regulated electronic money platforms, such as QR code payments. Thailand Expands Crypto Sandbox Program The program builds on the concept first introduced by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra‚Äôs Phuket sandbox proposal, which sought to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment options in tourist-heavy areas to boost adoption. Licensed digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers would be eligible to operate within the sandbox for up to 18 months, with the possibility of extension. Operators must adhere to strict eligibility standards, comply with service limitations, observe spending caps for tourists, and follow anti-money laundering rules to participate. However, the initiative has raised concerns among some industry voices. The Tourism Council of Thailand (TCT) cautioned that the government should ensure the readiness of the entire ecosystem before launching the program. Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, TCT‚Äôs vice president, highlighted that many local stakeholders, including those in Phuket, remain unaware of the ongoing public consultation process. THAILAND OPENS DOORS TO CRYPTO-SPENDING FOR TOURISTS ‚Äì Thailand is rolling out a bold new initiative‚Äîforeign tourists can now convert crypto into baht and spend it across the country. Key Details: ‚Äì Thailand‚Äôs SEC and central bank have launched a crypto sandbox. It lets‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/8IsHOaOcU7 ‚Äî BSCN (@BSCNews) July 17, 2025 Money laundering remains a significant worry, particularly with the increase of illicit foreign businesses operating in Phuket. Without clear regulatory frameworks, there is a risk that crypto exchanges could be exploited for illegal activities. Tourism operators are also seeking clarity regarding which crypto assets will be accepted and the scope of permitted exchange services. More Countries Consider Crypto Payments for Tourists In May, Bhutan introduced an initiative that allows tourists to pay for nearly every aspect of their visit using cryptocurrency. The country has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to create the world‚Äôs first national-level crypto tourism payment system. The system enables travelers with Binance accounts to use digital assets for payments ranging from airline tickets and visa fees to hotel stays, tours and even roadside fruit stalls. Likewise, Binance Pay has teamed up with French fintech Lyzi to bring cryptocurrency payment options to over 80 businesses along the French Riviera, including hotspots like Cannes, Nice, Antibes, and Monaco. Customers, both visitors and locals, can now pay using stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies at various establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and luxury retailers by simply scanning a QR code. The system offers instant transaction confirmation without gas fees, while merchants receive immediate euro settlements through the platform‚Äôs integration.

2025-07-17T07:33:49,"Altcoin Season Index Breakout: Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Price Rally","The post Altcoin Season Index Breakout: Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is alive with early signs of an altcoin season. Ethereum surged 20% to $3,339, its highest level in five months, acting as a strong catalyst for altcoins across the board. XRP and Solana followed with 5% gains, signaling capital is starting to shift from Bitcoin into top Layer-1s. Other altcoins like Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink are also gaining traction, supported by institutional interest and growing regulatory clarity. In a new video , Altcoin Daily analysts painted a bullish outlook for the crypto market in 2025, breaking down recent political moves, market trends, and bold expert predictions. Crypto Week Push Analysts say crypto is getting a major boost from U.S. legislation. Congress is set to pass three key bills: the Genius Act (stablecoin rules), the Clarity Act (crypto classification), and a bill to block a U.S. CBDC. The Genesis Act has already passed the Senate and is likely to be signed soon, fueling fresh confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoins on the Move With current Altcoin season is heating up as CryptoQuant‚Äôs MVRV indicator shows sustained altcoin momentum for the first time in over a year. Capital is rotating out of Bitcoin into Layer-1s like SUI (+36%), SEI (+41%), and ETH (+23.3%), while meme coin interest fades. Continued BTC consolidation above $112K could boost altcoins, but sharp BTC moves may pull liquidity away. Ethereum recently crossed $3,300 for the first time in five months, a clear signal of returning strength to altcoins. $ETH strength is the domino that triggers altcoin euphoria. Not too far away now, play your cards right and you'll be rewarded. ‚Äî VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 16, 2025 Crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading toward the $4,000 mark . He suggests that any short-term corrections or pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities. I think that $ETH is on the path towards $4,000. That means, if there are any corrections taking place, it would be great to be using those to buy the dips in. pic.twitter.com/C5TdezUWxv ‚Äî Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 16, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Four Global Crypto Exchanges Listed in Q2 2025 , Bitcoin Price Predictions Katie Stockton (Fairlead Strategies) sees Bitcoin topping at $135,000, based entirely on technical analysis.

On July 14, Bitcoin price briefly touched $123,000 before cooling off. While BTC posted a modest 0.7% gain in the past 24 hours, Ethereum surged by 7.3%, XRP by 7.7%, BNB by 3.4%, Solana by 5.2%, Dogecoin by 7%, and Cardano by 3.7%, signaling a potential altcoin season. Why Ethereum Is Soaring: Spot ETFs See Historic Inflows Ethereum‚Äôs price explosion is largely driven by unprecedented inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs .

Ethereum‚Äôs price is rising due to record inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs. On July 14, over $726 million flowed into ETH ETFs, led by BlackRock and Fidelity. This surge in institutional demand is driving Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum. What caused Ethereum to cross $3,300? The price breakout above $3,300 was fueled by massive spot ETF purchases, far outpacing new ETH issuance. ETFs bought over 107 times more ETH than was created by the network in the last 24 hours. How much ETH do spot ETFs hold now? As of today, spot Ethereum ETFs hold over 5 million ETH, which accounts for approximately 4% of Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply. Is this the beginning of altcoin season? Yes, Ethereum‚Äôs outperformance and the rotation of capital into XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and others suggest that altcoin season may be starting.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-price-explodes-40-in-july-as-etf-inflows-hit-record-726m/,"ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T07:10:33,"Hugging Face‚Äôs Remarkable Leap: How Open-Source AI Devices Are Revolutionizing Consumer Robotics","BitcoinWorld Hugging Face‚Äôs Remarkable Leap: How Open-Source AI Devices Are Revolutionizing Consumer Robotics In a world increasingly shaped by decentralized technologies and the burgeoning power of artificial intelligence, a fascinating development is unfolding that bridges the gap between complex AI models and everyday consumer interaction. Just five days after opening orders for its innovative Reachy Mini robots, AI developer platform Hugging Face announced an astounding $1 million in sales. This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone, not only for Hugging Face, primarily known for its open-source AI model repository, but also for the broader landscape of consumer robotics . This rapid success signals a shift, demonstrating a growing appetite among consumers for accessible, hackable AI experiences right in their homes. The Rise of Hugging Face in Consumer Robotics Hugging Face‚Äôs foray into hardware with the Reachy Mini is a bold move that underscores its commitment to democratizing artificial intelligence. While the company has long been a cornerstone for developers seeking to download and utilize open-source AI models, this venture into physical products brings their vision to life in a tangible way. The immediate financial success of the Reachy Mini suggests a strong market demand for AI-powered devices that are not just functional but also engaging and approachable. Unlike other emerging players in the home robotics sector, such as Figure and 1X, which are focused on creating humanoid robots designed to perform household chores, Hugging Face envisions the Reachy Mini as a different kind of companion. As Hugging Face co-founder and chief scientist Thomas Wolf explained on Bitcoin World‚Äôs podcast, Equity, the Reachy Mini is conceived as a ‚Äòhackable, entertainment device.‚Äô This distinction is crucial, as it repositions the robot from a utilitarian tool to a creative platform. Imagine a small, desk-friendly robot with two cameras for eyes, microphones, speakers, a bobbing head, and playful antennas ‚Äì it‚Äôs designed to be endearing, inviting interaction and experimentation. What Makes the Reachy Mini a Game-Changer in AI Devices? The Reachy Mini‚Äôs design philosophy is rooted in accessibility and customization. While it comes with pre-set applications, its true power lies in its ability to allow users to build and run their own apps locally through open-source software. This ‚Äòhackable‚Äô nature aligns perfectly with Hugging Face‚Äôs core mission of fostering an open AI ecosystem. Thomas Wolf even likened the Reachy Mini to ‚Äòan empty iPhone,‚Äô a powerful analogy hinting at the potential for a vast network of user-generated applications and a thriving developer community around the device. This vision aims to replicate the explosive growth and innovation seen in the mobile app market, but for personal robots. Key features that contribute to its appeal and potential for robotics innovation include: Compact and Friendly Design: Its small size and ‚Äòcute‚Äô aesthetics make it suitable for a desk, encouraging daily interaction. Open-Source Platform: Empowering users to develop custom applications, fostering creativity and a diverse ecosystem. Accessible Price Point: Making AI-powered robotics available to a broader audience, reducing barriers to entry. Entertainment and Learning Focus: Shifting from chore-automation to an interactive companion that can entertain, teach, and inspire. The device‚Äôs viral launch can be attributed not only to its friendly design and accessible price but also to the innate human curiosity about interacting with AI in a physical form. Wolf emphasizes that making the robot affordable and desirable for everyday display is central to its launch strategy. It serves as an entry point for consumers to become comfortable with robots in their homes, building trust and familiarity with AI-powered companions. The Strategic Vision: Open-Source AI Paving the Way Hugging Face‚Äôs strategic pivot into hardware is a calculated move to capitalize on the growing convergence of software and physical computing. The acquisition of the French robotics startup Pollen played a pivotal role in this expansion, providing Hugging Face with the foundational expertise needed to transition from a purely software-centric platform to a hardware innovator. Wolf‚Äôs insistence on developing a robot at a low price point reflects a deep understanding of market dynamics and the importance of mass adoption for a new technology. The core belief driving this venture is that open-source AI will play as transformative a role in robotics as it has in software development. Just as open-source models have accelerated AI research and application development, Hugging Face believes they can unlock unprecedented innovation in the robotics sector. By providing an open platform, they aim to cultivate a community of developers who will create diverse and unforeseen applications for the Reachy Mini, pushing the boundaries of what these AI devices can do. From Software to Hardware: A Bold Leap for Robotics Innovation The transition from a leading AI software platform to a hardware manufacturer presents unique challenges and opportunities. Hugging Face‚Äôs approach focuses on leveraging its existing community and expertise in open-source collaboration. This strategy could allow them to iterate faster, gather diverse feedback, and adapt to market needs more effectively than traditional hardware companies. The vision extends beyond the Reachy Mini, with ambitions to one day sell full-sized humanoid robots, indicating a long-term commitment to shaping the future of robotics. Key aspects of this strategic leap include: Community-Driven Development: Relying on the vast Hugging Face developer community to build a rich app ecosystem for the robots. Cost-Effective Manufacturing: Prioritizing affordability to ensure widespread adoption and market penetration. Scalable Vision: Starting with a small, accessible robot to lay the groundwork for more complex and larger robotic systems in the future. Democratizing Robotics: Making robotics development and ownership accessible to individuals and small teams, not just large corporations. This approach could fundamentally alter the competitive landscape, creating a more dynamic and inclusive environment for robotics innovation . It empowers individuals to experiment with AI in the physical world, potentially leading to breakthroughs that might not emerge from traditional, closed development cycles. Addressing Privacy in Consumer Robotics Through Open Source A critical consideration in the proliferation of consumer robotics is privacy. As AI devices become more integrated into our homes, concerns about data collection, security, and surveillance naturally arise. Hugging Face‚Äôs commitment to open-source principles offers a potential solution to these challenges. By making the software open and transparent, users and developers can inspect the code, understand how data is handled, and contribute to more secure and privacy-preserving solutions. This contrasts sharply with proprietary systems, where data handling often remains opaque to the end-user. The transparency inherent in open-source development can foster greater trust among consumers. When users can verify how their data is processed and know that a community of developers is scrutinizing the code for vulnerabilities, it can alleviate some of the privacy concerns associated with smart home devices. This commitment to privacy through transparency is a significant selling point, especially in an era where data breaches and privacy violations are increasingly common.

2025-07-17T07:04:51,"Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Paying $120,000,000 To Settle Lawsuit Tied to Investment Firm‚Äôs Collapse: Report","Three top US banks will hand over more than $100 million to settle a lawsuit related to the collapse of a multi-billion-dollar investment firm. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have agreed to pay a combined $120 million to settle a lawsuit alleging they hid conflicts of interest when selling ViacomCBS shares, which contributed to the collapse of Bill Hwang‚Äôs Archegos Capital Management, reports Reuters. The case against the three banks was filed last month by former shareholders of ViacomCBS, now known as Paramount Global. Archegos, a family office that once managed $36 billion, collapsed in March of 2021 when Hwang‚Äôs leveraged investment bets in ViacomCBS and other firms fell through. Archegos had about $20 billion of ViacomCBS exposure. The three banks helped Archegos place massive bets on ViacomCBS and other stocks, while at the same time, they acted as underwriters for ViacomCBS in a secondary offering. Investors led by the Camelot Event Driven Fund and the Municipal Police Employees‚Äô Retirement System of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, accused the three banks of hiding their roles with Archegos and selling off their shares to avoid losses. The settlement is pending approval by a judge in New York state court. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Wells Fargo have denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the lawsuit. Hwang and former Archegos chief financial officer Patrick Halligan were convicted of fraud in 2024 over the firm‚Äôs collapse. Hwang was sentenced to 18 years in prison and Halligan was sentenced to eight years in prison. Both are appealing while out on bail.

This surge comes after Ethereum formed a key technical pattern, the inverse head and shoulders, a strong bullish signal often seen before major rallies. This breakout has sparked huge optimism, with leading trader Crypto Patel calling Ethereum ‚Äúmega bullish.‚Äù But will it be a smooth ride to $10,000? Maybe not. Ethereum Gains Strength as ETH/BTC Surges 50% Since April The recent rally didn‚Äôt happen overnight. Many believe big investors have been quietly buying Ethereum, creating strong buying pressure. At the same time, institutional money is flowing in, signaling continued trust in ETH as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum isn‚Äôt just gaining in dollar value; it‚Äôs also performing well against Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC pair has bounced more than 50% since April and recently broke out of a bullish flag pattern. Meanwhile, analysts like VirtualBacon and Micha√´l van de Poppe see this as a sign that Ethereum‚Äôs strength is growing. If this trend holds, the ETH/BTC pair could climb another 30%, pushing ETH prices even higher. Can ETH Price Reach $10K? The big buzz comes from Ethereum breaking out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. Crypto Patel predicts this move could send ETH to $6,000 soon, with long-term targets of $8,000 and even $10,000. Ethereum just broke out of a massive inverse head & shoulders and it‚Äôs flying past $3,400 again after 5 months.

A dip to around $2,800 could happen before the next big leg up, a common shakeout before strong rallies. Oversold Levels Hint at Strength Supporting the bullish case, analyst Stockmoney Lizards highlighted that Ethereum looks oversold against Bitcoin. The weekly RSI on ETH/BTC is at 23, the lowest since September 2019, just before Ethereum began a significant rally. Based on this, they see a mid-term target of $4,500, which would still mark significant upside from current levels. Now, all eyes are on whether ETH can maintain its position and continue to attract whales and institutional interest.

2025-07-17T07:02:17,"ETH gets a boost to over $3.4k as open interest peaks","Ethereum (ETH) is finally having its breakout day, as BTC dominance stalled. ETH recovered the $3,300 level, setting expectations for an even more significant run. Ethereum (ETH) broke out to $3,359.11, reaching a three-month peak and recovering some of its losses from the slump in March and April. ETH is closely watched for its ability to break out even higher after months of weakness against BTC. ETH also gained to 0.029 BTC, as the leading coin is consolidating at $118,000. The recent ETH recovery also sparked hopes for a full altcoin market, or at least a spillover to the Ethereum ecosystem. The recent ETH breakout after months of relative weakness sets expectations that the token may repeat historical bull rallies, stopping at a much higher range. Ethereum open interest rises to three-year peak The recent ETH rally is driven by derivative trading. Open interest on crypto exchanges expanded to a three-year peak above $22B. ETH open interest rose to a three-year peak above $22B, with a predominance of long positions. | Source: Coinalyze . For ETH, the breakout in open interest suggests the asset is finally seen as more lively, after months of low trading activity and open interest under $10B. The current open interest holds around 65% in long positions, as traders are cautious about drawdowns. ETH has now broken way above the liquidation levels on DeFi protocols. The first significant liquidation thresholds start as low as $1,600 , making most lending protocols highly secure. The recent spike in open interest may also increase liquidations for ETH traders. Long positions may be at a higher risk, as there are almost no short positions left to attack. Based on the recent accrued liquidity, ETH may take a dip to $3,200 to liquidate over $59M in long positions. During the rally above $3,000, ETH mostly erased short positions. For the past 24 hours, ETH became the liquidation leader, with $196.74M liquidated. Binance was the leader, with over $149M of the liquidations concentrated on its markets. In comparison, BTC only saw around $45M in daily liquidations . At this point, ETH may reverse its direction as there are almost no significant short positions left to liquidate. The current price move started with a significant accumulation of short positions at the end of June, leading to the current short squeeze. However, the conditions for ETH remain uncertain and dependent on trader sentiment. Spot demand for ETH may recover ETH is not seen as a truly scarce resource, but whales, institutions and companies are showing signs of accumulation for the long term. Holding ETH is also possible while also tapping the asset‚Äôs value through staking or liquid staking. One of the sources of demand for ETH is the growing list of treasury companies. Following the model for BTC, multiple entities are building treasuries. The leader as of July 17 is SharpLink gaming, with its aggressive buying schedule. Following the recent ETH rally, SBET shares rose to $38.37, potentially setting the stage for more future purchases. BitDigital (BTBT), which switched from a BTC to an ETH treasury, also benefitted from the ETH rally. BTBT shares rose to $3.93, their highest level for 2025. The recovery of ETH to a higher range is raising the shares of other treasury companies . An ongoing rally can further accelerate the trend, putting more ETH into the hands of big holders. ETH remains accessible for retailers, but is turning into a play for whales aiming to tap passive income.

2025-07-17T07:00:14,"XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says","A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how an XRP close above this level could trigger a run to $4.80, based on a technical analysis pattern. XRP Could See A Surge To New Highs If It Manages This Weekly Close In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has cited a technical analysis (TA) pattern to talk about where XRP can go next. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel. Parallel Channels form whenever an asset‚Äôs price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. A break out of either of these levels can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. There can be different types of Parallel Channels, depending on how the trendlines are oriented with respect to the axes. When they are slopped upwards, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, them having a negative slope makes the formation a Descending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Key Level Is $136,000 If Momentum Holds, Glassnode Says In the context of the current topic, the third and the most ordinary type is of relevance: a Parallel Channel with trendlines parallel to the time-axis. This pattern corresponds to true sideways consolidation in the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-week price of XRP has seemingly been following during the last few months. As is visible in the graph, the weekly XRP price has observed a sharp surge recently and closed in on the upper level of the Parallel Channel. If the asset‚Äôs current trajectory maintains, it could end up making a retest of the upper line situated around $3. Earlier in the year, the cryptocurrency encountered resistance at the mark, so it‚Äôs possible that something similar could occur this time as well. In the event that it is able to surge past the line, however, a bullish breakout might take place. ‚ÄúA weekly close above $3 could send XRP to a new all-time high of $4.80!‚Äù says Martinez. From the current price of the coin, a rally to this target would imply a gain of about 56%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $117,000 Amid $3.5 Billion Profit-Taking Frenzy It now remains to be seen whether the digital asset will manage to escape out of the Parallel Channel and if it does, whether a bull run of this magnitude would follow. In some other news, the 1-week price of Ethereum is also heading toward the resistance line of a Parallel Channel, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. ‚ÄúA key resistance level ahead for Ethereum $ETH is $3,980,‚Äù notes Martinez. ‚ÄúBreaking above it could ignite a major bull rally!‚Äù XRP Price XRP has seen a fresh 7% surge in the last 24 hours that has taken its price to $3.08.
