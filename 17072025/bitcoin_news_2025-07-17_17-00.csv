2025-07-17T14:58:09,"Solana gains momentum while Ethereum tries to hold ground","DeFi Development is rolling out a global franchise for its Solana-based treasury model, betting that its structure will appeal to crypto firms looking for something more aggressive than just stacking bitcoin. The company is calling it the DFDV Treasury Accelerator, and it‚Äôs designed to give partners a way to operate their own Solana treasuries with backing from DeFi, while DeFi holds equity in every regional branch. This move was reported by CoinDesk. The model flips the typical approach by mixing staking infrastructure, capital market strategies, and now international franchise operations. That combination is what makes the whole thing different, said Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital, one of DeFi‚Äôs supporters. ‚ÄúMost crypto treasury vehicles today are following the MicroStrategy model. What excites us about DFDV is that they‚Äôre not just copying the playbook. They‚Äôre evolving it,‚Äù Cosmo said . Pantera had also backed Bitmine Immersion Technologies, an ether-focused treasury company tied to Peter Thiel and Tom Lee from Fundstrat. Kraken, Arrington, and others eye franchise support The list of possible partners doesn‚Äôt stop at Pantera. Kraken, Arrington, RK Capital, and Borderless Capital are also considering participation, not just through capital but also with help on validator services, custody solutions, and fundraising plans. These aren‚Äôt soft partnerships. These are the kinds of groups that bring infrastructure into play, especially in areas like staking and long-term treasury maintenance. The timing of this expansion is not random. The whole space is being flooded with treasury activity. Companies are spinning up crypto treasuries or jumping into SPACs to mirror MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy of hoarding bitcoin on the balance sheet. Bitmine isn‚Äôt alone. SharpLink Gaming recently kicked off its own ether treasury strategy in May, with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin stepping in as board chairman. Then there‚Äôs Bit Digital, which pulled the plug on its bitcoin mining operation to lean fully into ETH staking instead. DeFi‚Äôs move puts all of that focus directly on Solana. They aren‚Äôt just buying tokens; they‚Äôre accumulating and staking SOL, and they‚Äôre buying validators‚Äîthe computers that secure and run the Solana blockchain. This is how staking works. The more SOL they hold and stake, the more rewards they collect. The company recently published its first public SOL-per-share target, saying it‚Äôs aiming for 1 SOL per share by 2028. That goal starts from its current count of 857,749 SOL spread across 18.8 million shares, which brings the present figure to 0.0457 SOL per share. DeFi CEO Joseph Onorati said this setup is their way of scaling globally without touching share dilution. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre exporting our framework for Solana treasury accumulation, while bringing global partners into the DFDV orbit, all aligned through economics, staking, and shared infrastructure. The opportunity is massive,‚Äù Joseph said. Solana gains momentum while Ethereum tries to hold ground Price movement helps make the case. Solana is now trading near $175.56, right around the neckline of a long-developing cup and handle pattern that started forming back in early 2025. That pattern began building off a $120 base and has now pushed the asset to critical resistance around $176 to $178. The last 12 months have seen a 7% increase, with almost 10% growth in just the past month, according to Coin Metrics. But what might be more important than price is what‚Äôs happening in the real-world asset (RWA) space. Solana‚Äôs RWA activity is growing faster than Ethereum‚Äôs in 2025. RWAxyz data shows that Solana‚Äôs RWA total has risen from $173.8 million in January to $553.8 million, up 218% year-to-date and 22% in the past month. That‚Äôs a massive gain, especially compared to Ethereum‚Äôs slower growth. To be fair, Ethereum still holds the lead in terms of total value. It controls $7.7 billion of the $13.5 billion worth of tokenized RWAs currently live on public networks. Solana‚Äôs share is still smaller, but with the pace it‚Äôs growing, it‚Äôs a threat to that lead. Ethereum‚Äôs RWA value has only climbed 81% this year, from $4.3 billion to $7.7 billion. Solana‚Äôs already more than tripled its number and isn‚Äôt slowing down. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-17T14:50:01,"Bitcoin ETPs Soar: Virtune Unveils Revolutionary Staked Solana ETP on Xetra","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETPs Soar: Virtune Unveils Revolutionary Staked Solana ETP on Xetra Are you looking for innovative ways to gain exposure to the exciting world of cryptocurrencies through regulated financial products? The landscape of digital asset investment is constantly evolving, and a significant development has just unfolded that could reshape how investors access leading cryptocurrencies. Swedish digital asset manager Virtune has made a strategic move, listing its Virtune Bitcoin Prime ETP and Virtune Staked Solana ETP on the Deutsche B√∂rse Xetra exchange. This expansion not only broadens their portfolio of physically-backed crypto exchange-traded products in Germany but also marks a pivotal moment for mainstream crypto adoption. It‚Äôs an opportunity for both institutional and retail investors to engage with digital assets in a more familiar and regulated environment. Virtune‚Äôs Vision: Expanding Access to Digital Assets in Europe Virtune, as a forward-thinking digital asset manager, has consistently aimed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. Their latest listings on the Xetra exchange are a testament to this commitment. By offering these physically-backed products, Virtune provides investors with a secure and efficient way to participate in the growth of Bitcoin and Solana without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating unregulated exchanges. This move is particularly impactful for the German market, known for its robust regulatory framework and strong investor base. Virtune‚Äôs expansion underscores a broader trend: the increasing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets into conventional investment portfolios. ‚ÄúOur mission is to make digital assets accessible and understandable for everyone,‚Äù stated a Virtune spokesperson. ‚ÄúListing on Xetra is a crucial step in fulfilling that mission, offering regulated, transparent, and secure investment vehicles for leading cryptocurrencies.‚Äù Demystifying the Bitcoin ETP: A Gateway to Digital Gold For many investors, Bitcoin represents the foundational digital asset, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô However, direct investment can present hurdles. This is where a Bitcoin ETP (Exchange Traded Product) becomes invaluable. An ETP is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts. Virtune‚Äôs Bitcoin Prime ETP offers efficient exposure to Bitcoin with a remarkably competitive annual management fee of just 0.25%. This low fee structure is designed to maximize investor returns by minimizing ongoing costs, making it an attractive option for long-term holders. The benefits of investing in a Bitcoin ETP include: Accessibility: Tradeable on traditional exchanges like Xetra, no need for crypto wallets. Regulation: Operates under a regulated framework, offering enhanced investor protection. Liquidity: Benefits from the liquidity of traditional markets. Security: Physical backing means the ETP holds actual Bitcoin, often with institutional-grade custody solutions. This product simplifies the investment process, allowing investors to focus on market trends rather than technical complexities. Unlocking Enhanced Returns: What Makes the Staked Solana ETP Unique? While Bitcoin remains a staple, the world of altcoins offers diverse opportunities. Solana, known for its high-performance blockchain and fast transaction speeds, has emerged as a significant player. The Virtune Staked Solana ETP takes this a step further by offering staking rewards, a feature that sets it apart from traditional ETPs. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network (in Solana‚Äôs case, its Proof-of-Stake mechanism) and, in return, earning rewards. This ETP is designed to pass these rewards on to investors, potentially enhancing overall returns beyond just price appreciation. Consider the potential for compounding returns: Feature Standard Crypto ETP Staked Solana ETP (Virtune) Underlying Asset Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency (Solana) Returns Mechanism Price Appreciation Price Appreciation + Staking Rewards Complexity for Investor Low Low (staking managed by issuer) Potential Yield Market Dependent Market Dependent + Staking Yield This innovative structure makes the Solana ETP particularly appealing to investors seeking not just exposure but also a yield-generating component from their digital asset investments, all within a regulated wrapper. It reflects the growing sophistication of crypto investment products. The Strategic Advantage of Listing on Xetra Exchange The choice of the Deutsche B√∂rse Xetra Exchange for these listings is highly strategic. Xetra is one of Europe‚Äôs leading trading venues, renowned for its high liquidity, advanced trading technology, and robust regulatory oversight. Listing on such a prominent exchange provides several key advantages: Increased Visibility: Exposure to a vast network of institutional and retail investors across Europe. Enhanced Liquidity: High trading volumes on Xetra facilitate easier buying and selling, reducing price impact. Regulatory Compliance: Operating under German financial regulations instills greater confidence and trust among investors. Accessibility for Traditional Investors: Integrates digital asset products into existing financial infrastructure, making them accessible via conventional brokerage platforms. This move solidifies the legitimacy of digital asset products within traditional financial markets and opens doors for broader adoption by a diverse investor base that might otherwise be hesitant to venture into direct crypto investments. The Broader Impact: The Rise of Crypto ETPs and Institutional Adoption Virtune‚Äôs latest offerings are part of a larger, undeniable trend: the increasing institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies through regulated investment vehicles. Crypto ETPs have become a preferred method for asset managers and investors to gain exposure to digital assets. They offer a familiar structure, regulatory clarity, and often better liquidity than direct market access, particularly for larger players. This growing acceptance signals a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond its early, often volatile, speculative phase into a more integrated part of the global financial system. The introduction of more sophisticated products like staked ETPs further diversifies the investment landscape, offering new avenues for yield and risk management. As regulators continue to provide clearer guidelines, we can expect to see an even greater influx of capital into this space, leading to more innovative products and increased market efficiency. To understand more about the regulatory landscape, you can read our detailed analysis on European crypto regulations. Navigating the Future: What This Means for Your Investment Strategy For investors considering digital assets, Virtune‚Äôs new ETPs offer compelling opportunities. They provide a straightforward way to add Bitcoin and Solana exposure to a diversified portfolio, benefiting from market movements and, in the case of Solana, staking rewards. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that while ETPs mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, they do not eliminate market volatility. The value of the underlying cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly. Actionable Insights for Investors: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are volatile; invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversify: Consider allocating a small portion of your portfolio to digital assets, alongside traditional investments. Research: Understand the underlying assets (Bitcoin, Solana) and the specific features of the ETPs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments and regulatory changes. These products are particularly well-suited for investors who seek regulated, transparent, and secure access to the crypto market without delving into the complexities of self-custody or navigating less-regulated exchanges. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Asset Investment Virtune‚Äôs listing of the Bitcoin Prime ETP and Staked Solana ETP on the Xetra exchange represents a significant milestone in the journey of digital assets towards mainstream financial integration. By offering efficient, regulated, and innovative products, Virtune is not only expanding its footprint but also empowering investors with more accessible and secure pathways to participate in the growth of the crypto economy. This development solidifies the trend of institutional adoption and paves the way for a more mature and diverse digital asset investment landscape in Europe and beyond. It‚Äôs an exciting time for those watching the convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized future.

2025-07-17T14:46:16,"$895M Stablecoin Surge Hits Binance as Whale Retreat Signals Massive Sell-Offs","A sharp shift in on-chain flows has captured market attention, as nearly $900 million in stablecoin flooded into Binance this week while large Bitcoin holders quietly withdrew. The activity signals a potential change in strategy from institutional players, coinciding with rising political uncertainty in the U.S. Crypto Capital Rotation Intensifies as Trump-Powell Drama Fuels Risk-On Sentiment According to a CryptoQuant report , blockchain data shows that large Bitcoin holders, or whales, are pulling back from major exchanges. In the last 30 days, whale deposits to Binance have plunged by $2.25 billion, down from $6.75 billion to $4.5 billion. This steep decline suggests a significant reduction in sell pressure, as whales historically move BTC to exchanges ahead of large liquidations. Their silence now could be a form of market restraint, potentially reducing the likelihood of a sharp correction. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, capital is rushing in. On July 16 alone, Binance recorded over $895 million in stablecoin inflows, closely trailed by HTX with $819 million. These aren‚Äôt retail deposits. The volume and synchronicity suggest coordinated accumulation by institutional players. With whales stepping back and deep-pocketed buyers stepping in, the conditions are aligning for what on-chain analysts call a ‚Äúliquidity inversion,‚Äù where inflows surge even as traditional sellers hold back. The last time markets saw a similar structure, prices ripped upward. But this fragile bullish setup is now being shaken by political uncertainty. Rumors emerged this week that Donald Trump had discussed firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers. However, Trump later publicly denied any plans to oust Powell. The potential removal of Powell, who represents a more hawkish, rate-hike-prone Fed, rattled investors. Bond yields rose, the dollar slipped, and capital began rotating into risk assets like crypto. Bitcoin Market on Edge as $4.7B in Dormant BTC Moves and Tether Mints $3B USDT Layered on top of this backdrop is an unsettling movement on-chain. One of the oldest Bitcoin whales has reawakened after more than a decade of silence. This entity, which first acquired 80,000 BTC in 2011, has now moved more than 40,000 BTC , worth approximately $4.77 billion, into a new wallet. A dormant whale shifted $2.1B in BTC to Galaxy Digital, sending Bitcoin down from $123K to $117K and fueling concerns of major holders offloading. #WhaleWallet #GalaxyDigital https://t.co/7LMgSJ2xVO ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 15, 2025 Earlier in the week, the same wallet had transferred 9,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital, followed shortly by another 7,800 BTC. Galaxy, in turn, moved 6,000 BTC to exchanges including Binance and Bybit. While it‚Äôs not yet clear whether these are sales or reorganizations, the movements have stirred fears of an imminent liquidation wave. A wallet transferred 1,042 $BTC ($122.54M) to a new wallet 20 minutes ago after being dormant for 6 years. This wallet received 1,042 $BTC ($9.12M at the time) from Braiins Mining and Xapo Bank 6 years ago, when the price of $BTC was $8,746. https://t.co/BLsel9fBf7 pic.twitter.com/1RMAJtzzyq ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2025 Adding to the tension, another dormant wallet containing 1,042 BTC, roughly $122 million, became active after six years. Whether these are cold storage reshuffles or pre-sell positioning, the sudden activity has traders rattled. On the stablecoin front, Tether has made one of its most aggressive moves in recent memory. On July 16, the company minted $3 billion worth of USDT in under 24 hours, issuing $2 billion first and another $1 billion shortly after. PSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Ethereum Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps. ‚Äî Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) July 16, 2025 As these forces play out, Bitcoin is holding steady at around $118,200, down slightly from its all-time high of $123,000 reached earlier this week. Despite the stability, market internals hint at a cooling phase. Exchange inflows are ticking up, a classic signal of profit-taking. Retail investors appear to be rotating funds onto platforms at a faster pace, even as whales slow their deposits. Yet conviction remains unusually strong among new entrants. Data from Glassnode reveals that first-time BTC buyers now hold 4.91 million coins, up from 4.77 million just two weeks ago. That‚Äôs an inflow of approximately 140,000 BTC, more than $23 billion, bought near the top. Short-term holders now carry a cost basis above $100,000 for the first time in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, showing aggressive dip-buying during Bitcoin‚Äôs recent slide below $116,000. Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time $BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M #BTC . Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout. pic.twitter.com/W95HSAMaHI ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 17, 2025 This growing divergence between the retail enthusiasm and whale caution has analysts on edge. If more legacy wallets begin to liquidate, it could unravel the current structure and spark a swift sentiment reversal. But for now, Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains resilient, buoyed by stablecoin inflows, reduced sell pressure, and a macro shift pushing investors toward risk.

2025-07-17T14:45:24,"Block Hints At Q2 2025 Double-Beat Performance, Bitcoin Bet Appears Promising","Summary The bulls quietly price in a potential FQ2'25 double-beat performance, as observed in XYZ's robust stock price recovery, thanks to the management's promising commentaries in the May 2025 conference. This is significantly aided by the potential passing of the long-awaited cryptocurrency bill, with Bitcoins likely to be publicly adopted as an alternative to fiat currency. This development underscores XYZ's strategic launch of Bitcoin payments on Square from 2026 onwards, allowing them to monetize their Bitcoin horde on balance sheet. This is significantly aided by the management's determination to drive renewed growth through increased density on its Cash App platform, allowing it to drive improved engagement and monetization. We shall discuss the caveats linked to our reiterated Buy rating for the XYZ stock. Block's Bitcoin Bet Turning Out As Expected: Reversal In Progress We previously covered Block (NYSE: XYZ ) in April 2025, discussing how the mixed Cash App performance in FQ4'24 and the lumpy FQ1'25 guidance had triggered the stock's selloff, worsened by the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Even so, thanks to the fintech's expanding profit margins, the richer balance sheet, and the promising FY2025 guidance, we had believed that the bottom might already be here, especially since the management had continued investing in its growth initiatives across Square/Cash App and merchant partners while reducing headcounts to drive profitable growth. XYZ 1Y Stock Price Trading View Since then, XYZ has had a robust recovery by +28.4% compared to the wider market at +18.7%, with a similar performance also observed in its fintech peers in varying degrees. This is despite the steep one-day meltdown by -20.4% observed in early May 2025 after the double miss observed in the FQ1'25 earnings call, along with the lowered FY2025 guidance , with it naturally triggering questions about its future prospects at a time of intensifying fintech/cryptocurrency payment competition. For reference, XYZ previously offered FY2025 gross profit guidance of at least +15% YoY, adj operating income of $2.1B (+21% YoY), and Rule of 35.5% in the FQ4'24 earnings call, before unceremoniously lowering those numbers to +12% YoY, $1.9B (+19% YoY), and 31% in the FQ1'25 earnings call, respectively. This is worsened by FQ1'25's poorer performance at +9% YoY, +28% YoY, and 29% already paling in comparison against the lowered guidance, worsened by the notable deceleration from FY2024 growth profile at +18% YoY, $1.61B (+360% YoY), and 36.5%, respectively. As a result, we can understand why the market has decided to sell first and ask later, with the fintech seemingly lagging its increasingly more competitive peers. On the other hand, XYZ's recent commentaries in the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media, and Communications Conference have been quietly optimistic indeed, with the management already highlighting notable sequential improvements in the Cash App performance in April 2025 compared to that in Q1'25. For example, Cash App's gross profit growth has improved to +13% YoY in April 2025 compared to that of +7% YoY reported in March 2025, with a similarly promising cadence also observed in the Cash App inflows per active at +9% YoY compared to +5% YoY, respectively, with the uptrend continuing to early May 2025. These have demonstrated the excellent health of XYZ's customer base and the robust demand for its fintech offerings, with it likely to trigger a sequentially improved FQ2'25 performance compared to the recently offered gross profit growth guidance at +9.5% YoY. These are well supported by the resilient US labor market , which perhaps explains why the stock has recovered by the rich double digits since the May 2025 bottom, as the market prices in a potential FQ2'25 double beat. This is significantly aided by XYZ's determination to drive renewed growth through increased ""density"", with the idea of growing the adoption of its vertically integrated Cash App offerings across paycheck deposit, digital/P2P payment, debit/credit card, lending (through its in-house bank, Square Financial Services), cash flow management (including savings), and investment (including stocks and bitcoin), amongst others: And if Cash App can be a hub and also present a spending device to these folks, and more and more of them are our teams, which is a big part of our focus, then not only can we grow the network, but we can also grow the density, and we can build engagement ( Seeking Alpha ) XYZ has also highlighted its plans to expand its fintech/banking ecosystem through its in-house bank, Square Financial Services , with the internalized loan servicing/origination expected to deliver ""better unit economics on an already profitable P&L"", otherwise known as a lower cost of funding for its loan segment. Given that the subscription and services-based segment (arising from Square loans, BNPL platform , and interest incomes) is the fintech's top/bottom-line growth driver, with a +12.5% YoY in revenue growth , +13.3% YoY in gross profit growth, and 85.1% in gross profit margins (+0.6 points YoY) in FQ1'25, we concur with the management's engagement strategy indeed. Moving on, XYZ has further doubled down on its bitcoin ambitions through the upcoming release of Proto , its first 3nm bitcoin mining chips and customized systems in H2'25 , with an estimated total market size of up to $6B, and the segment is expected to drive further gross profit growth. This is on top of the upcoming launch of bitcoin payments ( BTC-USD ) on Square from 2026 onwards, a timely decision given the "" regulatory progress and rising institutional demand,"" with the US lawmakers seemingly closer to passing the long-awaited cryptocurrency bill. Assuming so, it appears that XYZ's bitcoin bet has turned out as expected, with the cryptocurrency seemingly on its way to be publicly adopted as an alternative to fiat currency, perhaps explaining why BTC-USD has already hit new peaks of $122.65K by mid-July 2025. The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Tikr Terminal Even so, it is apparent that XYZ will need to deliver promising results from its ongoing growth initiatives before the market may be fully convinced, as observed in the consistently lowered consensus forward estimates. This is with the fintech expected to report a decelerating top/ bottom-line growth at a CAGR of +7.3%/ +11.2% between FY2024 and FY2027, compared to the prior estimates of +11%/ +25.4% and the 5Y historical growth profile at +60.4%/ +33.3%, respectively. XYZ Valuations Seeking Alpha These reasons may also be why XYZ's valuations appear rather expensive at FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations of 24.36x, up from the April 2025 bottom of 11.17x, the 1Y mean of 18.12x, and the sector median of 11x, albeit still somewhat reasonable when compared to its profitable fintech peers, including SoFi ( SOFI ) at 73.77x and PayPal ( PYPL ) at 14.34x. Based on the current FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations to 24.36x and the 3Y adj EPS growth estimates at a 3Y CAGR of +27.4%, from the FQ1'25 annualized adj EPS of $2.24 to the consensus FY2027 adj EPS estimates of $4.64, we are looking at a relatively cheap FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.88x. When compared to its fintech peers, including SOFI at 0.93x and PYPL at 1.62x, it is apparent that XYZ remains rather compelling here, assuming that the latter's growth initiatives work out as expected. So, Is XYZ Stock A Buy , Sell, or Hold? XYZ 3Y Stock Price Trading View For now, the bulls have already defended XYZ's new floor at the $48s range by May 2025, up from the $42s observed in October 2023, with the stock seemingly retesting the $69s resistance levels after breaking out of the 50/ 100 day moving averages. XYZ's Mixed Technical Indicators Trading View Based on the mixed historical trends and technical indicators above (red and blue), it remains to be seen if XYZ may be able to sustain its upward movement moving forward. Readers must note the notably higher short interest volumes by +63.2% on a YoY basis and the greedy stock market sentiments , with it implying further volatility in the near-term, depending on the fintech's FQ2'25 earnings results on August 7, 2025, and the results of the cryptocurrency bill . Based on XYZ's FQ1'25 annualized adj EPS of $2.24 and the 1Y mean of 18.12x, it is apparent that the stock is trading at a notable premium to our base-case fair value estimates of $40.50. Even so, based on the consensus FY2027 adj EPS estimates of $4.64, there appears to be an excellent upside potential of +21.6% to our base-case long-term price target of $84. Based on the current FWD P/E non-GAAP valuations of 24.36x (nearer to its peer group mean of ~30x), it is apparent that the stock continues to offer an excellent upside potential of +63.6% to our bull-case long-term price target of $113, despite the rich double-digit recovery from the May 2025 bottom. As a result of the bullish uptrend support observed in its stock performance, the management's promising commentaries in the recent conference, and the double-digit upside potential, we are reiterating our Buy rating for the XYZ stock. This is with the caveat that interested investors observe the stock price movement for a little longer before adding, preferably nearer to the 50/ 100 day moving averages of ~$60s ranges for an improved margin of safety and a lower dollar cost average. At the same time, while XYZ may have offered a promising commentary surrounding their April and early May 2025 performance, investors should also temper their near-term expectations, since it remains to be seen if the same cadence may be carried through Q2'25 and Q3'25.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801837-block-hints-at-q2-2025-double-beat-performance-bitcoin-bet-appears-promising?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT","XYZ",cryptocompare
2025-07-17T14:40:54,"Dollar Rebound: Navigating Market Volatility Amidst Powell‚Äôs Uncertain Future","BitcoinWorld Dollar Rebound: Navigating Market Volatility Amidst Powell‚Äôs Uncertain Future The cryptocurrency market, often seen as a rebellion against traditional finance, is nonetheless profoundly influenced by macro-economic shifts, none more so than the strength or weakness of the US Dollar. Recently, the Dollar has staged a surprising Dollar rebound , sending ripples of uncertainty across global financial markets, including digital assets. This unexpected surge, coupled with growing doubts surrounding the future leadership of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has injected a fresh wave of market volatility , leaving investors on edge. What exactly is driving this sudden shift, and what does it mean for your portfolio? The Surprising Dollar Rebound: What‚Äôs Behind It? The recent Dollar rebound has caught many by surprise, especially those who had anticipated a continued weakening of the greenback. Several factors appear to be converging to fuel this resurgence. Primarily, global economic uncertainties, from geopolitical tensions to concerns about growth in other major economies, have driven investors towards the US Dollar as a traditional safe-haven asset. When the world feels unstable, the Dollar often shines as a secure place for capital. Furthermore, stronger-than-expected economic data emerging from the United States has played a crucial role. Robust employment figures, resilient consumer spending, and manufacturing upticks suggest that the US economy might be weathering global headwinds better than initially feared. This narrative of relative strength makes US assets, and by extension the Dollar, more attractive to international investors seeking stability and potential returns. Finally, interest rate differentials remain a key driver. While other central banks might be signaling a more dovish stance, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs commitment to tackling inflation, even if tempered, has maintained a higher yield environment for Dollar-denominated assets compared to many of its peers. This interest rate advantage provides a compelling reason for capital to flow into the US, bolstering the Dollar rebound and reinforcing its position as a preferred currency for carry trades and stable investments. Powell‚Äôs Future: A Cloud of Uncertainty Over Federal Reserve Policy Much of the current unease in the markets stems from speculation surrounding Powell‚Äôs future as the head of the Federal Reserve. Rumors and discussions about his potential reappointment, or lack thereof, have introduced a significant layer of uncertainty into the outlook for Federal Reserve policy . Why is this so critical? The Fed Chair‚Äôs stance on monetary policy ‚Äì particularly interest rates, quantitative easing, and inflation targets ‚Äì has profound implications for everything from bond yields to equity valuations, and yes, even cryptocurrency prices. A change in leadership could signal a fundamental shift in the Fed‚Äôs approach to inflation, employment, and overall economic management. For instance, a more hawkish successor might push for higher interest rates, which could further strengthen the Dollar but potentially dampen risk appetite for assets like Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Conversely, a more dovish appointee might ease monetary policy, potentially weakening the Dollar but supporting risk assets by increasing liquidity. The lack of clarity on Powell‚Äôs future keeps investors guessing, contributing directly to market jitters and making long-term planning difficult. The market thrives on predictability, and the current ambiguity around the top central banking role in the world‚Äôs largest economy is the antithesis of that. This uncertainty directly impacts expectations for future Federal Reserve policy , making it challenging for investors to position their portfolios effectively and leading to reactive rather than proactive trading behaviors. Navigating the Tides of Market Volatility: What Investors Need to Know The interplay between the Dollar rebound and the uncertainty surrounding Powell‚Äôs future has predictably led to heightened market volatility . Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. In simpler terms, it means prices are swinging up and down more dramatically and frequently than usual. This environment can be both a challenge and an opportunity for investors, depending on their strategy and risk appetite. Key drivers of current market volatility include: Policy Uncertainty: As discussed, the lack of clarity on the Fed‚Äôs future direction keeps markets on edge, leading to rapid re-pricing of assets as new information emerges. Economic Data Surprises: Strong US data can lead to rapid repricing of interest rate expectations, causing sudden shifts in currency valuations and equity markets. Geopolitical Events: Ongoing global tensions, conflicts, or trade disputes can trigger flight-to-safety moves, impacting currency pairs and risk assets as capital seeks refuge. Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation pressures keep central banks globally on a tightening path, even if gradually, leading to rate hike expectations and currency strength, which can induce sudden market reactions. For cryptocurrency investors, market volatility in traditional finance often spills over. A stronger Dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other digital assets, as investors might rotate out of perceived riskier assets into safer havens. However, crypto markets also have their own unique drivers, and sometimes volatility in traditional markets can push investors towards crypto as an alternative, non-correlated asset. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions in a fluctuating environment. The US Dollar Outlook: What Lies Ahead? Predicting the exact trajectory of the Dollar is challenging, but understanding the key factors influencing the US Dollar outlook can help investors prepare for various scenarios. The Dollar‚Äôs future strength will largely depend on a few critical variables that dictate global capital flows and risk perceptions: Inflation Trends: If US inflation remains stubbornly high, the Federal Reserve might be compelled to maintain a tighter monetary policy for longer, supporting the Dollar. Conversely, a rapid decline in inflation could give the Fed more room to ease, potentially weakening the Dollar as interest rate differentials narrow. Global Economic Growth: A synchronized global economic recovery, especially in major economies outside the US, could reduce the Dollar‚Äôs appeal as a safe haven, leading to its depreciation as capital flows into other growth opportunities. However, if other major economies falter, the Dollar could continue to attract capital. Federal Reserve Actions: The actual decisions made by the Fed regarding interest rates and its balance sheet will be paramount. Any deviation from market expectations, whether a more hawkish stance or a surprisingly dovish pivot, will significantly impact the US Dollar outlook and global asset prices. Geopolitical Stability: Continued global instability or new crises could trigger further safe-haven demand for the Dollar, reinforcing its strength regardless of internal US economic conditions. The current US Dollar outlook suggests a period of continued choppiness and responsiveness to incoming data and policy signals. While the recent rebound shows its resilience and enduring appeal, the underlying uncertainties ‚Äì especially regarding Fed leadership and global economic health ‚Äì mean that rapid shifts are possible. Investors should remain agile and monitor these macroeconomic indicators closely to adapt their strategies. Impact on Cryptocurrency and Global Markets: Adapting to Change The ripple effects of a strengthening Dollar and uncertain Federal Reserve policy extend far beyond just the forex markets. For cryptocurrency investors, a robust Dollar can present both headwinds and tailwinds. Historically, a stronger Dollar has often correlated with a weaker Bitcoin, as investors seek safety in traditional assets and reduce exposure to perceived riskier ones. However, as the crypto market matures and institutional adoption grows, its correlation with traditional finance is becoming more nuanced and less predictable. Emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to a strong Dollar. Many developing nations hold Dollar-denominated debt, and a rising Dollar makes these debts more expensive to service, potentially leading to financial instability, capital flight, and even sovereign defaults. This can, in turn, create broader global economic stress that eventually feeds back into all asset classes, including crypto, through reduced liquidity and risk aversion. Conversely, a Dollar that is too strong can also hurt US exports, making American goods more expensive abroad and potentially dampening corporate earnings for multinational companies. This could eventually prompt the Fed to consider a more dovish stance to support economic growth, which could then reverse the Dollar‚Äôs trajectory and potentially provide a tailwind for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Understanding these interconnected dynamics is key to navigating the current complex financial landscape. Actionable Insights: Strategies for a Volatile Environment In an environment marked by a surprising Dollar rebound and significant market volatility , what can investors do to protect and potentially grow their portfolios? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across different asset classes, including traditional stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risk. Diversification helps cushion the impact of downturns in any single asset class. Stay Informed on Federal Reserve Policy: Closely follow announcements, minutes from meetings, and speeches from the Federal Reserve officials. Understanding their stance on inflation, employment, and interest rates is paramount for predicting market movements and adjusting your strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility over time by averaging your purchase price, reducing the risk of buying at a peak. Assess Risk Tolerance: Volatility can be stressful and lead to emotional decisions. Understand your personal risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile assets. Look for Relative Strength: In currencies, identify which economies are showing relative strength and stability. In crypto, look for projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, and robust development teams that can weather market downturns and emerge stronger. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are common and often noisy. A long-term investment horizon can help you ride out periods of high volatility and focus on the overall growth trajectory of your chosen assets, rather than reacting to daily price swings. These strategies can help investors navigate the complex interplay of a strong Dollar and evolving Federal Reserve policy , turning potential challenges into opportunities for growth and stability. Summary: Navigating the Complexities of a Shifting Financial Landscape The recent Dollar rebound , driven by safe-haven demand, robust US economic data, and favorable interest rate differentials, has introduced a significant layer of complexity to global financial markets. This strength, combined with the profound uncertainty surrounding Powell‚Äôs future at the helm of the Federal Reserve, has amplified market volatility across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. These interconnected forces demand careful attention from all market participants. The evolving US Dollar outlook hinges on crucial factors like persistent inflation trends, the trajectory of global economic growth, and the precise future direction of Federal Reserve policy . While the Dollar‚Äôs resilience is evident, the underlying currents of uncertainty suggest that agility, informed decision-making, and a clear understanding of macroeconomic forces will be paramount for investors in the coming months. As we‚Äôve explored, understanding these macroeconomic forces is not just for forex traders; it directly impacts the performance of your crypto portfolio and broader investment strategies. By staying informed, diversifying, and adopting a long-term perspective, investors can better position themselves to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by this fascinating and often unpredictable financial landscape, turning uncertainty into a potential advantage.

That said, ‚Äúas the infrastructure matures and innovation thrives, Bitcoin is poised to become far more than a store of value.‚Äù Innovations within Bitcoin DeFi are laying the groundwork for this transformation, Harz says. This will enable institutions to hold Bitcoin, but also to put the coins to work through DeFi applications. ‚ÄúThe next chapter for Bitcoin, and indeed digital assets, moves past price speculation and towards genuine utility opportunities. And where the institutional money flows, innovation follows.‚Äù Harz also commented on the current Crypto Week happening in the US, describing it as a historic moment for Bitcoin and crypto in general. He continues: ‚ÄúWith BTC breaking past $122,000 over the weekend, a new all-time high, the price is reflecting the convergence of increased institutional inflows, growing confidence in digital assets as foundational infrastructure, and importantly, a call for regulatory clarity.‚Äù Therefore, Crypto Week shows ‚Äúa consolidated push towards alignment on a framework that empowers innovation through clarity; the kind of innovation that will unlock blockchain‚Äôs true potential. Bitcoin DeFi, in particular, remains the industry‚Äôs greatest opportunity,‚Äù Harz concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,085. Yet again, the coin saw choppy 24 hours of trading. It began this period with $118,186, rising to the daily high of $120,008. It has been decreasing since, however, moving back towards the intraday low. The market watchers are now waiting for the price to reestablish itself within the $120,000 territory and hold it.

It started at $3,162, decreased slightly to the intraday low of $3,148, before rising to its current level, which is also its daily high. Notably, the next major upside targets are $3,454 and $3,757. However, market participants are also eyeing the $4,000 mark, which has now entered the realm of possibility. Additionally, ETH surpassing the $3,280 mark for the first time since February placed it less than 10% away from breaking out of a four-year channel that restrained it from reaching its ATH of $4,891, recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment still stands firmly in greed territory. The Fear and Greed Index increased from 68 yesterday to 70 today . It suggests a willingness to invest and a positive view of the market. Further increases could suggest that the market is becoming overbought. Furthermore, on 16 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw additional positive flows. This marks the tenth day in a row. Inflows reached $788.4 million , nearly double than a day before. Moreover, this is the record-high amount, significantly surpassing the previous $428.44 million. With that, the total net inflows hit $6.48 billion. BlackRock saw the highest share of this amount again, recording $763.89 million. Ark & 21 Shares , Fidelity , and Grayscale account for the rest. At the same time, US ETH ETFs saw positive flows for the ninth day in a row, recording a whopping $726.74 million on 16 July. Of this amount, BlackRock recorded $499.25 million, and Fidelity took in $113.31 million. Six other funds saw inflows. There were no outflows again. Meanwhile, Tom Lee, chief investment officer at Fundstrat and chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies , argued that the growth of stablecoins, in addition to Wall Street‚Äôs tokenization of real-world assets, is fueling interest in the Ethereum blockchain .

At this point, Bitcoin is moving into a consolidation phase after reaching a new all-time high, while ETH is now taking the lead. Every Drop in Ethereum Is an Opportunity! As Ethereum continues its rapid rise, popular analyst Michael van de Poppe argued that Ethereum‚Äôs momentum after testing multiple resistances could push the price up to $4,000, last seen in December. Poppe also stated that Ethereum is ready to rise to higher prices, and that every subsequent decline is a buying opportunity. ‚ÄúI think Ethereum will head towards $4,000. So, if there are any corrections coming, it would be great to capitalize on them and buy on dips.‚Äù In another post, Poppe pointed out that Ethereum has gained even more value against Bitcoin, and that this is a sign that the next phase, the altcoin season, is about to begin. The analyst finally emphasized that altcoins generally follow the trend of altcoin leader Ethereum and that altcoins could soon initiate an explosive price movement. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-17T14:01:51,"Analyst Predicts the Exact Timing of the Next Altcoin Season","TL;DR As BTC retreats slightly from its $123K peak, top altcoins like ETH and XRP continue to surge. One analyst believes the altseason may begin as early as this week, drawing comparisons to patterns observed in previous bull cycles. Is It Finally Here? Less than a week ago, bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high price of approximately $123,000. Since then, though , the primary cryptocurrency has cooled off slightly, giving room for some of the leading altcoins to record substantial gains , too . Over the past few days, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) , Stellar (XLM), Cardano (ADA), and many more have taken center stage thanks to their rapid price increases, while BTC‚Äôs dominance has slipped below 61%. BTC Dominance, Source: CMC These developments have led many in the crypto community to speculate that the altseason has either already begun or is just around the corner. One popular X user who shared their thoughts on the matter is 0xNobler. The analyst claimed the next altcoin season could start tomorrow (July 18), arguing that the same thing was observed in 2017 and 2021: ‚ÄúEvery altseason started on the same day, and this one won‚Äôt be any different.‚Äù The X user suggested that the market is still in its early phase of an uptrend, with most capital concentrated in BTC and high-cap coins. Later, however, the interest could shift to smaller cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization, while the dominance of the leader might continue to decline. ‚ÄúIf this setup continues, the altcoin season could kick off next week, offering the best entry point. I‚Äôve witnessed this pattern in past cycles, and recognizing it early changed everything,‚Äù the analyst added. Additionally, 0xNobler said they would accumulate several cryptocurrencies ahead of the next rally. Some of the well-known names include Hyperliquid (HYPE), Sui (SUI), Render (RENDER), and more . More Opinions Davinci Jeremie, a popular figure in the crypto space, widely known for urging people to buy BTC when its price was under $1, believes the altcoin season hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. However, he cautioned that when it starts, most will be too late. Altseason hasn‚Äôt started. But when it‚Äôs here, most will be too late. ‚Äî Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) July 17, 2025 For his part, the veteran trader Peter Brandt argued that it‚Äôs already altseason. His thesis is based on the formation of a classical ‚Äúcup with handle‚Äù on the chart, which shows the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC.

2025-07-17T14:00:25,"Explosive Shift: Bitcoin Dominance Plunges as Altcoins Soar, Igniting Retail Enthusiasm","BitcoinWorld Explosive Shift: Bitcoin Dominance Plunges as Altcoins Soar, Igniting Retail Enthusiasm The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed energy, signaling a significant shift in dynamics that has captivated investors worldwide. For weeks, the market has been consolidating, but recent movements indicate a potential changing of the guard, at least temporarily. What exactly is unfolding, and what does it mean for your portfolio? Understanding the Shift in Bitcoin Dominance For a long time, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king of crypto, its market capitalization often dictating the overall sentiment and direction of the broader digital asset space. This metric, known as Bitcoin dominance , measures BTC‚Äôs market cap as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. When Bitcoin dominance falls, it typically suggests that altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin, often signaling the start of an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô. Recent data from on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X highlights this very phenomenon: Bitcoin dominance has slipped below the 63% mark. This isn‚Äôt just a minor fluctuation; it‚Äôs a significant indicator that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift can be a thrilling period for investors, offering opportunities beyond the traditional market leader. The Ascent of Ethereum Price and Its Impact Leading the charge among the altcoins is Ethereum (ETH), which has impressively climbed above the $3,400 mark. Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various layer-2 solutions, makes it a natural magnet for capital when investors look beyond Bitcoin. The strength of the Ethereum price is often seen as a bellwether for the broader altcoin market, and its current trajectory suggests a healthy appetite for smart contract platforms and their associated tokens. Ethereum‚Äôs continued development, including ongoing upgrades aimed at scalability and efficiency, reinforces its position as a foundational layer for the decentralized web. As more projects build on Ethereum and its layer-2 networks, demand for ETH, which powers these transactions, naturally increases. This sustained interest in Ethereum is a key driver for the current market sentiment. The Broadening Altcoin Rally : Beyond ETH While Ethereum leads the pack, the excitement isn‚Äôt confined to just ETH. Prices of major altcoins across the board are trending upward, indicating a widespread altcoin rally . This includes everything from established large-cap altcoins to emerging projects and even the more speculative memecoins. The diversification of capital flow suggests a growing confidence in the overall crypto market, with investors willing to explore higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. This period of broad market participation is often characterized by: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into various projects. Sector Rotation: Investors moving funds from one crypto sector to another based on performance. New All-Time Highs: Many altcoins may start breaking previous resistance levels. Even memecoins, known for their volatile and community-driven price action, are experiencing significant upward momentum. While inherently risky, their participation in the rally underscores the speculative fervor returning to the market. Decoding the Crypto Fear Greed Index Market sentiment is a powerful force in cryptocurrency, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for gauging it. This index analyzes various market factors, including volatility, market momentum, social media sentiment, and trading volume, to produce a score from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). After nearly two weeks of sustained gains across the market, the Crypto Fear Greed Index has climbed to 73. A score of 73 falls squarely in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô territory. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and are more inclined to buy, often driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO). While ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô can be a sign of a healthy bull market, it also serves as a cautionary signal. Historically, extreme greed levels can precede market corrections, as prices may become overextended. However, in the current context, it primarily reflects the widespread positive sentiment and belief in continued upward momentum. The Return of Retail Enthusiasm Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the current market surge is the noticeable return of retail enthusiasm . After periods of consolidation or downturns, retail investors often step back, waiting for clearer signs of recovery. The current rally, particularly the performance of altcoins and the rise in the Fear & Greed Index, suggests that individual investors are re-engaging with the market. This renewed interest manifests in several ways: Increased Trading Volume: More participants buying and selling. Social Media Buzz: Heightened discussions and positive sentiment across platforms. New Wallet Creations: More individuals entering the crypto space. Retail participation is crucial for sustaining a bull market, as it brings fresh capital and broadens the investor base beyond institutional players. Their collective energy often fuels the most explosive phases of a rally, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of optimism and price appreciation. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges The current market environment presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. The benefits of an altcoin rally are clear: the potential for significant gains, portfolio diversification, and the discovery of innovative projects. However, it‚Äôs also a time for caution: Volatility: Altcoins, especially memecoins, can experience rapid price swings. Risk Management: It‚Äôs crucial to invest only what you can afford to lose and to consider taking profits. Research: Not all projects will succeed; thorough due diligence is essential. For those looking to capitalize on this shift, a balanced approach is often recommended. While the allure of high-flying altcoins is strong, maintaining a core position in more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum can provide stability. Diversifying across different sectors within the altcoin market can also mitigate risk. A Compelling Outlook The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a fascinating transformation, with Bitcoin dominance yielding ground to a surging altcoin market led by a robust Ethereum price . This widespread altcoin rally , fueled by a rising Crypto Fear Greed Index and the palpable return of retail enthusiasm , paints a picture of a market brimming with opportunity. While the journey in crypto is always unpredictable, the current momentum suggests a period of vibrant activity and potential growth. As always, informed decisions and a strategic approach will be key to navigating these exciting times.

2025-07-17T14:00:13,"US Marshalls Own 85% Less Bitcoin Than Believed, FOIA Reveals","A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in March has shed new light on the scale of Bitcoin holdings under the control of the US Marshals Service (USMS). According to the documents obtained by independent journalist L0la L33tz, the agency currently holds exactly 28,988.35643016 BTC, placing its value at approximately $1.6 billion based on the valuation provided in the disclosure. However, the USMS figures appear to be based on a BTC price of $56,000 per coin, while the market is currently trading near $119,000‚Äîmore than double that estimate. Only 28,988 Bitcoin Left? L33tz, who published the findings on X, emphasized that the disclosure came directly from the USMS in response to a formal FOIA request. ‚ÄúIn March, we filed a FOIA request for the amount of bitcoin held by the US Marshal Service. Today, we publish the USMS answer to our FOIA request, as well as the list of bitcoin it holds, totaling 28,988.35643016 BTC,‚Äù she wrote. The request was dated March 24, and the response was received on July 16. The revelation quickly triggered debate across the community. Prominent industry figures reacted with a mix of surprise and criticism, noting that the holdings are far lower than many had assumed. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a longtime advocate in Congress, expressed alarm: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alarmed by reports that the US has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves‚Äîleaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race.‚Äù David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who had previously offered $10,000 to any journalist who could confirm the government‚Äôs BTC holdings, praised the scoop and confirmed the payment to L33tz after verifying the documents. ‚ÄúIt looks like we might know how many Bitcoin the US government is holding now and it‚Äôs about 85% less than thought. Explains why the price action was stuck for so long. Bullish,‚Äù Bailey commented on X. He later added, ‚ÄúIf Biden sold all our Bitcoin on his way out the door, Trump is going to buy them back 2x over lmao. Mega bullish.‚Äù L33tz used the opportunity to clarify a key distinction often misunderstood in public discourse: the difference between seized assets and forfeited assets. She explained, ‚ÄúThe USMS is mainly in charge of forfeited assets, meaning assets that have been made property of the Government. The list I received from the USMS is a list of all BTC held by the USMS, as requested by DB. The USMS can be in charge of seized assets, but these can also be held with seizing agencies, like the DEA or the FBI‚Äîmeaning that there may be other custody offices than the USMS.‚Äù This nuance is critical because many market observers had relied on on-chain analytics platforms such as Arkham or databases like Bitcoin Treasuries to estimate US government holdings. However, L33tz noted these sources likely overstate actual government-owned Bitcoin because they track seized assets, not those formally forfeited and available for liquidation. ‚ÄúTo the geniuses that have linked Arkham‚Äôs gov wallet tracker: these do not seem to be BTC that have been made the Gov‚Äôs property‚Äîat least not exclusively‚Äîwhich means they can‚Äôt sell them. For example, Arkham lists 94k BTC from the Bitfinex hack, but forfeiture in the Bitfinex case hasn‚Äôt been decided, at least last time I checked,‚Äù she wrote. The FOIA disclosure also sheds light on the operational process. The USMS has historically managed forfeited digital assets and liquidated them via public auctions, a practice dating back to the early days of BTC when the agency sold coins from the Silk Road seizures . L33tz stated, ‚ÄúUS Marshal Service liquidates assets in public auctions, so unless they announced a sale, this list should be accurate.‚Äù This suggests the current holdings represent coins awaiting auction rather than active strategic reserves. The findings have also reignited speculation about possible covert sales by the Biden administration during the transition period. Executive Director of the Bitcoin Policy Institute Matthew Pines remarked via X, ‚ÄúGreat work by Lola, which if true, confirms my suspicion that the Biden admin was covertly selling OTC during the transition. Note: my understanding is the total BTC in USG possession is significantly larger than this number but its origin & present disposition is classified.‚Äù Others, like Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Alex Thorn, cautioned against assuming the FOIA response captures the entire picture of federal BTC holdings. ‚ÄúThis is great journalistic work from L0la, but I want to note that the US Marshals Asset Forfeiture Division is very likely not the only agency that possesses bitcoin on behalf of the US government, whether for asset forfeiture generally or in light of the SBR,‚Äù Thorn noted, referring to ongoing discussions about a potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Beyond the numbers, the implications for the broader market narrative are significant. The assumption that the US government held almost 200,000 BTC has long shaped perceptions of a massive starting stash for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under the Trump administration. If, as the FOIA response suggests, the government‚Äôs liquid Bitcoin stockpile is a fraction of those estimates, the perceived overhang may be far less material than traders believed. Vijay Boyapati captured this sentiment succinctly: ‚ÄúIncredible. The US government holds less Bitcoin than an individual who just dumped 40,000 BTC in the last few days. The idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is laughable when individuals own more Bitcoin than the US government.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $118,279.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/us-marshalls-85-less-bitcoin-than-believed-foia/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price",cryptocompare

Based on this development, SHIB looks well primed for a parabolic rally, which could happen soon. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Exchange Reserves Hit Lowest Level Since 2023 CryptoQuant data shows that Shiba Inu‚Äôs exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level since January 2023. This metric refers to the amount of SHIB that is held in wallets linked to crypto exchanges. As such, the drop in these reserves indicates that there has been a massive accumulation by whales who have been moving coins to cold storage for long-term holding. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breakout Programmed: Diamond Hands Are Up 783%, SHIB Burn Rate Explodes 1,784% This development is significant as a price surge could follow, with Shiba Inu rallying to new highs. In 2023, as the exchange reserves began to decline, SHIB witnessed a God candle, which sent its price above the psychological $0.00003 level. The meme coin surged from a low of around $0.000007 back then. IntoTheBlock data also shows that Shiba Inu whales are back to accumulating SHIB, which could spark this rally as demand outweighs supply. Over the last week, SHIB‚Äôs largest transactions have been steadily climbing from the lows recorded in June when the meme coin fell to the support level at $0.000010. It is also worth noting that Shiba Inu‚Äôs correlation with Bitcoin is 0.92, indicating a strong positive correlation between the two assets. As such, the meme coin could also skyrocket as the leading crypto targets new all-time highs (ATHs). BTC is looking to reclaim the $120,000 psychological level, a development which could help SHIB maintain its momentum as it rallies towards $0.000020. Another Rally To $0.000030 In Sight For SHIB In an X post, crypto analyst Javon Marks confirmed that Shiba Inu is eyeing another rally to $0.000030. He stated that in the short term and based on confirmed data, SHIB is expected to reach the $0.000032 level in response to a bullish divergence. The analyst noted that this move itself is over 135% and could only be the start of a larger bullish reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence The analyst had earlier revealed that Shiba Inu had confirmed a clear bullish divergence on its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Marks further remarked that this development points to a nearly 180% upside, which would send the meme coin back to around $0.000032. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Investing Haven also confirmed that the targets of $0.000044 to $0.000066 remain valid for the top meme coin. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001439, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
