2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitfinex margin longs dropped from 80,387 BTC to 65,889 BTC between April 16 and May 16. This shift marks a reversal from the strong bullish margin demand seen between mid-February and mid-March, a period when Bitcoin’s price fell from $97,600 to $82,500. The current decrease in margin longs is likely a sign of healthy profit-taking rather than a turn toward bearish momentum.The reasoning behind this move is not entirely clear, since Bitcoin’s jump above $100,000 occurred on May 8, about three weeks after the margin longs peaked.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($99,416) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone signal that bulls remain in control.

If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($90,628).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) pullback is finding support at the breakout level of $2,550, signaling that every minor dip is being purchased.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $2,750, the ETH/USDT pair could resume its up move.

A break below it could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($2,225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has reached the resistance line after turning down from the overhead resistance of $2.65 on May 14.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price dips below the resistance line, it suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. That increases the likelihood of a range-bound action between $2.65 and $2 for a few days.Conversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line signals that the bulls are attempting to flip the level into support. Sellers may pose a solid challenge at $2.65, but if the bulls prevail, the XRP/USDT pair could reach $3.BNB price predictionBuyers have successfully defended the $644 level in BNB (BNB), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests that the bears have kept up the pressure.BNB/USDT daily chart.

The BNB/USDT pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($604).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) is facing stiff resistance at $180, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($161) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that buyers are in command.

Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the $5 to $5.37 zone.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the pair down to $3.12.Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) has turned down from the resistance line of the descending channel pattern, implying that the bears are selling on rallies.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA minor positive is that the bulls have successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($15.56). Buyers will again attempt to thrust the price above the resistance line. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $19.80 and then to $21.30.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price plummets below the neckline. The pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA ($14), which is a crucial support to watch out for. A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 20-day EMA ($22.78) on May 15, indicating buying on dips.AVAX/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-16T15:00:00.000Z,"From debanking to a banking arms race—The rise of stablecoins","Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin PayrollThere are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. It is imperative that the banking industry stop shunning crypto and start — at least understanding it — to stay competitive. How stablecoins are deployed will separate the banking winners and losers. From debanking to stablecoins Of course, stablecoins are not a new concept. For years, large institutions like JPMorgan and Santander have experimented with stablecoins and blockchains. Those experiments were around small functions like internal treasury reconciliation and interbank settlement. Much of this was also on private blockchains created by those banks. Implementing digital dollars on private chains, however, misses out on the core innovation of stablecoins.While the use case of stablecoins for international remittances is clear, we are just scratching the surface of the power of stablecoins on public networks. For example, stablecoins eradicate unauthorized payment disputes and enable far faster pay cycles. Payroll payments are also complex. Payday is a web of thousands of automated clearing houses, wires, comma-separated values and PDFs. The programmability of stablecoins enables companies to create efficiency among all these data structures, processing times, reconciliations and paycheck reporting. Many smaller banks are just now waking up to the opportunity to incorporate permissionless, public network stablecoins into their workflows. Similar to how many businesses started to investigate how AI might change their businesses with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, so too are banks needing to look at how stablecoins will upend money movement. Recently, Custodia Bank issued its own stablecoin, Avit, on Ethereum. Custodia’s users can access quick, cheap banking services that are hard to beat. This is an excellent example of implementation for other financial institutions to follow.Stablecoin adoption is increasing as the tech keeps improvingActive stablecoin wallets increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to over 30 million in February 2025, according to Artemis and Dune. US President Donald Trump hopes to have stablecoin legislation on his desk by August 2025. Wyoming already did so in late March 2025.Recent: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsStablecoin infrastructure has improved significantly, and there is increased confidence in the security of stablecoins. 91% of the supply of stablecoins is fiat-backed, and only 8.5% are backed by collateralized crypto assets. Riskier algorithmic stablecoins have gone out of vogue.Incremental changes also make it easier for non-crypto businesses to use stablecoins. There are now simple solutions for many of the original UX problems with stablecoins.Additionally, more assets are moving onchain. Using stablecoins on public networks like Ethereum, payment companies will be better prepared to serve the future financial system. It’s not just stablecoins that are updating the financial system, either. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Squawk Box he wants the SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks.”For banks looking for a competitive advantage in a world of powerful fintechs, shifting interest rates and lower consumer savings, using the power of stablecoins to improve their products and their internal operations might be the most powerful decision they make. Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin Payroll.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-16T14:30:00.000Z,"Europe’s MiCA law is motion, but can the crypto industry keep up?","The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines approaching, firms are being forced to act quickly.Stablecoins at bayOne of MiCA’s earliest and most controversial provisions involves stablecoins. Under the law, no stablecoin can be offered to EU users unless the issuer is authorized in the EU and publishes a regulator-approved white paper.Strict rules around asset reserves, governance, conflict of interest and marketing are also part of the package. Issuers are even banned from offering interest on tokens, removing a common incentive for adoption.Related: Stablecoin regulation next ‘catalyst’ for crypto industry — Aptos headThe world’s most-used stablecoin — Tether’s USDt (USDT) — has already announced it won’t seek MiCA compliance, meaning exchanges may soon be forced to delist it across the EU. This has major implications for liquidity, retail access and DeFi activity in the region.Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson at Token 2049:“The reason is not, uh, fear of regulations, fear of compliance… The problem that I had with um, with MiCA is that [the] license is very dangerous when it comes to stablecoins and I believe that it's even more dangerous for the small medium banking system in Europe.”Compliance is keyOn the flip side, other firms are leaning in. BitGo, a crypto custody firm, recently secured a MiCA-aligned license in Germany, positioning itself to serve institutional players across Europe. Brett Reeves, head of Go Network and European Sales at BitGo, told Cointelegraph the license is not just about compliance, but long-term strategic alignment with Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape.“We found that both BaFin and the European regulators have been relatively straightforward to deal with. Sometimes they have difficult questions, but they're there to make sure that our processes are in place and up to scratch.”We also spoke with Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, who emphasized the need for consistent national-level interpretation and better guidance from regulators to prevent fragmentation.Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-16T14:22:30.000Z,"Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors","As cryptocurrency gains in popularity and price, some criminals are taking to violent measures to steal funds from high-profile crypto holders.Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high-profile attacks this year.Ledger founder and wife kidnapped, freedThe founder of crypto wallet Ledger, David Balland, and his wife, Amandine Balland, were kidnapped from their home on Jan. 21. The couple was put in a car, then separated and held at different locations. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the kidnappers called an executive at Ledger and demanded a substantial ransom to be paid in cryptocurrencies. They reportedly mutilated Balland’s hand and sent Ledger a photograph to put pressure on the company.Some 230 officers participated in the search after Ledger alerted authorities. The police managed to locate and free David on Jan. 22 in Châteauroux, 30 miles southwest of his residence. One day later, after questioning arrested suspects and analyzing phone records, police were able to locate and rescue Amandine in Étampes, 80 miles north of Vierzon.A small portion of the ransom was paid. Beccuau said it was frozen and tracked, leading to the arrest of nine men and one woman. Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier released a statement after Balland was rescued.

After a test drive, they stopped at a spa, supposedly to meet with JC’s lawyer. Three other men forced Kim into another vehicle and bound his hands. Kim was kept for three days. Then, the attackers abandoned him some 50 kilometers away, his hands still tied, where police officers found him.The perpetrators didn’t manage to get his crypto, but they stole his car, his Rolex watch, his wallet and the keys to his house. Streamer shoots would-be crypto thievesIn November 2024, Kick streamer and cosplayer Kaitlyn Siragusa, known professionally as “Amouranth,” posted a screenshot on X of her crypto wallet. It held some $20 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Months later, on March 2, 2025, three armed assailants allegedly broke into her home with the intent of stealing her cryptocurrency. She posted during the incident on X, stating, “I’m being too robbed at gunpont. I believe I shot one of them they wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed.”Siragusa claimed that the assailants physically assaulted her before she discharged a weapon, after which they fled the scene. She said that police were testing blood left by suspects at the scene and posted video of the incident on her X profile. Kidnappers demand $50 million in crypto from Spanish businessmanOn March 29, police in São Paulo arrested a retired military police officer in connection with the week-long kidnapping of a Spanish businessman. Speaking to authorities, the businessman said he was approached by two men dressed in fake civil police uniforms and forced into a truck. Upon reaching a secluded location on the outskirts of the city, the assailants held him and demanded $50 million in cryptocurrency.Local media said the kidnappers drugged their victim with sleeping pills, but he was still able to escape when one of them went to the bathroom. After finding a filling station, he tipped off police, who seized one of the suspects as well as a pistol and ammunition. Daughter of crypto exchange owner fights off assailants The daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Paris when passersby intervened.Three masked attackers tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a van while they were taking a walk in Paris on May 13. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

The assailants fled in a van, which was later found abandoned nearby. The victims sustained injuries and were evacuated to a local hospital. Local media reported that the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior, was investigating the incident. Assailants target father of crypto entrepreneurKidnappers in Paris, France abducted the father of a French cryptocurrency entrepreneur on May 4. The attackers took him to Essonne, 35 miles away from the Paris street where they grabbed him, and cut off his finger. They made a video and sent it to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. The victim’s son subsequently contacted police. The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Authorities have noted the striking similarities of the case to that of Balland, whose attackers also took him several miles from the city and mutilated his hand. “Obviously, there’s at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it’s the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde.Authorities seek answers and crypto holders want securityThe rise in recent attacks has shaken the crypto industry. Ben Davis, co-founder and CEO at blockchain insurance firm Native, told Cointelegraph, “We used to see crypto wrench attacks predominantly happening when executives were abroad or traveling. However, high-profile cases like the kidnapping of Ledger’s co-founder show that attackers are now targeting individuals in their own homes, with more planning and precision than ever before.”Authorities are responding to concerns as well. On May 16, the French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with cryptocurrency professionals to address the recent uptick in violent crime against industry figures. For the foreseeable future, personal security, not just asset security, will be a defining theme of the crypto industry. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky WeeAdditional reporting by Cath Jenkin",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Subsequently, Alderoty disclosed on X that the SEC will keep $50 million of the $125 million fine.“The parties have made no effort to satisfy that burden here; their request does not even mention the Rule,” the court document stated.Community asks for explanationAs Alderoty has not provided any details on the nature of procedural concerns by the court, but assured the public that Ripple and the SEC are “fully in agreement to resolve the case,” many in the community were unhappy with the lack of specifics from Ripple.“First, in a recent post about this case, you said you would not be making any more X posts because the case was closed,” one XRP observer responded to Alderoty in the X thread.Source: X thread from Stuart Alderoty“Second, I don’t think it's enough to just say that it’s procedural. I think further explanation of what went wrong in the filing is needed,” one XRP observer wrote in an X thread,” the post continued.Related: Ripple commits $25M to US school nonprofits“Let’s remember that both he and Brad said the case was over, and it still isn’t; they’re cheating us a little,” another user speculated.The news came shortly after online reports suggested that US President Donald Trump was allegedly manipulated by a Ripple-linked lobbyist into announcing the XRP token would be part of his plans for a national cryptocurrency reserve.Many in the Bitcoin (BTC) community have been slamming Ripple for advocating for a multi-coin strategic reserve, instead of a Bitcoin-only reserve.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-win-unaffected-xrp-settlement-denial-court?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Both companies are seemingly set to follow a path similar to the top corporate BTC holder Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy).Sora Ventures joins company boardJason Fang, the founder and managing partner of Sora Ventures, will join AsiaStrategy as a member of its board. He will serve as co-CEO at the firm alongside Tony Ngai (Kwan Ngai), who served as the CEO and director at Top Win until now.Fang started his career at Fenbushi Capital in 2016 and later founded Sora Ventures in 2018. Under his leadership, Sora Ventures invested in decentralized finance (DeFi), game finance (GameFi), social finance (SocialFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

2025-05-16T13:55:35.000Z,"The emergence of Sonic and what it means for DeFi: Report","Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.  Download a full version of the report for free hereSonic’s technical architectureSonic runs on the proprietary SonicVM execution engine, which dynamically translates EVM bytecode into a faster internal format for speedier execution. It also optimizes heavy computations to prevent repeated work and pre-analyzes contract code to cache valid jump destinations. The SonicVM is fully compatible with the EVM, meaning that Fantom smart contracts can run seamlessly on the new blockchain.To address the issue of hefty onchain data storage and slow node synchronization, Sonic uses a new database design called SonicDB. SonicDB separates the blockchain state into two databases. It uses the LiveDB for fast access to the current state and execution, and the ArchiveDB for storing full historical data. This separation allows consensus nodes to cut data storage requirements by up to 90% and thus significantly reduces hardware requirements and synchronization time.For a more comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of Sonic, download the full report for free here. Introducing the S tokenThe Sonic mainnet is powered by a new native token, S. Holders of FTM can convert their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio using the official portal. S remains non-inflationary over the first six months following the mainnet launch in December 2024. Then, 6% of the initial supply will be minted to reward the early users of the blockchain. The full report offers in-depth coverage of several capital-efficient airdrop farming strategies with different risk profiles. Sonic rewards developers as well via its Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) mechanism. Up to 90% of the transaction fees across participating applications are forwarded to developers, while the rest is routed to validators.Becoming a new hub for DeFiAndre Cronje, one of the founders of Fantom and the mastermind behind the Yearn.finance protocol is spearheading DeFi innovation on Sonic. Cronje unveiled Flying Tulip, a new DeFi platform that combines trading, liquidity pools and lending functionalities. The report discusses some innovations Flying Tulip brings to the Sonic blockchain.Flying Tulip is based on the same concept as Curve v2’s dynamic bonding curve. An AMM with a dynamic bonding curve adjusts its curvature based on how close the pool price is to an external price observed by an oracle. It also automatically concentrates the liquidity around the current price, simplifying liquidity management and enhancing capital efficiency. Flying Tulip introduces even faster equilibrium curve updates and narrower ranges alongside other improvements with a novel dynamic loan-to-value model.
