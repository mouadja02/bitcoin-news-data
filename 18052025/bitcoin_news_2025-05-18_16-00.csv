2025-05-18T13:59:17.000Z,"Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Contracting Supply Set to Push Bitcoin past $200K by the End of 2025","Bitcoin can soon cross the $200K mark due to rapidly contracting supply. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, said that the king cryptocurrency can hit the milestone by the end of 2025, considering demand and supply. Hougan’s rationale is that miners can only produce 165,000 $BTC this year. On the other hand, Strategy alone has bought 379,800 $BTC over the past six months. This means that miners can’t produce enough $BTC to satiate the market’s demand. Moreover, a huge amount of money has been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, with the total now standing at $6B. Add to this governments and corporations also buying $BTC left, right, and center, and we’re witnessing an unforeseen demand for the ‘digital gold.’ Hougan expects that $BTC sellers would stop at $100K, which also happens to be a huge psychological level. Keep reading to learn more about Bitcoin’s brewing rally. We’ll also list down the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from this. Shrinking Bitcoin Supply Michael Saylor’s Strategy has emerged as the most aggressive Bitcoin buyer. The company now holds a whopping 568,840 $BTC worth $59.03B. Because of this, the Bitcoin supply has turned deflationary (-2.33%), as per analyst Ki Young Ju. Simply put, Bitcoin’s supply is decreasing by 2.33% every year. Now, with other firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald’s Twenty One also buying Bitcoin aggressively and governments rushing to form a Bitcoin reserve, this deflationary rate is only expected to increase in the next few years. In other words, Bitcoin could become an asset of the rich with limited supply. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin is not expected to stop even after it reaches $200K. Crypto analyst Scott Melker said in a recent interview that the asset can reach $250K by the end of 2025. Heavy corporate investments have meant that Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years. Earlier, it was about three times more volatile than the S&P 500, but it’s now less than twice as volatile. Decreasing volatility is a strong indication of increasing institutional interest. The more money flows into an asset, the less volatile it becomes. If you, too, want to benefit from Bitcoin’s mighty swing upwards, this might be your last chance. If you’re looking for ideas, here are some of the best cryptos to invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth A Bitcoin rally generally means happy times for the broader crypto (and meme coin) market. However, becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will allow you to make the most of Bitcoin’s growth. That’s because $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto today offering real (and free) $BTC via airdrops to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin reaches a landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive their share of $BTC. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250K this year, meaning you can benefit from at least three $BTC airdrops, depending on when BTC Bull Token goes live. The project is currently in presale, with over $5.9M in early investor funding. Luckily for you, one $BTCBULL is available for just $0.00252. It’s also worth noting that the project’s developers have planned to follow a deflationary model. This simply means that the total $BTCBULL supply will keep reducing – every time $BTC’s price jumps $25K, to be precise – which will likely boost demand. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights A booming crypto market is a launchpad for viral meme coins. We’ve already witnessed this in the last couple of weeks, with tokens like $MOODENG, $KEKIUS, and $GOAT recording triple-digit gains.

Buy $MIND now . 3. Department Of Government Efficiency ($DOGE) – Viral Meme Coin Inspired by Musk’s DOGE The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is Elon Musk’s newest infamous initiative. As the name suggests, DOGE’s mission is to assist the second Trump administration by maximizing the productivity of the federal government. Considering that anything Musk touches becomes a fad in crypto, it’s hardly a surprise that $DOGE (not Dogecoin, mind you) has risen to become one of the top trending cryptos . To make the most of its viral bottom line, the $DOGE meme coin offers a few distinct advantages to crypto traders. For instance, you don’t have to pay any fees while buying, selling, or transferring $DOGE. Next, this low-cap coin is now completely owned by the community; the $DOGE owner has given up control over it. $DOGE is up over 140% in the last month or so, including 76% in just the last seven days. It’s currently trading at $0.03318, which, seeing as Trump’s second term is only getting started, could be a great entry point for interested investors. Remember, Even the Best Altcoins Require Sound Risk Management With a Bitcoin rally looking imminent, top altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities thanks to their unique prospects and low prices. However, bear in mind that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you should only risk what you can afford to lose.

This comes after witnessing a week of fluctuations. The rise in Bitcoin’s dominance, in a way, pressured altcoins to perform as retail investors are still absent. However, the stock markets and crypto remained nearly correlated. The ongoing 90-day tariff pause between the US and China has markets within striking distance of their all-time highs. Meanwhile, Moody’s delivered a shock downgrade to the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. It cited soaring deficits and a mounting debt burden. S&P, BTC, gold near ATHs As per the data, S&P 500 is trading at a current price of $5,958 after setting its all-time high of $6,147 on February 19, 2025. It is only 3.27% away from its ATH. Gold is also trading around $3,200 per ounce, after posting its ATH of $3,509 on April 22, 2025. The precious metal is just 9% out from hitting its fresh ATH. A Goldman Sachs report stated that investors have been increasing their holdings of gold since March. It was driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and a surprising surge in demand from central banks. But not all moves have made sense to investors. The recent 5% drop in gold prices , which mirrors a fall in equities, confused some investors. The analyst suggests that gold’s status as a haven asset hasn’t gone anywhere.

Bitcoin hovers near $104K Soft US inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cuts have managed to keep the crypto market up and going. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index also improved market sentiment. Bitcoin price hovered around $103k-$104k over the past week.

After a dour performance during the week, the premier cryptocurrency has continued to trade within the $92,000 – $95,000 range on Saturday, May 17. With the choppy price action, doubt about the Bitcoin price reclaiming its all-time high of $108,786 is starting to creep in. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader could be gearing up for significant price movements over the next few weeks. Open Interest Metric Predicts What’s Next For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Alphractal delved into fresh on-chain observations revolving around the price of Bitcoin and the open interest (OI) cycle. According to the market intelligence firm, the BTC open interest data is exhibiting certain patterns that have coincided with major price moves in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Typically, the open interest metric measures the total amount of money flowing into BTC derivatives at any given period. Meanwhile, the OI Delta indicator estimates changes in the open interest over a specific timeframe. Firstly, Alphractal highlighted that the 30-day Open Interest Delta recently reached the same levels seen during the Bitcoin price rise to its previous all-time high around $73,737 in 2024. This pattern shows that the BTC market could be at the beginning of a cyclical behavioral change. Alphractal said: A familiar pattern is emerging: alternating cycles of increase and decrease in the Open Interest Delta — what we might call Phase 1 and Phase 2. After a strong buildup of positions (positive Delta), we often see a nearly proportional drop (negative Delta), showing clear cyclical behavior in the market. Furthermore, Alphractal noted that the 180-day Open Interest Delta offers a more interesting insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory in the coming weeks. According to the market intelligence firm, a negative 180-day OI Delta metric is usually associated with a market bottom or an accumulation trend. As shown in the chart above, the 180-day Open Interest Delta sits just above the negative territory, which suggests that the Bitcoin price could witness increased volatility in the coming weeks. However, it is worth mentioning that a cross beneath the zero threshold could also signal the start of a new consolidation phase. Alphractal concluded on X: Overall, Open Interest has not grown proportionally like it did from October 2023 to early 2024 — and again from October 2024 into early 2025. These yearly patterns may suggest a fractal behavior in investor risk appetite.

Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative. Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.

According to reports, the woman, in her 40s, carried out the theft while her boyfriend was sleeping. Prosecutors did not reveal the name of the perpetrator during the trial. According to reports , the accused woman stole around 683 million won, worth approximately $488,000. She carried out the theft in January, with the sentencing being carried out this week. During her trial, the woman was also convicted on charges of embezzlement after it was discovered she also stole 2 million won in cash, worth about $1,430. The news was reported by local media in South Korea. South Korean woman sent to jail for crypto theft According to the authorities, the crime occurred at 11:50 PM at her boyfriend’s house in Jeju City, South Korea, on January 5. They said that the woman had carefully memorized her boyfriend’s login details in the hopes that she would access his account when he went to bed. While he was sleeping, the woman took his phone and used his bank apps and exchanges to transfer funds to her personal accounts. Authorities mentioned that after stealing the money, the South Korean woman fled the location, boarding a plane to another part of the country. She had the intention of staying there and enjoying the stolen funds. However, things did not go the way she had thought as the police nabbed her at a hotel near Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province. She was subsequently arrested and moved back to Jeju City to answer for her crimes. According to the details of the case, the woman admitted to the charges, noting that she carried out the criminal act on January 5 while her boyfriend was sleeping. She also mentioned that she had returned most of the funds, noting that she only owes around 21.9 million won, worth about $15,000. The woman also asked the court for leniency because she had returned part of the funds and is remorseful about her actions. Uptick in crypto-related crimes causes concerns The media in South Korea mentioned that the court refused her plea of leniency because she is a repeat offender, given her history of fraud, and the amount of money owed was still substantial. The case was handled by the court in Jeju province, South Korea. The woman’s legal representatives also urged the courts for mercy, citing their client’s remorse and her actions towards refunding the stolen funds. They argued that the woman owes a smaller amount of money compared to what she originally stole on January 5. The court, during the announcement of the verdict, mentioned that the woman was a repeat offender. The court said she had two previous convictions for fraud, with one of them heading to trial before she stole her boyfriend’s digital assets. The judge refused to consider her plea or give her a second chance because she had repeatedly been given second chances, which she has continually wasted. The judge handed her a two-year jail term. The conviction adds to an increasing number of crypto-related crimes in Jeju and globally, as peer-to-peer trades are now leading to theft, assault, and even murder. In January, a man in his 30s was found stabbed to death in a hotel in Jeju after travelling there to attend a private crypto meeting. In another case, four Chinese nationals were apprehended for stealing $63,000 in digital assets. The same month, 22-year-old Maissa Jebali was arrested for stealing TRUMP meme coins from her ex-boyfriend. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The 8th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been steadily regaining lost ground in the last couple of weeks, following a major downturn in proceedings in the cryptocurrency markets in general and DOGE in particular. DOGE is the world’s first meme coin and one of the oldest digital currencies, dating back to 2014. It started as a joke as the founder, Billy Markus, copied Bitcoin’s code to start a network but changed the font to Comic Sans, which is used in the popular Shiba dog meme. But, with time, the meme coin sector started to attract major attention in the crypto community, peaking during the 2020-2021 bull market when the digital currency rose a spectacular 600000% in just a few months, leaving crypto traders in awe. DOGE’s incredible success powered a massive foray into the meme coin economy that still sees dozens of new tokens released daily. However, DOGE’s major exploits during the 2020-2021 bull market haven’t been replicated in the 2024-2025 edition. The cryptocurrency has yet to come close to the $0.7 All-Time High price point, and if it fails to do so, a major rally will remain elusive. On-chain Activity Surge Nevertheless, a recent surge in the cryptocurrency network’s on-chain activity may spark the bullish forces. According to popular X influencer Ali Martinez, over 280,000 active addresses have been witnessed in the last couple of days, showing strong improvement in on-chain activity. The flurry of blockchain network undertakings is now reaching new six-month highs. Here is the graph shared by Martinez: Image Source: X Price Trend Here is the graph of DOGE from the last couple of months or so: The coin is trading around $0.224, up from $0.17 just a week ago. According to top analysts, a major boost is needed in the ensuing months if the $1 price target is to be realized in the coming months. Analysts are confident that the $1 goal is achievable, and the meme coin economy’s continued short-term exploits mean that the joke token sector is here to stay.

2025-05-18T12:19:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Eyes $120K as BTC Bull Token Presale Heats Up","Bitcoin is back in beast mode. After months of chop and doubt, $BTC has flipped the narrative with a powerful V-shaped recovery that has it trading above $103K. Market sentiment has turned sharply bullish, and it’s not just crypto-native voices shouting ‘to the moon.’ Big money is flowing in. Analysts are calling for a $120K breakout. Meanwhile, U.S. credit risks and macro concerns are adding even more fuel to the Bitcoin fire. This kind of environment is exactly what seasoned crypto investors wait for. And while everyone’s eyes are locked on $BTC, a lesser-known altcoin is quietly gaining steam – one that’s designed to mirror Bitcoin’s momentum and possibly deliver explosive returns as the rally picks up speed. Meet BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the bull market’s sleeper hit in the making. Moody’s, ETFs, and a Wall of Money The bullish Bitcoin momentum isn’t just about technicals – it’s about trust. This week, Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative.’ That might sound like financial jargon, but here’s what it really means: growing fears over U.S. debt and political instability are making investors nervous. And when people lose trust in traditional markets, Bitcoin shines. We’re seeing that play out in real time. Over $5B has poured into Bitcoin ETFs in just days, with investors betting big on $BTC’s next leg up. These aren’t just degen bets – this is serious institutional capital returning to crypto. It’s the kind of inflow that signals the beginning of a real bull market. At the same time, Bitcoin has surged past $103K thanks to a clean V-shaped rebound. Analysts are eyeing $120K as the next major resistance level. Confidence is rising, retail is waking up, and crypto conversations on X are heating up. The market’s moving – and projects built for bullish cycles are about to thrive. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin’s Meme-Fueled Amplifier BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t your average meme coin. It’s a turbocharged, meme-powered project with one mission: ride Bitcoin’s charge to $1M and reward early believers along the way. While most meme coins chase hype with zero utility, $BTCBULL goes further – it pays out actual Bitcoin to its holders. That’s right. It’s the first Bitcoin-themed meme coin that directly rewards its community with real $BTC. Every time Bitcoin hits a milestone – like $150K, or $200K – $BTCBULL holders who bought through Best Wallet and still hold their tokens there receive automatic $BTC airdrops. It’s not just vibes. It’s value, delivered. Just don’t forget to buy and hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . No Best Wallet – no airdrops. On top of that, other Bitcoin milestones like $125K, $175K, and $225K trigger token burns, permanently shrinking the supply of $BTCBULL and boosting scarcity. This isn’t just clever – it’s engineered for momentum. With a tight link to $BTC price action and meme energy baked in, $BTCBULL turns the typical passive HODL into an active ride full of upside. And forget dealing with clunky BRC-20s or cold storage keys. Thanks to a partnership with Best Wallet, you can buy $BTCBULL on Ethereum and receive $BTC rewards directly through your wallet. It’s frictionless, fast, and built for the bull cycle. Why It Works in This Market BTC Bull Token is gaining serious traction – nearly $6M raised in its presale already, with tokens still priced at just $0.00252. And while that might look tiny, the upside is anything but. Analysts forecast a 2025 high of $0.06467. If that hits, that’s a 2,465% gain from today’s price. Let’s put that into perspective. If you bought $1K worth of $BTCBULL today, you’d get around 396K tokens. Now imagine staking those tokens at a modest APY of 15% for a year. That adds 59K more tokens, giving you a total of 455K. At the current price, that’s worth just over $1,150. At the 2025 forecast high of $0.06467, that same bag could be worth over $29,5K. That’s how you turn a meme coin into a moonshot. The timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin is pushing $103K. ETF inflows are exploding. Retail is coming back. And tokens like $BTCBULL – tailor-made to ride this exact wave – could be the biggest winners. The Sleeper Pick Built for the Bull Run Bitcoin is stealing the spotlight, but BTC Bull Token is quietly setting the stage for something bigger. It’s early, it’s explosive, and it’s engineered to thrive in this exact market. If you’re looking for a high-upside play that rewards you in real $BTC as Bitcoin climbs, this might be your moment to get in before the crowd.

The initial entry price was $103,129. However, live data from CoinGlass shows that the mysterious whale capitalized on a brief opportunity they had when bitcoin’s price slipped below $103,000 to double down on their position, which is now worth over $393 million (3,790 BTC). The entry price has been lowered to $103,083, but the liquidation still stands at just shy of $95,600. Given BTC’s current price tag of almost $104,000, the whale stands on a “modest” unrealized profit of $3.3 million as of now. There have been quite a few cases in the past couple of months in which mysterious whales opened large positions on Hyperliquid that caught the community’s attention. Recall another example from March this year when someone opened a massive multi-million-dollar short position. Later, popular crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed that this was William Parker, a UK individual linked to a $1 million casino theft among other scandals. According to the reports, Parker profited around $20 million by using extremely high leverage to open positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which allowed him to manipulate the market.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7585 Market Cap $26.79 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $774.59M Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7683 24-hour Low $0.7295 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.18% 50-day SMA $ 0.688835 14-Day RSI 50.67 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the token is currently trading near $0.757, and shows a modest upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.84, meaning that the coin is in a neutral momentum with potential room for further gains before reaching overbought territory. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, and the price is trending above the middle band, which often indicates bullish continuation. The upper band resistance around $0.854 may act as a short-term ceiling. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could target the $0.90 zone. Support lies near $0.741. Momentum appears cautiously bullish pending a decisive breakout or rejection. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the price is currently trading at approximately $0.759, nestled between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands. This suggests a neutral-to-bullish posture but lacks strong directional momentum. The MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line and signal line dipping below the zero axis, hinting at potential short-term weakness. The Balance of Power (BoP) reads negative, pointing to a slight bearish pressure in recent sessions. If the price breaks below $0.737, a correction toward $0.70 may follow. However, maintaining above $0.764 could preserve the bullish structure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation.

On the daily chart, ADA is trading near $0.757, slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating an effort to recover upward momentum. The RSI hovers around 59, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment without overbought pressure. However, price action shows resistance near $0.80. On the 4-hour chart, ADA has slipped slightly, with MACD showing a weakening bullish signal and the Balance of Power turning negative. This reflects fading bullish strength in the short term. A sustained hold above $0.737 may preserve upside potential, while a drop below risks a correction. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030. At the start of May, ADA price skyrocketed to $0.8.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/,"",""
2025-05-18T11:45:44.000Z,"‘Epidemic of Scams’ Flooding Instagram and Facebook Affecting Many Different Industries, Says Meta: Report","Meta executives are reportedly acknowledging a serious new problem with scams affecting its social media platforms. A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of social media behemoths Instagram and Facebook, tells the Wall Street Journal that the corporate giant is dealing with “an epidemic of scams” that has been growing exponentially in recent years, both in scale and sophistication. “As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts.” The spokesperson reveals that Meta is experimenting with facial-recognition technology while also forming partnerships with banks and tech firms since the scams are affecting so many industries and “different parts of society.” Citing people familiar with the matter, WSJ also reports that JPMorgan Chase has raised concerns with Meta about its policing – or lack thereof – of scams. Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase customers between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a WSJ source. JPMorgan also recently began blocking certain Zelle payments and warning users about transactions originating from social media platforms like Meta. The person said that the number of scams linked to Meta has shown improvement in recent months. However, documents seen by WSJ reportedly show that Meta has recently deprioritized enforcing scams, avoiding takedowns of erroneous advertisements because of supposed safety concerns, while also cutting costs and moving resources to other departments. WSJ interviewed Edgar Guzman, the owner of a home improvement supplies and garden equipment company in Atlanta, who said scams are relentlessly targeting his customers, prompting them to make payments for products that never arrive. Says Guzman, “What sucks is we have to break it to people that they’ve been scammed – we don’t even do online sales… We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Last time this happened in 2021, a bevy of popular altcoins returned cryptocurrency buyers 28,000% by the end of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Takes 4% Spill Bitcoin’s market share fell from 65% to 61% between May 7 and May 13, according to TradingView. Markets haven’t seen that 65% level of BTC dominance over altcoins since 2021. That year was the altseason, as crypto veterans like to call it, that launched Dogecoin’s price tens of thousands of percent upward in under 12 months. Meanwhile, in 2021, a $100 Shiba Inu investment went from Jan. 1, 2021, to over $14 million by Mar. 2023.

There are only 21 million #Bitcoin . Do the math. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 8, 2025 As Bitcoin boosters like to say: Do the math. While a 4% dip in Bitcoin dominance may seem like a small fraction, the numerator here is a global Internet currency with a two trillion dollar market cap on May 7.

Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price and market cap grew by 7% during those six days, even as its wedge on the pie chart shrank.

It’s academic, secure, and designed for the future. But what if you could stop waiting for the future—and start building real wealth today? That’s exactly what average investors are doing with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While Cardano holders rely on slow staking and price movement, BTC-S users are already seeing explosive gains from a blockchain designed not for institutions, but for everyday people with a smartphone and a dream. And the numbers? They’re not just better—they’re life-changing. Cardano: Brilliant Design, Slower Rewards Cardano’s layered architecture and peer-reviewed foundation have earned it respect across the crypto space. But when it comes to helping users generate real wealth fast, it’s often too slow. Staking returns are modest, and like many Proof-of-Stake networks, they require time, patience, and locked funds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris has skipped the academic papers and delivered something more powerful—daily income and real-world utility. Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Make People Rich This isn’t a clone of Bitcoin. This is a reimagining of what it should’ve been for the masses. A dual-consensus model gives BTC-S an edge: PoW (Proof-of-Work) for foundational security DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) for speed and scale 10,000 transactions per second, 2-second finality, and 99.95% less energy usage than Bitcoin mining. It doesn’t just protect wealth. It builds it fast. BTC-S is a blockchain that generates value every day, directly into your hands, using only your phone. The project is also audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and fully KYC-verified , giving new investors confidence that this isn’t just hype. It’s substance. From Zero to Wealth: How BTC-S Is Changing Lives We’re not talking theory. We’re talking early BTC-S investors already reporting 300–400% gains thanks to presale access and daily mobile mining rewards. The upcoming Solaris Nova App will allow users to mine BTC-S from any smartphone, with one tap. There are no setups, no rigs, and no confusing software. Just a smart algorithm that runs quietly in your pocket—earning real money every day. And thanks to the double rewards referral program, the growth doesn’t stop there. Users who refer friends receive 5% commission in BTC-S every time someone buys through their link. Even better? The person they invite gets 5% extra tokens on their purchase. It’s a win-win model built to multiply community wealth—fast. To access it, all you need is an account on BitcoinSolaris.com, your personal referral code, and the motivation to share it with your network. From social media to direct invites, the earning potential grows every time you connect someone new. What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early? Bitcoin Solaris vs Cardano: Why BTC-S Wins for Wealth Builders Feature Cardano Bitcoin Solaris Daily Earnings Slow staking rewards Mobile mining pays daily Hardware Needed None None Energy Efficiency High 99.95% less than Bitcoin Earning Boost System None 5% referral commission + 5% bonus Average Investor Wealth Rate Gradual 3x–4x faster returns (reported) Presale Firepower The BTC-S presale is where the real money’s already flowing: Current Price: $3 Next Phase: $4 Launch Price: $20 Over 8,900 users have joined so far, and the project has raised more than $750,000, making it one of the fastest-growing token sales in 2025. The presale runs for just 90 days and ends July 31, 2025. With a projected 1,900% return, early buyers are locking in gains most Cardano holders haven’t seen in years. Community members also get beta access to the Solaris Nova App, offering them a front-row seat to the mining revolution before the full app goes live. Limited-Time Bonus: Earn Up to 75% More BTC-S in Phase 3 For a short time during Phase 3, Bitcoin Solaris investors can unlock exclusive bonus tokens by contributing set amounts: Invest $1,000 → Get 25% Bonus ($1,250 in BTC-S) Invest $2,500 → Get 50% Bonus ($3,750 in BTC-S) Invest $4,000 → Get 75% Bonus ($7,000 in BTC-S) This offer is only valid during Phase 3 and for new purchases. Once this phase ends or bonus tokens run out—whichever comes first—the event will close. The Crypto Community Is Paying Attention Influencers across the space are already catching on. A recent deep dive from Crypto Legends explains why Bitcoin Solaris is grabbing headlines: its mobile mining model, explosive growth, and tokenomics that reward the little guy, not just whales. Stay connected with the team and receive real-time updates on Telegram and X . Conclusion: Stop Hoping. Start Earning. The people building wealth aren’t crypto elites.

2025-05-18T11:17:29.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for May 19: Bulls Eye $104K but Momentum Still Mixed","The Bitcoin price today is trading around $103,650, attempting to stabilize just below the key $104,000 resistance zone after a brief consolidation phase. While the macro trend remains bullish, the recent Bitcoin price action shows tightening within a symmetrical triangle formation on lower time frames, suggesting that a breakout—or breakdown—may be imminent heading into May 19. What’s Happening with Bitcoin’s Price? Looking at the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to respect a rising support trendline that connects the early May lows to the current structure. After surging from sub-$100,000 levels earlier this month, the Bitcoin price has faced repeated rejections just under $105,000. The consolidation near $103,300–$103,800 represents a period of indecision following the bullish rally, but structure remains intact as long as bulls defend $101,500.

2025-05-18T11:01:32.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Technical Breakout at $2,520 Targets $2,745 Resistance—What Is Next for ETH in June?","Ethereum (ETH/USD) is back in the spotlight as it tests a key resistance zone inside a symmetrical triangle. At the moment, ETH is trading around $2,508, below both the triangle’s upper trendline and the 50-period EMA ($2,519) on the 2-hour chart. Some expected an early breakout, but price is still coiled, no confirmed break above resistance. This triangle formation, created by converging trendlines, means consolidation and decreasing volatility—a classic sign of a big move coming. ETH has held a series of higher lows, keeping the bullish case alive, but buyers haven’t produced a strong breakout candle yet. Volume is low and recent candles are showing hesitation with mixed body sizes and small wicks. Ethereum Momentum Building as MACD Turns Bullish Momentum indicators are hinting at a change in sentiment. MACD is showing a fresh bullish crossover and the histogram is green—often a sign of upward momentum. Ethereum Price Setup ETH is coiling inside a symmetrical triangle, trading near $2,509 and pressing against key resistance. Watch for a breakout above $2,527 to confirm momentum. No breakout yet—just pressure building. #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto #Trading #ETHUSD #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/kNYkrIUM9R — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 This, combined with higher lows in price, means buyers are gaining strength, but confirmation is missing. If ETH can break above $2,527—triangle’s upper boundary and horizontal resistance—it will trigger bullish targets at $2,649 and $2,720. Below $2,500 or a break below $2,420 will invalidate the setup and test lower support. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction remains neutral as ETH hasn’t broken out yet, but the setup is getting close to resolution. Watch for breakout volume or rejection. Patience is key in triangle setups—entering too early can be choppy. Trade Setup: Entry (bullish): Above $2,527 on strong bullish close Targets: $2,649 and $2,720 Stop-loss: Below $2,420 (triangle support) Summary: Think of this triangle like a pressure cooker—it’s building steam, but unless the lid pops off (above $2,527), price will stay contained. Wait for breakout confirmation before entering. Ethereum is consolidating at resistance, a big move is coming. Whether bulls can take advantage remains to be seen—but all eyes are on $2,527. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

2025-05-18T10:59:01.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Inches Towards $105,000 As Overall Sentiment Remains Bullish","Bitcoin (BTC) price action has remained subdued over the weekend as the flagship cryptocurrency trades within a narrow price band extending from $100,000 to $105,000. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,722 on Saturday but rebounded to briefly cross $104,000 before moving to its current level. The cryptocurrency has registered a marginal increase during the ongoing session, trading around $103,950. Bitcoin May Skyrocket As US Loses Top Tier Credit Rating The US has lost its AAA credit rating over rising national debt and deficits. Moody’s Rating downgraded the US credit rating, downgrading it from its perfect AAA status to AA1 due to increasing debt and interest significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. The downgrade is being viewed as a warning to investors and could increase borrowing costs for Americans already grappling with inflation and tariffs. Moody’s had held a perfect credit score for the US since 1917. Moody’s explained the downgrade in its official statement, adding, “The downgrade reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” However, despite the downgrade, Moody’s assigned a stable outlook for the country, highlighting the Federal Reserve’s historically strong and independent monetary policy. However, this outlook could be at risk, with President Trump threatening to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, an adverse market reaction forced Trump to backtrack. Journalist Michelle Makori believes that Bitcoin and gold are worth watching following the downgrade, adding she expected their prices to skyrocket. According to Makori, the downgrade creates the perfect environment for Bitcoin and gold prices to surge. “Watch Bitcoin and gold. America now shares a credit rating with Austria and Finland. Hard assets don’t lie. Watch Gold and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Whales Accumulating Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are continuing to accumulate the asset, according to OKC Partner and Binance KOL Ted Pillows. According to analysts, Bitcoin Whales acquired 2,180 BTC valued at around $226,750,000 on May 15, indicating strong market confidence. Large accumulations by Bitcoin whales generally suggest bullish sentiment among investors and a strong potential for further price appreciation. BTC is trading around the $103,900 mark at the time of writing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $100,000 despite selling pressure and buyer exhaustion. Market watchers are watching for signs of an uptrend and whether it will carry BTC past its all-time high of $109,000. Despite waning momentum, market experts believe BTC’s uptrend is far from over. Blockstream CEO Adam Beck stated earlier in the week that Bitcoin’s price was strangely low and could surge to $500,000 or even $1M over the next four years. Meanwhile, another analyst predicted that BTC’s next market top could be $120,000, but only if the $90,000 support holds. However, some bearish signals are emerging despite overall bullish sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp increase of 2.19% on Tuesday, settling at $96,845. A marginal increase the following day saw the price reach $97,000. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, crossing $100,000 and settling at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. However, it recovered on Saturday, rising nearly 2% to $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, falling almost 1% and settling at $103,802. Source: TradingView BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped 1.04% to $102,728, but not before falling to an intraday low of $100,694. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified.

2025-05-18T10:55:02.000Z,"Best Meme Coin to Buy Now? Apple’s Market Signal Pushes Crypto Momentum","If you're trying to find the best meme coin to buy as 2025 unfolds, you're not alone. Apple just made waves in the traditional market by announcing a $0.26 per-share dividend on May 15, 2025, and while that may seem unrelated to crypto, it’s actually a signal worth watching. When a $2.9 trillion company boosts market sentiment, it can ripple through institutional strategies—including crypto investments. Stocks climbed, and within hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum surged in tandem. In the world of meme coins, that type of risk-on momentum can be a green light. In this piece, we’ll break down how traditional market events like Apple’s dividend can push meme coin sentiment forward, and spotlight one project— Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —that could become the best meme coin to buy right now. Market Signals: Why Apple’s Dividend Matters to Crypto Investors On May 15, Apple confirmed a $0.26 per-share dividend, and while the payout is standard, the implications are bigger. Apple’s stock rose by 1.2%, Nasdaq jumped 0.8%, and suddenly risk appetite was back on the table. At the same time: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.1%, hitting $63,600. Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.8%, reaching $2,980. BTC trading volume spiked by 15% to $28B in 24 hours. ETH trading volume hit $12.5B—a 10% increase. Why does this matter? It shows a strong correlation between tech stock stability and crypto confidence. For investors, especially those seeking short-term trades or tokens with high upside, this kind of momentum can push smaller assets, including meme coins, into breakout territory. Key Signals in the Best Meme Coins When the market is quiet, identifying the best meme coin requires spotting early signs of movement. Here's what to look for: Unique Narrative or Utility Does the coin just ride on memes, or is there more to the story? The most promising meme coins in 2025 combine humor with utility—like access to DeFi tools or integration with real AI. A strong narrative not only grabs attention, but also helps the coin sustain interest during market dips. Coins with no clear message often fade fast. Strong Community Engagement A meme coin lives and dies by its community. Watch for active Telegrams, Twitter spaces, and organic content—it’s often the first signal of a brewing breakout. Real engagement includes user-made memes, community voting, and consistent dialogue—not just hype from the devs. The louder and more authentic the buzz, the more likely it is to translate into upward price pressure. Tokenomics That Drive Scarcity The best meme coins usually implement a capped supply, staking rewards, or burn mechanisms that help increase value over time. Scarcity works when it's paired with demand—especially during presales or exchange listings. Catalysts and Momentum Look for upcoming exchange listings, influencer interest, or new partnerships. These events often drive price jumps when interest is already brewing. Coins that consistently push updates and remain visible have a much better chance of staying relevant. When these pieces come together, meme coins can flip from quiet to explosive in hours. That’s why timing matters—and why smart investors track more than just price. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): A Meme Coin With Breakout Potential In a crowded space of coins trying to go viral, Dawgz AI is aiming higher. Built on the Ethereum network, it combines meme culture with AI-powered trading utility—a hybrid that some investors believe could position it among the top meme coins of the year. Here’s why DAGZ is showing early signs of strength: AI + Meme Culture Instead of riding trends, Dawgz AI creates its own. It integrates Blackbox AI algorithms designed to provide automated trading strategies—giving holders more than just a token to speculate on. Early Presale Success With over $3.4M raised, the project has already built a strong base of supporters. That’s a key advantage for community-driven growth. Audited for Security The smart contract was audited by SolidProof , a recognized firm, adding trust for early backers. Tokenomics With Staking Built-In 8.888B total supply 20% allocated for staking Rewards available even during presale This model rewards long-term holders and reduces sell pressure—a smart move for maintaining value. Ethereum Foundation Being an ERC-20 token means it’s easy to store, trade, and integrate across existing DeFi apps. Active Visibility Push The team is executing targeted marketing to ensure the project stays top of mind—a key move when attention spans are short. Dawgz AI could be one of those rare projects that makes its move before the rest of the meme market catches up. The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? The Apple dividend signal might seem distant from meme coin trading—but when institutional money shifts, it creates waves across all assets. Bitcoin moved. Ethereum followed. Meme coins are next in line. For those looking for the best meme coin to buy now, Dawgz AI offers a compelling mix of narrative, community, utility, and timing. While nothing is guaranteed, early signals point to DAGZ as one of the few new meme coins preparing to lead, not follow. FAQs Section Which meme coin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI is gaining traction for its mix of AI utility and meme appeal, making it one to watch closely. Which meme coin will reach $1 in 2025? It's hard to predict, but Dawgz AI's strong tokenomics and roadmap could position it for big moves if demand continues. Which meme coin will 100x? New tokens with utility and momentum, like Dawgz AI, may offer that kind of upside—though risk is always part of the equation. Which memecoin has the most potential? Dawgz AI stands out right now for combining AI trading tools with a viral-friendly community narrative. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-18T10:49:49.000Z,"Why HashFly Stands Out Among Leading Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025","Since its establishment in 2013, HashFly has consistently led the cloud mining industry by offering secure, transparent, and highly profitable Bitcoin mining services. As the cloud mining market grows and diversifies, users are faced with many choices — from Hashing24 and NiceHash to StormGain and BitFuFu. But how does HashFly truly compare, and why should it be your platform of choice? 1. Proven Track Record and Longevity HashFly ’s foundation in 2013 places it among the pioneers of cloud mining. Unlike newer platforms still building their reputation, HashFly has a decade of experience supporting over a million satisfied miners worldwide. This longevity reflects its stability, reliability, and commitment to delivering consistent results. 2. Superior Return on Investment (ROI) While many platforms offer cloud mining contracts, few can match HashFly’s high daily returns—up to 7.2%—and clear, short-term contract structures. For example, smaller contracts starting at $200 provide quick, daily profits, enabling users to reinvest or withdraw with confidence. Other platforms often feature longer contract durations with less attractive yields, making HashFly an ideal choice for investors seeking fast, tangible returns. 3. User-Friendly Experience and Instant Bonuses HashFly simplifies cloud mining with an intuitive platform and mobile app, making it accessible to both beginners and seasoned investors. Upon registration, users receive a $10 instant bonus, giving them a risk-free start to mining. By contrast, platforms like NiceHash operate as hash power marketplaces, which can be more complex for new users, while others like Hashing24 require higher minimum investments and offer fewer immediate incentives. 4. Transparent and Daily Payout System Transparency is critical in crypto mining. HashFly delivers daily payouts directly to user accounts—no delays, no hidden fees. In comparison, some platforms may have weekly or monthly payout schedules or complex fee structures, potentially limiting user cash flow. HashFly’s daily payout system empowers users with liquidity and control. 5. Responsive Customer Support Mining investments demand trust. HashFly’s 24/7 customer support ensures users receive prompt assistance whenever needed.

2025-05-18T10:45:07.000Z,"Will the Next Move in Bitcoin Prices Lead to a Record or Is a Correction on the Way? Analyst Outlines Two Price Scenarios","Ali Martinez, one of the well-known analysts of the cryptocurrency market, predicted the next move for Bitcoin (BTC) in his latest assessment. With the BTC price at a critical price threshold, Martinez first questioned whether a new all-time high or a correction would come first. According to the analyst, the BTC price has hit a key resistance area at $107,000 following a 42% rally last month. Martinez added that this level is historically a turning point. However, the analyst argued that the current momentum has become overstretched, with the RSI data on the daily chart showing BTC in overbought territory, which is a common occurrence in short-term pullbacks. Warning about the pullback, the analyst also said that BTC whales sold around 30,000 coins, which means profit taking from current levels has occurred. Related News: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Predicts BTC's Movement in the Coming Days Based on Previous Data! According to the analyst, the area between $95,850 and $98,730 will be a must-hold support area for BTC if selling pressure increases. Martinez noted that a breakout from these levels could result in a deeper correction for BTC. On the bullish side, the analyst claimed that if the Bitcoin price manages to stay above the mentioned level, it could enter a period of consolidation and gather strength for a breakout towards $116,900 as the next major target. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-18T10:40:30.000Z,"Bitcoin Solaris Turns Retail Investors Into Crypto Elites: Hedera Holders Left Behind","Hedera Hashgraph has positioned itself as an enterprise-focused distributed ledger, with governing council members from Fortune 500 companies and consensus nodes limited to approved entities. While its technology is optimized for speed and low fees, everyday users have few ways to participate meaningfully in network operations or generate yield from holding HBAR. The reward structure favors corporate stakeholders, leaving retail users without direct incentives or control. Bitcoin Solaris disrupts that model with a network designed around everyday participation. Through its Nova App, any smartphone becomes a mining node — allowing users to earn BTC-S tokens daily, with no specialized hardware, no validator applications, and no capital lock-ups. The system transforms casual users into protocol contributors and opens a direct pathway to get rich through real-time, on-chain income rather than speculative price movement. Mobile Mining: Income Without Barriers Bitcoin Solaris’s core innovation is its mobile mining model. Users download the Nova App, allocate a small portion of phone storage (1–5 GB) and background CPU, and begin earning passively. The app runs in the background, consuming minimal energy and integrating seamlessly into normal device usage. Unlike Hedera, which restricts consensus and rewards to a fixed set of enterprise validators, Bitcoin Solaris invites anyone with a smartphone to contribute and earn. Mining rewards are distributed based on device uptime and network support, meaning even those without deep technical knowledge or institutional backing can gain exposure to daily blockchain income — turning phones into financial tools for wealth accumulation. Built for Scale, Speed, and Accessibility Bitcoin Solaris operates on a dual-layer blockchain optimized for performance and decentralization: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the ledger and handle consensus without high energy costs. The Solaris Layer, built on Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT), processes transactions and mining operations at over 10,000 TPS, with 2-second finality. This structure separates transaction throughput from validator consensus, allowing the network to scale independently of centralized control. Hedera may offer high speed, but participation is reserved for enterprise gatekeepers. Bitcoin Solaris ensures speed with inclusivity — enabling protocol-level rewards for global users regardless of geography or financial status. In a recent review, Crypto Legends broke down how Bitcoin Solaris gives power to users through mining, while Hedera remains tightly controlled by council members. The video highlights accessibility, income models, and how mobile mining opens doors for everyday investors. BTC-S at 3 USDT: Smart Entry Before Demand Surges Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S tokens at 3 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated for presale participants. There is no inflation, no staking requirement, and no dilution from future minting. By securing tokens during presale, users position themselves for early access to Nova App mining, low initial difficulty rates, and first participation in validator and app-layer deployments. For those seeking to get rich through contribution rather than speculation, this stage presents a uniquely timed opportunity before public rollout and exchange listings. Get Up to 75% Extra BTC-S in Phase 3 Invest specific amounts to activate bonus rewards during this phase: Invest exactly $1,000 → Receive a 25% bonus Invest exactly $2,500 → Receive a 50% bonus Invest exactly $4,000 → Receive a 75% bonus Bonuses are valid only during Phase 3. Investing less than the required amount will not qualify. Offer ends when the phase closes. Audited for Security, Designed for the Masses Bitcoin Solaris has passed multiple independent audits confirming the reliability, fairness, and scalability of its infrastructure: Cyberscope Audit : Assessed smart contracts, mobile mining structure, and token emission Freshcoins Audit : Reviewed consensus logic and cross-layer interaction integrity KYC Verification : Verified development team identity and governance oversight These verifications ensure that participation is secure, transparent, and immune to the opaque control models used by legacy projects. Hedera may serve institutions — but Bitcoin Solaris serves everyone. Through daily mobile mining, decentralized reward distribution, and presale access at just 3 USDT, it empowers users to get rich by participating in the network itself. As more retail investors leave passive ecosystems behind, Bitcoin Solaris is becoming the foundation for a new kind of crypto elite — one built from the ground up, phone by phone.

According to reports, authorities seized assets worth $4.5 million, including a beachfront mansion, luxury cars, and Bitcoin, from the convicted individual. According to reports, the individual, 32-year-old Shane Duffy, from Queensland, saw millions worth of those assets seized after a lengthy investigation into his illegal activities. He was apprehended on charges of stealing digital assets and cyber hacking. The authorities seized Duffy’s beachfront home back in April. In addition, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) of the AFP also seized a 2019 black Mercedes-Benz sedan and about 25 Bitcoins. AFP seizes assets worth $4.5 million from hacker According to reports, Duffy was suspected of carrying out the theft of about 950 bitcoins from a French crypto exchange in 2013. The assets are now worth about $150 million. Before then, he had been convicted of hacking Riot Games, the US company behind the popular video game League of Legends. In 2018, the CACT initiated an investigation after AUSTRAC was alerted to the development by authorities in Luxembourg about his suspicious bitcoin transactions. However, the authorities have yet to bring up criminal charges in connection with the alleged theft. Meanwhile, they have been able to halt the suspected proceeds of the alleged crime under federal laws, even without a prosecution. Authorities were able to secure the restraining order for the assets obtained in 2019, and they were subsequently forfeited in April. According to the AFP, the assets include a waterfront mansion in Beachmere, Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, which was purchased at about $1.1 million, and is now estimated to be worth about $2 million. The authorities added that the property was held in the suspect’s mother’s name. CACT has seized criminal assets worth $1.2 billion After the sale of the seized properties, the proceeds are expected to be transferred into a special fund that assists crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives. The AFP says it is still committed to confiscating alleged proceeds to disrupt the activities of criminals and cybercrime. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy highlighted the law backing the seizure. “The Proceeds of Crime Act provides law enforcement agencies with unique powers to restrain and forfeit instruments and proceeds of crime,” he said. He added that criminals are driven by greed, and unfortunately it is law-abiding Australians and businesses who end up losing their hard-earned money to these cybercriminals. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. According to reports, the CACT has seized criminal assets worth over $1.2 billion since 2019. These assets include houses, cars, fine art, luxury items, and digital assets. According to court documents obtained by the media, Duffy allegedly accumulated more than $32,000 in 2013 through the sale of access to inactive League of Legends accounts. The suspect was said to have hacked the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to promote the illegal operation and allegedly partnered with another hacker to disrupt matches on the platform by disconnecting players. Riot Games mentioned the hack resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2016, Duffy was sentenced to two-and-half years in prison, a term he served after pleading guilty in Brisbane District Court.

After making a strong run toward the $2,700 mark on Tuesday, May 13, the altcoin’s price has struggled to build on its momentum over the past few days. The price of ETH did manage to stay above the $2,500 mark over the past week, bouncing back from the psychological level on Thursday, May 15. However, the recent struggles seem to have compounded over the weekend, with the Ethereum price losing the $2,500 level to end the week. The Next Support Cushion For ETH Price Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an interesting on-chain outlook on the price of Ethereum and its latest lack of bullish momentum. Following the dip of ETH beneath the $2,500 mark, the online pundit has identified the altcoin’s next significant support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Market Signals Further Upside Potential For BTC Price: New ATH Soon? This evaluation revolves around the average cost basis of several Ethereum investors. Cost-basis analysis basically measures the ability of a price level to act as support or resistance — based on the total amount of coins last purchased by investors at this level. As shown in the chart above, the size of the circles directly corresponds with the quantity of ETH tokens bought within each price zone and the region’s significance as support or resistance. In essence, the bigger the dot, the higher the number of tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots represent resistance (as they are above the asset price). Data provided by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that the Ethereum price has key support around the $2,354 – $2,430 zone, where 2.64 million addresses purchased 63.9 million tokens (worth $153.04 billion at an average price of $2,395). As Martinez highlighted, this price bracket would serve as an on-chain cushion for the ETH price, as investors with their cost bases around the level would likely defend their positions by buying more tokens if the price falls toward $2,400. The fresh buying pressure around this price region would help counter the downward pressure, thereby keeping the Ethereum price afloat. The highlighted chart shows that it is all clear blue skies for the price of Ethereum, with no significant resistance lying ahead. However, the altcoin will need to hold above the $2,400 level, or it risks falling to as low as $2,200. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,480, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily. According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin ( BTC )’s role as a monetary protocol. “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote , arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data. Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools. Source: Adam Back Related: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overview Ammous compares Bitcoin spam to email Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system. “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions. “So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added. The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy. Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems. Source: Saifedean Ammous The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder. In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages. Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

After hitting $74,652 earlier this year, BTC has made a V-shaped recovery and is now above $104,000 and heading towards $109,427. This technical pattern – sharp declines followed by sharp rebounds – is a sign of strong market conviction and often precedes big rallies. Since breaking above the 50-day EMA ($94,870), Bitcoin has been in a steep trend with higher lows and accumulation.

On the 1-hour chart, BTC is coiling in a symmetrical triangle – an indecision zone that often precedes big breakouts. At $104,007, the price is pressing against the triangle’s upper resistance and horizontal barrier at $104,550. Technically, Bitcoin is looking good beneath the surface. The MACD has turned green, the 50-period EMA ($103,421) is holding as support and recent candles are showing increasing buying pressure and higher lows. If bulls can confirm a breakout with a strong 1-hour candle above $104,550, BTC could quickly go to $105,668 and possibly $106,685. But if it doesn’t break out cleanly, it could go back to $103,000 or $102,700 before the next attempt. Bitcoin Price Chart (symmetrical triangle pattern) – Source: Tradingview $120K in Sight for Bitcoin? Macro Momentum Building With Bitcoin’s V-shaped recovery and technical pressure building, eyes are now on $120,000 – a psychological and Fibonacci extension target if BTC clears $109K cleanly.

The broader setup is also bullish: Whale accumulation is increasing, according to on-chain data ETF inflows are strong Institutional sentiment is shifting from cautious to opportunistic Conclusion Bitcoin is looking good on both daily and 1-hour charts.

The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties.

Many altcoins have marked more substantial gains in the past day, but most of them are reps of the ever-volatile meme coin niche. BTC Consolidation Phase Endures Bitcoin began the business week with some enhanced volatility following the trade deal struck between the US and China. At first, the cryptocurrency shot up to a multi-month peak of almost $106,000 before the bears took brief control of the market and drove it south to under $101,000 hours later. Nevertheless, the predominantly bullish sentiment prevailed and bitcoin remained within six-digit price territory. Moreover, it bounced off and spiked to $105,000 a day later where it found another rejection. The price moves repeated in a smaller extent but BTC overall managed to remain above $103,000. It slipped below that lower boundary yesterday, but that was also short-lived and now sits around $104,000. This has pushed its market capitalization to over $2.060 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has retraced slightly since yesterday, but is still above 60%. Yet, this hasn’t stopped many analysts from speculating that the altseason has started. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Memes Rebound Most altcoins have bounced off after yesterday’s nosedive. Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,500 level after a 2% daily increase, while XRP has neared $2.4 following a similar jump. More impressive daily pumps come from SOL, TRX, AVAX, and LINK. However, the meme coins lead in terms of daily gains. The largest of the bunch has soared by 5% to $0.22 while SHIB is up by 5.5% and sits above $0.000015. Even bigger gains come from the likes of WIF (11%), Fartcoin (9%), BONK (8%), and FLOKI (8%). PI has found a place somewhere between them with a 9% daily increase.

After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 225 Ether ( ETH ) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.
