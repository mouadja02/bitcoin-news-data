2025-05-18T16:00:00.000Z,"Shiba Inu loses bark: Memecoin rally cools amid falling burns, bets","The Shiba Inu price rally has stalled as trading volume, futures open interest, and its burn rate continue to decline. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, has dropped to $0.000015, down from this week’s high of $0.00001750. CoinGecko data shows that the daily volume has dropped in the past few weeks, signaling demand is drying up. Shiba Inu had a 24-hour volume of $173 million on Sunday, much lower than Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) $1.416 billion and Pepe’s ( PEPE ) $933 million. Its volume was also lower than that of other smaller meme coins, such as Official Trump, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Peanut the Squirrel. The same trend is happening in the futures market, where open interest has been downtrending after peaking at $272 million on May 11. It has dropped to $216 million, a smaller figure than other meme coins like Bonk and Pepe.

A high open interest is a sign of high volume and liquidity. Shiba Inu price has also dropped as the daily burn rate has slowed in the past few days. Data shows that the daily burn rate dropped by 78% on Sunday to 3.3 million. Less than 70 million SHIB coins were burned since Tuesday last week. Shiba Inu burns are usually bullish because they reduce the amount of coins in circulation and boost market sentiment. Further, the total value locked in the Shibarium network has dropped in the last seven days. It fell from $3.98 million to $3.41 million, with most dApps in the ecosystem, like ShibaSwap and K9 Finance, losing assets. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing Shiba Inu Coin consolidation could be calm before the storm and a surge. The weekly chart shows that the SHIB price has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00001076. A double-bottom often leads to a strong bullish breakout, potentially to the neckline, which, in this case, is at the November high of $0.00003390, up by 133% from the current level. Shiba Inu is also forming the popular harmonic pattern known as XABCD. It has already completed the XA, AB, and BC phases and is now in the early stages of the last CD phase. If this happens, the SHIB price will likely bounce back and hit the 2024 high of $0.00004618, up by 227% from the current level.

2025-05-18T15:50:43.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Coinbase Reveals $400M Cost of Data Hack","Coinbase faces a critical security breach just days before its S&P 500 listing. Hackers reportedly bribed insiders to bypass protocols, accessed sensitive customer data, and exposed vulnerabilities ahead of its market debut. While Coinbase has pledged full reimbursement and is collaborating with the FBI, trust has eroded—its stock COIN fell over 4% following the incident. The incident highlights broader risks for crypto: as adoption grows, bad actors are increasingly targeting internal vulnerabilities. Amid the uncertainty, investors are prioritizing projects emphasizing decentralization, community-driven security, and transparent innovation. For those evaluating where to navigate this environment, the best crypto to buy now may be those addressing systemic security challenges while advancing blockchain’s core principles. Crypto’s Trust Crisis: Coinbase Hit by $400M Hack with Insider Help Coinbase just got sucker-punched by hackers—and it’s messy. The crypto giant dropped a bombshell blog post today: attackers allegedly bribed employees and contractors to swipe customer data, potentially costing the firm a jaw-dropping $400 million. How? By impersonating Coinbase support and tricking users into coughing up their crypto. “Less than 1%” of customer data was stolen, and the criminals demanded $20 million to keep quiet. Coinbase told them to pound sand. Instead of paying up, Coinbase vowed to refund every victim, even as its stock nosedived 4.1% ahead of its S&P 500 debut. Talk about bad timing. “This isn’t just a Coinbase problem—it’s crypto’s dumpster fire,” said Nick Jones, founder of Zumo. He’s right: Chainalysis reports crypto firms lost $2.2 billion to hackers last year alone. To fight back, Coinbase fired the rogue staff, slapped a $20 million bounty on the hackers’ heads, and teamed up with the FBI. “We’re coming for these clowns,” a company rep growled. But here’s the scary part: this isn’t some lone wolf attack. As crypto goes mainstream, hackers are weaponizing insider access like never before. Remember the $600M Poly Network heist? Or the Axie Infinity disaster? Coinbase is now urging users to double-check every email and enable two-factor authentication—because even the “safest” platforms aren’t bulletproof. “We’ll fix this,” they promised, but trust is crumbling faster than a stale cookie. Bottom line? Crypto’s gold rush is a hacker’s playground, and until companies lock down their teams, we’re all just sitting ducks. Best Crypto To Buy Now As Coinbase scrambles to clean up a $400 million mess, it’s clear that trust in crypto is changing. This breach wasn’t about weak passwords; it was insiders flipping for cash. With the “safest” crypto firm burned, the industry must brace for more. But amidst the chaos, certain tokens are rising, built with solid security and utility-first ecosystems. These projects aren’t just hype—they’re hope. The best crypto to buy now as Coinbase’s fall reshapes trust in the market. Bitcoin As Coinbase stumbles, Bitcoin stands tall—battle-hardened, borderless, and immune to insider bribes. In a world where platforms get hacked, BTC reminds us: be your own bank, or risk losing everything. The price of Bitcoin soaring above $100K once again, leading many to speculate that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, may have surpassed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in wealth. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, Satoshi’s crypto wallet is estimated to hold around $113.8 billion in Bitcoin, as reported by Benzinga—while Bill Gates' net worth is estimated at $112.9 billion by Forbes. Undoubtedly, Bitcoin is poised to reach even greater heights, with experts like Arthur Hayes and JP Morgan predicting that its saturation point is still a long way off. In technical terms, it is currently trading at around $104K with a market cap of $2.06 trillion, securing its position in 1st place. It has shown a 0.52% growth in the past 24 hours, suggesting that the saturation point is still far off, creating an opportunity for potential buyers to capitalize on upcoming opportunities. Bitcoin's influence extends beyond finance, often referred to as \""digital gold.\"" It also holds political weight—recently, Eric Trump remarked, \""Everyone in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Mind of Pepe Coinbase got tricked, highlighting the need for simpler and more secure alternatives. With its unique and innovative roots, it’s fair to say that Mind of Pepe mocks the mess. This meme-fueled thinker thrives on irony, weaving chaos into creativity. In a world of hacks and heists, Pepe’s mind games focus on delivering sharp market insights—many of which are likely to emphasize the importance of security. Mind of Pepe combines the comedic themes of memes with the advantages of an AI-driven ecosystem. Developed by Elvora Labs, Mind of Pepe features an AI agent that learns from the crypto ecosystem and provides sharp insights in the form of posts on X, while also engaging with the broader cryptocurrency community. Among the many tools developed by the Mind of Pepe team, the focus is on crypto insights, trading alpha calls, and the ability to create and deploy tokens. These factors have helped it raise close to $10 million to date, with its presale set to end by the end of May. Solana Coinbase crumbles from within—but Solana’s chain races ahead, unbothered. With lightning-fast speeds and a builder army, it’s not just scaling—it’s surviving the trust collapse. While others patch holes, SOL rewrites the infrastructure. It’s not just hype—it’s horsepower. In a study by CoinMarketCap, it was revealed that the top seven performing ecosystem tokens are meme coins or meme coin-related projects. This underscores the growing importance of Solana in crypto space. As one of the leading blockchains, Solana’s major demand stems from meme coin trading, thanks to its seamless user experience. According to Messari’s State of Solana Q1 2025 report , Pump.fun, a platform on the Solana blockchain that enables users to quickly create and trade meme coins, emerged as the top revenue generator for Solana apps in Q1 2025.

BTC BULL While insiders sell out and exchanges implode, BTC Bull charges forward. Built to thrive in chaos, this bull doesn’t flinch when giants fall—it feeds on the panic. High-energy, low-trust markets are its arena. No gloves, no breaks—BTC Bull is charging full throttle toward its new target of raising $6M in its presale. With a powerful tokenomics structure built on a dual system of token burns and airdrops, BTC BULL is making waves in crypto space. The platform rewards users with real Bitcoin when key milestones are reached, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K in Bitcoin’s value. One of the famous crypto YouTubers, ClayBro , has predicted that there could be a massive rise in the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, with high staking rewards, BTC BULL offers users a chance to earn passively—whether one is a beginner or an experienced trader—while benefiting from the strength and longevity of Bitcoin, the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. Conclusion Coinbase may recover and address the breach, but the impact extends beyond stolen data or temporary stock declines—it challenges trust, which rebuilds slowly. In an industry where future breaches remain a risk, resilience depends on vigilance. The best crypto to buy now includes projects designed with decentralized frameworks and community-driven security, reducing reliance on centralized weak points. While established platforms address vulnerabilities, strategic investors are shifting focus to protocols that emphasize transparency, robust infrastructure, and long-term viability.

2025-05-18T15:30:30.000Z,"XRP’s Surge to $50? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Bitcoin Could Be the Next to Explode","Introduction With XRP’s price continuing to climb and speculation mounting around a possible futures-driven breakout, crypto investors are expanding their focus to the next batch of high-upside candidates. While XRP’s potential move toward $50 has the spotlight, analysts are pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, Litecoin , and Bitcoin as stealth contenders that could soon erupt in value . Here’s how these four coins are quietly positioning for explosive gains in 2025 — and why the momentum is shifting fast. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground in Crypto Circles As XRP gains momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own wave — only earlier in the curve. This politically aligned, community-driven token has caught the attention of early-stage investors, particularly as Stage 8 nears closure and listing price targets remain locked at $0.007 . The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its unique trifecta: A powerful narrative that resonates with a politically active base A clean, capped structure with strong tokenomics A realistic 25x–35x upside window for those entering before exchange listings begin With many early-stage altcoins suffering from weak demand or overcomplication, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something simpler: clarity, traction, and timing . And that’s exactly what savvy investors are acting on right now. Cardano (ADA) Quietly Sets Up for a Breakout Cardano (ADA) has remained relatively quiet compared to Ethereum or Solana — but behind the scenes, it’s been building. Now trading between $0.73–$0.80 , ADA is holding strong support and beginning to attract momentum traders eyeing a break above $1.00 . Recent upgrades and a continued focus on research-first development have kept Cardano’s fundamentals strong. Analysts see a move toward $1.50–$2.00 as possible if market sentiment remains bullish and capital rotation into Layer-1s accelerates. While ADA isn’t grabbing headlines, it’s consistently been one of the best-performing L1s during full cycles — and that makes it a name worth watching again. Litecoin (LTC) Bounces Back from ETF Delay After falling on news of a delayed spot ETF decision , Litecoin (LTC) is now trading near $82 — but sentiment is recovering. The coin remains one of the longest-standing crypto assets, with a loyal holder base and real merchant adoption. If an LTC spot ETF gets the green light in 2025, many believe this legacy coin could revisit previous highs in the $300–$400 range , giving it one of the highest risk-reward profiles among established coins. Litecoin is often overlooked — but its consistent presence and upcoming catalysts make it a dark horse in the coming altcoin wave . Bitcoin Eyes the Next Leg of the Supercycle With current support holding near $103,000 , Bitcoin is building energy for what many analysts believe could be a breakout toward $150,000 or even $250,000 before the year is out. ETF inflows remain strong, and institutional strategies are evolving from exploratory to aggressive. Bitcoin’s reduced volatility and maturing reputation as a macro hedge give it an even greater edge as traditional investors seek exposure. As altcoins move in rhythm with BTC dominance, any upward breakout from Bitcoin could create a domino effect across the rest of the market — especially projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano, which thrive in bullish conditions. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion While XRP continues to steal the spotlight with $50 targets on the table, savvy investors are diversifying into other top contenders that show similar potential — only at earlier stages. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-reward asymmetric entry , while Cardano, Litecoin, and Bitcoin each offer structural strength and upcoming catalysts that could trigger massive upside. With Stage 8 heating up and the broader market showing strength, this could be the moment to lock in the plays that lead the next crypto moonshot.

2025-05-18T15:26:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Hitting $250,000 In 2025 Is ‘Totally Possible’, According To Popular Crypto Pundit","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up to skyrocket to $250,000 this year. In a recent interview , crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Streets, highlighted increasing institutional interest and waning volatility as key catalysts that could propel the price of the premier crypto higher. “$250K this year, totally possible,” Melker posited, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped drastically in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Melker mentioned increasing participation from pension funds and exchange-traded fund issuers as evidence of a more mature and stable market. According to the analyst, the reduced volatility mirrors a wider trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” the Wolf of All Streets explained. “Extremely Bullish Backdrop” The crypto market has been on a tear so far this year. Bitcoin has recently rebounded above the $105,000 mark, while Ethereum (ETH) jumped back above $2,500. Coinbase’s inclusion in the broad-market S&P 500 stock index is a significant milestone for the crypto industry, providing millions of average investors and model portfolios with exposure to a crypto-focused company. The S&P 500 tracks 500 of the biggest publicly traded companies in the United States across different sectors, including tech, healthcare, finance, etc. Notable names in the index include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Melker observed that Coinbase is not just joining the index, but is becoming one of the top 50 companies by market cap, indicating how entrenched some crypto firms have become. Moreover, other crypto-centric companies like Galaxy Digital and eToro are going public, a sign of growing confidence in the regulatory atmosphere under the Trump regime. The pundit believes that this environment, buoyed by dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits and pro-crypto executive orders, has created what he deems “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the industry. Despite being optimistic, Melker still noted that most analysts are generally predicting cycle peaks between $120,000 and $150,000. Nevertheless, he stressed that parabolic rallies are not uncommon in the crypto world. “From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-hitting-250000-in-2025-is-totally-possible-according-to-popular-crypto-pundit/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin entered into a consolidation after the latest price surge, leading to minor price pullbacks. BTC registered a bearish weekly candle for the first time in the past six weeks. However, many retail investors feel disappointed, probably because the recent momentum did not push BTC above the existing all-time high. In his latest podcast , a renowned crypto analyst berated the retailers’ reaction following the slight pullback in the crypto market.

2025-05-18T15:11:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC’s Consolidation Phase Nearing Its End?","Bitcoin has continued consolidating below the critical $108K resistance range, signaling a state of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, the price is likely to initiate a fresh rally once the current corrective consolidation phase concludes. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase after failing to reclaim the key $108K resistance zone. This price behavior suggests that profit-taking is occurring at this crucial level, increasing selling pressure and triggering a mild retracement. However, Bitcoin still exhibits strong bullish momentum, evidenced by its recent impulsive moves toward this resistance. As such, once the ongoing consolidation ends, a renewed bullish surge is expected. The price may retrace further toward the key $98K–$100K support range, where new demand is likely to enter and fuel the next rally. This could pave the way for a fresh attempt at a new all-time high in the mid-term. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, BTC continues to trade within a short-term ascending channel, forming higher highs and higher lows—an indication of a bullish structure. The recent consolidation has led to a pullback toward the channel’s lower boundary at $100K, a major psychological support level. If this support holds, a rapid rebound toward the $109K ATH appears likely. However, if the price breaks below the channel, the consolidation could extend further, with a decline toward the $98K support range becoming the probable scenario. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s next move hinges on how the price behaves around the ascending channel’s lower boundary. On-chain Analysis Bitcoin’s interaction with the Realized Price of long-term holders’ UTXOs has historically served as a reliable indicator of market direction, as it reflects the average acquisition cost of these key investors. This metric often acts as a dynamic support or resistance level. Currently, Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, suggesting that these important market participants are now in overall profit. This development is typically seen as a bullish signal. However, a short-term corrective retracement toward this level, currently around $98K, remains a likely scenario, as the market consolidates and searches for fresh demand. The $98K zone stands as a critical support range. A strong rebound from this level could confirm it as a solid foundation and potentially ignite a fresh uptrend, aiming for a new all-time high.

According to Russian news site TASS, citing law enforcement agencies, the Zamoskvoretsky District Court granted an investigator’s request to detain Smerkis for alleged fraud. Details regarding the charges remain unclear. The agency’s interlocutor cited Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

2025-05-18T15:01:59.000Z,"Here’s when Bitcoin’s bear market is set to start","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) inches closer to a potential new all-time high, possibly $120,000, an analyst is cautioning that the current bull market may be approaching its final stretch. According to MasterAnanda, Bitcoin is confronting its final major resistance level before entering full price discovery. This level could cap the current rally, with a market top likely in late 2025 and a downturn following, he said in a TradingView post on May 18. MasterAnanda pinpointed the resistance zone between $120,000 and $130,000, levels that align with projections from fellow analyst Tradingshot , who anticipates Bitcoin hitting $130,000 by June 2025, as reported by Finbold. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView However, a significant mid-cycle correction in this range could suppress Bitcoin’s upside potential. For the cryptocurrency to reach its full bullish target, potentially between $180,000 and $220,000, the trading expert suggested that any meaningful pullback should ideally occur later, around the $150,000 to $160,000 range. Based on his outlook, Bitcoin’s bull run could extend through November 2025, giving the market another six months of upward momentum before a bear phase potentially sets in. “We are still in May month #5 and the minimum we can expect growth is until November month #11 which gives us 6 months. 6 months of straight up is a very long time. With a 2-3 months correction now it isn’t that long,” he said. Bitcoin’s play above $200,000 Adding to the bullish outlook, pseudonymous crypto analyst Thescalpingpro in an X post on May 18, projected a cycle peak of $207,701. The target is based on historical trends and technical indicators, particularly the Fibonacci extension levels. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Thescalpingpro In the previous bull market, Bitcoin peaked at the 3.618 Fibonacci extension. Now, BTC remains below the 1.618 level, with the next major resistance at the 2.618 extension near $154,522. If this level is breached, the analyst expects the 3.618 level, at $207,701, to act as the final resistance. Bitcoin price analysis At the moment, Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $105,000 resistance level, which is critical in setting the stage for a new all-time high above the previous record of nearly $110,000. As of press time, BTC was trading at $104,665, up almost 2% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

2025-05-18T14:58:31.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Bull Run Picks: These 5 XRP, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Plays Could See 10,000% Returns","Introduction As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside . While BTC itself may dominate headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward. From established names like XRP and Ethereum to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Hedera (HBAR) , a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for potential 10,000% returns this cycle — especially as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are five breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin’s shadow. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 Among the newest altcoin contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a powerful reputation as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity . With a listing target of $0.007 and significant market traction already underway, many analysts are now viewing it as a realistic 25x–35x setup — and some models forecast even more extreme upside if momentum continues post-listing. What’s setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart isn’t just the branding — it’s the intense demand , clear tokenomics , and a community-first launch strategy that’s working. With the current presale nearing a critical close, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure exposure at sub-penny levels before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . Strategically, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers what other tokens at this stage rarely do: a combination of viral narrative , early entry pricing , and realistic price targets in the months ahead. Ethereum Prepares for a New Institutional Wave Ethereum (ETH) is quietly consolidating near $2,600 , but beneath the surface, a storm is brewing. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved throughput, and analysts expect Ethereum ETF approvals to mirror Bitcoin’s earlier success. ETH has long been seen as crypto’s infrastructure layer — but now, it’s being recognized as a prime institutional asset . Forecasts place ETH in the $4,000–$6,000 range by late 2025, with higher targets possible if ETF demand snowballs. With upgrades complete and DeFi once again heating up, Ethereum is no longer just a Layer-1 — it’s a Wall Street asset in the making. XRP’s Futures Launch Could Spark a Historic Repricing XRP has reclaimed its position above $2.30 , and with the CME Futures launch imminent , it’s one of the most closely-watched names in the market. Legal clarity in the U.S. has opened the door to broader institutional use, and payment-driven demand is fueling renewed optimism. Many analysts now forecast XRP moving beyond $5 in the short term — and in long-term scenarios, $15–$30 price levels are being discussed if ETF approvals and liquidity integrations play out as expected. With global financial rails being reshaped, XRP is quietly becoming the infrastructure token for real-world settlement. HBAR’s Technical Breakout Has Analysts on Alert Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently broke out from a long consolidation, rallying over 40% in early May before settling around $0.211 . The surge came after key ecosystem announcements and growing attention from enterprise partners — sectors where Hedera remains uniquely strong. HBAR is one of the few altcoins that consistently aligns with corporate-scale adoption , and technical analysts are watching for a break past $0.23 , which could unlock a path toward $0.40 and beyond . It’s not flashy — but it’s reliable. And in a market increasingly seeking real-world value, HBAR’s structure makes it a strong long-term hold. Bitcoin’s Role as Catalyst — and Gatekeeper While these altcoins capture the upside narrative, Bitcoin remains the catalyst that triggers rotation . With current prices holding above $103,000 , BTC continues to draw institutional inflows and is setting the tone for what could be a historic 2025 cycle . Should Bitcoin break through $110,000 and push toward analyst targets of $250,000 , it could unleash a massive altcoin wave — particularly in undervalued assets with strong positioning like MAGACOIN FINANCE and HBAR. For many investors, Bitcoin is the foundation. But the biggest returns are increasingly found in the layers that follow . CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the stage for a powerful second-half surge in 2025, the spotlight is now shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Ethereum and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE and HBAR provide early entry opportunities with outsized return potential. Investors who are rotating now — before listings finalize and media attention catches up — may be best positioned to benefit from the kind of explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

2025-05-18T14:57:47.000Z,"XRP Price at Risk of Crashing 50%, Here’s Why","The post XRP Price at Risk of Crashing 50%, Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s an exciting weekend for crypto fans, and especially for those watching XRP closely. There’s been an update about Ripple’s case with the SEC, and while it’s not terrible news, it’s not great either. According to an analyst, right now, XRP is trading around $2.43 — but the situation feels a bit shaky. Over the past three days, XRP tried to break through a key resistance level at $2.62, but it failed every single time. This isn’t a good sign because if buyers and big investors (like institutions) were strong in the market, XRP should have easily crossed that point. Even worse, instead of moving up, the price actually dropped below $2.50 yesterday. At this stage, the market is leaning a little more bearish rather than bullish. According to the analysis, for XRP to look positive again, it needs to climb back above $2.50 — and ideally break past $2.62 with strong buying support. If XRP continues to stay above $2.30, things are still under control. But if it falls below that level, traders should be ready for the price to drop closer to $2.00. That’s why the $2.30 support level is so important right now. Be Ready for All Possibilities Despite these short-term worries, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive. Many still believe XRP could reach $10 by mid-2026 and even dream of a $100 price in the next five to ten years. But the road there won’t be smooth. The crypto market is famously unpredictable. Prices can surge or crash without warning, and history shows that bull runs can be short-lived. While some believe the bull market might already be over after Bitcoin touched $110,000 and altcoins had their moment, others remain optimistic.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-at-risk-of-crashing-50-heres-why/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Investors Are Betting Big Before Stage 8 Closes","Introduction As the crypto market charges into Q2 2025, momentum is building around a select group of assets showing both strength and strategic upside. Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance , Solana is on an 80% rally , and a new wave of investors is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising political altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With major players like AVAX attracting institutional attention, the altcoin market is entering a fresh phase of speculation, strategy, and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Can $500 today really grow into $1 million during this cycle? Let’s break down the leaders that are catching the market’s attention right now — and the altcoin that’s turning heads just before Stage 8 closes. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm above $103,000–$104,000 , with analysts projecting a run to $250,000 by the end of 2025 . The bullish outlook stems from a confluence of major factors: spot ETF adoption , record pension fund inflows , and reduced volatility . Scott Melker and other analysts are calling this cycle the most structurally sound yet, with long-term holders increasing and new institutional vehicles providing serious capital flow into BTC. The current chart shows a bullish retest , with rising lows — typically a precursor to an explosive move upward. As legacy finance integrates crypto, Bitcoin continues to stand as the macro anchor of the next bull cycle . Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 While Bitcoin leads the charge, early-stage investors are turning heads toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-rising altcoin that’s gaining traction ahead of its $0.007 listing target . As Stage 8 nears completion , MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the highest ROI opportunities of the year. With each stage selling out rapidly, the momentum is unmistakable — and analysts are starting to label it a 35x contender in the 2025 cycle. Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on every radar: Massive demand with exponential early traction Political narrative that resonates deeply with retail and community-driven investors Clear roadmap and token utility backed by rising investor momentum Crypto analysts are now suggesting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could do what early SHIBA INU and DOGE once did — but with stronger positioning and clearer upside strategy . The timing ahead of listings is becoming critical. AVAX Surges as Institutional Flows and Gaming Deals Spark Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is up 3.2% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $28.35 , with renewed volume pouring in during the Avalanche Summit 2025 . The event showcased Avalanche’s growing role in institutional finance and GameFi , including a major partnership with MapleStory . What really caught attention is BlackRock’s involvement in recent development talks — a major credibility signal for AVAX’s role in Web3. With new onchain trading tools and expanding real-world integrations , analysts are calling Avalanche “seriously undervalued” heading into the summer. Solana’s 80% Rally Positions It as the Cycle’s Breakout Layer-1 Solana (SOL) has surged more than 80% from recent lows, now trading in the $165–$180 range. It’s quickly becoming the top performer among major altcoins , thanks to its thriving DeFi ecosystem and developer-first architecture . Forecasts suggest short-term consolidation around $162–$171 , with long-term targets pushing toward $250–$400 . With consistent protocol upgrades and growing adoption, Solana is proving it has staying power as a serious Ethereum alternative. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge , Solana’s high-velocity rally , and AVAX’s institutional momentum , crypto’s next cycle is already taking shape. But among all of these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential . With a clear listing roadmap, strong investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing — and smart investors are already taking notice.

2025-05-18T14:30:46.000Z,"On-Chain Data Tips Bitcoin To Peak At $120,000 – But On This Condition","Bitcoin prices have registered impressive gains in recent weeks amidst an ongoing price rebound. Since dipping below the $75,000 mark in mid-April, the asset’s price has jumped by over 37.5% to trade as high as $105,490. While the BTC market appears to be cooling off, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has tipped the premier cryptocurrency to hit a market top of $120,000 before the current bull cycle runs out. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now CVDD Metrics Hint At $120k Peak, But Only If $90k Support Holds The Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) is an on-chain metric that measures the total coin-days destroyed when dormant BTC moves, thus capturing the spending activity of long-term holders. Basically, a surge in CVDD indicates significant profit-taking by long-term holders, which is often an indicator of overheated market conditions. Meanwhile, reduced CVDD action marks accumulation phases. Based on the chart presented by Martinez, prominent analytics firm CryptoQuant extrapolates Bitcoin’s current CVDD at $34,154 into multiple layers, each representing different aspects of the bull market. Firstly, there is the Accessing Tops, i.e, the black line which extrapolates the CVDD into an upper band that the price has reached at the major tops, such as at $20,000 in 2017 and $69,000 and 2021. Presently, the Accessing Tops is around $120,000, suggesting this could be the next market peak of this bull run. Another important layer in CryptoQuant’s extrapolation of the CVDD is the Accumulating Phase 2, the second-tier support band that has repeatedly underpinned price throughout 2025. It is presently positioned at $90,000, marking the first major support line for bulls. With the present Bitcoin price at $103,242, Ali Martinez warns that preserving the price support at $90,000 is critical to maintaining Bitcoin’s bull structure and enabling a potential rise to $120,000.

Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 17.92%, indicating a fall in market participation. Presently, the next resistance level stands at $105,000. However, Martinez has stated that major positive developments will only follow when a price close above $107,000 is achieved. Meanwhile, bullish sentiments remain high as illustrated by another impressive performance by the Bitcoin Spot ETFs, which registered a net inflow of $1.81 billion in the past week. With a market cap of $2.04 trillion, Bitcoin continues to remain the most valuable digital asset, holding about 62.8% of the crypto market.

2025-05-18T14:30:30.000Z,"China Dumps $18,900,000,000 in Treasuries as US Government Faces Major Dilemma: Macro Analyst Luke Gromen","China sold off billions of dollars worth of US Treasuries between February and March, according to recent government data. Data from the Treasury Department shows that China’s US Treasury (UST) holdings dropped $18.9 billion in one month, while most other countries increased their holdings. The data also shows that the UK has overtaken China and is now the second-biggest foreign holder of USTs in the world. Japan remains the biggest holder of USTs in the world, currently holding $1.13 trillion, down from $1.16 trillion a year prior. Macro investor Luke Gromen warns that the countries buying more USTs won’t be able to simultaneously buy more American-manufactured goods, further hurting America’s trade deficit that President Trump has promised to address. Says Gromen, “Foreign UST holdings rose $133 billion Mar vs. Feb. UK, Caymans, and Canada were $86 billion of that $133 billion; China sold $19 billion. UK surpassed China as the 2nd biggest US foreign creditor for 1st time ever in March. Cayman Islands (pop. ~73,000) is now the fourth biggest US foreign creditor at $455 billion… How are they going to buy both USTs and more goods from America going forward?” Analysts reportedly told Reuters that Chinese holdings of USTs have been in a downward trajectory since 2018, even though foreign holdings of Treasuries surged to an all-time high of $9.05 trillion in March.

2025-05-18T14:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin stalls, but chart watchers eye $300,000 peak: Here’s when","Bitcoin price has stalled below $105,000, but a popular model points to a surge to between $275,000 and $300,000 by October this year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $103,400 at press time, a few points below this month’s high of $105,900. The Bitcoin Spiral Clock is a popular model that looks at Bitcoin price cycles around halving events. Halving is a process where Bitcoin’s rewards are slashed by half in a bid to control the supply of new coins entering circulation. It happens after every 210,000 blocks are mined, which happens after four years. The spiral clock shows the historical price peaks and crashes. As shown below, Bitcoin stands at block 896,988, meaning that it is about 3:15 on the clock. The clock then predicts that Bitcoin will peak between $270,000 and $300,000 by October this year. The higher side of the prediction implies a 191% surge from the current level. have you studied this chart intensely? do you understand it? pic.twitter.com/mkryGtjbDI — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) May 16, 2025 Bitcoin has some bullish catalysts in the coming months. First, Moody’s became the third major ratings agency to slash US credit rating , citing its soaring debt and fiscal mismanagement. A credit rating is seen as bullish for Bitcoin because it has emerged as a safe-haven asset. For example, Bitcoin outperformed stocks and other assets after Donald Trump launched his tariffs in April. Also, unlike the US dollar, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, making it less inflationary.

The iShares Bitcoin ETF has accumulated over $65 billion in assets and is nearing the SPDR Gold Trust, which has over $90 billion. Bitcoin demand also comes from institutions, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy having 568,840 coins in its balance sheet. Other firms like Next Technology, Bitfarms, and Semler Scientific have also boosted their holdings. Conversely, the supply of Bitcoin in exchanges and over-the-counter markets has continued to fall. Therefore, the confluence of falling supply and rising demand means that Bitcoin will likely keep rising. Top analysts are also highly bullish on Bitcoin, with BlackRock aiming for $700,000 and Standard Chartered predicting that it will hit $200,000 by the end of the year. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin’s price has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months and is now nearing the key resistance level at $109,230, its all-time high. Since October 2023, the 50-week Exponential Moving Average has supported Bitcoin, which has also formed an ascending channel. Therefore, more gains will be confirmed if it moves above $109,230, as doing that will invalidate the double-top pattern whose neckline is at the 50-week moving average at $81,210. Such a move will point to more gains, potentially to the upper side of the channel at $134,556.

2025-05-18T14:09:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Could Hit $250K by End of 2025, Says Analyst Scott Melker","Crypto analyst Scott Melker believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025, driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker shared his outlook in a recent interview , pointing to reduced volatility and deeper integration with traditional finance as catalysts for the next major rally. “$250K this year totally possible,” Melker said, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Pension Funds and ETFs Fuel Bitcoin’s Shift Toward Market Stability Melker attributed the shift to increased involvement from pension funds and exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, describing a more stable environment as long-term investors replace short-term speculators. The arrival of institutional players, he said, has changed Bitcoin’s profile from a high-risk asset to a potential portfolio cornerstone. Signs of renewed strength have already emerged. In May, Bitcoin climbed above $104,000, while Ethereum moved past $2,600. The rally was accompanied by broader market gains, including surges in smaller-cap altcoins — a trend Melker said indicates new capital entering the space. The sector also saw a symbolic victory when Coinbase was added to the S&P 500, entering the benchmark index within its top 50 by market cap. Melker called it a clear signal that crypto firms are gaining legitimacy in traditional financial circles. Additional momentum has come from firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro, which continue to pursue public listings amid a more favorable regulatory landscape. Melker referenced recent developments, including paused enforcement actions by the SEC and pro-crypto signals from the White House, as factors contributing to what he described as “an extremely bullish backdrop.” Still, not all forecasts are as aggressive. Most analysts expect Bitcoin to peak between $120,000 and $150,000 this cycle. But Melker noted that unpredictable upside moves are part of the market’s history. “From the 2020 lows to the last peak, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000,” he said. “A 2.5x move from here wouldn’t be a big deal.” Adam Back Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Hit $500K-$1M This Cycle Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. In a recent interview, Back expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s current price level (hovering around $103,300) given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto landscape. Despite being just 5% below its all-time high of nearly $109,000, Back argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. Meanwhile, according to Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, Bitcoin’s recent price stagnation below the $150,000 mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market . He added that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

2025-05-18T13:59:17.000Z,"Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Contracting Supply Set to Push Bitcoin past $200K by the End of 2025","Bitcoin can soon cross the $200K mark due to rapidly contracting supply. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, said that the king cryptocurrency can hit the milestone by the end of 2025, considering demand and supply. Hougan’s rationale is that miners can only produce 165,000 $BTC this year. On the other hand, Strategy alone has bought 379,800 $BTC over the past six months. This means that miners can’t produce enough $BTC to satiate the market’s demand. Moreover, a huge amount of money has been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, with the total now standing at $6B. Add to this governments and corporations also buying $BTC left, right, and center, and we’re witnessing an unforeseen demand for the ‘digital gold.’ Hougan expects that $BTC sellers would stop at $100K, which also happens to be a huge psychological level. Keep reading to learn more about Bitcoin’s brewing rally. We’ll also list down the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from this. Shrinking Bitcoin Supply Michael Saylor’s Strategy has emerged as the most aggressive Bitcoin buyer. The company now holds a whopping 568,840 $BTC worth $59.03B. Because of this, the Bitcoin supply has turned deflationary (-2.33%), as per analyst Ki Young Ju. Simply put, Bitcoin’s supply is decreasing by 2.33% every year. Now, with other firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald’s Twenty One also buying Bitcoin aggressively and governments rushing to form a Bitcoin reserve, this deflationary rate is only expected to increase in the next few years. In other words, Bitcoin could become an asset of the rich with limited supply. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin is not expected to stop even after it reaches $200K. Crypto analyst Scott Melker said in a recent interview that the asset can reach $250K by the end of 2025. Heavy corporate investments have meant that Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years. Earlier, it was about three times more volatile than the S&P 500, but it’s now less than twice as volatile. Decreasing volatility is a strong indication of increasing institutional interest. The more money flows into an asset, the less volatile it becomes. If you, too, want to benefit from Bitcoin’s mighty swing upwards, this might be your last chance. If you’re looking for ideas, here are some of the best cryptos to invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth A Bitcoin rally generally means happy times for the broader crypto (and meme coin) market. However, becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will allow you to make the most of Bitcoin’s growth. That’s because $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto today offering real (and free) $BTC via airdrops to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin reaches a landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive their share of $BTC. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250K this year, meaning you can benefit from at least three $BTC airdrops, depending on when BTC Bull Token goes live. The project is currently in presale, with over $5.9M in early investor funding. Luckily for you, one $BTCBULL is available for just $0.00252. It’s also worth noting that the project’s developers have planned to follow a deflationary model. This simply means that the total $BTCBULL supply will keep reducing – every time $BTC’s price jumps $25K, to be precise – which will likely boost demand. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights A booming crypto market is a launchpad for viral meme coins.

As the name suggests, DOGE’s mission is to assist the second Trump administration by maximizing the productivity of the federal government. Considering that anything Musk touches becomes a fad in crypto, it’s hardly a surprise that $DOGE (not Dogecoin, mind you) has risen to become one of the top trending cryptos . To make the most of its viral bottom line, the $DOGE meme coin offers a few distinct advantages to crypto traders. For instance, you don’t have to pay any fees while buying, selling, or transferring $DOGE. Next, this low-cap coin is now completely owned by the community; the $DOGE owner has given up control over it. $DOGE is up over 140% in the last month or so, including 76% in just the last seven days. It’s currently trading at $0.03318, which, seeing as Trump’s second term is only getting started, could be a great entry point for interested investors. Remember, Even the Best Altcoins Require Sound Risk Management With a Bitcoin rally looking imminent, top altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities thanks to their unique prospects and low prices. However, bear in mind that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you should only risk what you can afford to lose.

2025-05-18T13:46:38.000Z,"Move Over Cardano: 3 Explosive New Crypto Picks","Cardano is back in the headlines with fresh price predictions suggesting it could hit $10 by 2031. Ethereum is surging, Bitcoin is aiming for the $120K mark, and suddenly crypto is alive again. Market watchers are calling for an altcoin season revival, and early signs are everywhere. Dogecoin whales are on the move, gobbling up over $1B Dogecoin over the past month, while XRP has staged a sharp V-shaped rally. Together, these events are creating the perfect cocktail for retail FOMO. The spotlight may be on the big names for now, but smart investors are already looking further down the list – toward the new crypto projects with far more room to run. Altcoin Season 2.0 Is Here – And the Clues Are All Around Us Cardano’s long-term potential is encouraging, but the real action might be coming much sooner and from unexpected places. Ethereum’s recent breakout has reignited bullish momentum across the board. If Bitcoin really is on track to reach $120K , as some analysts suggest, we’re likely heading straight into another altcoin supercycle. The data backs it up. Whale wallets are snapping up meme coins like Dogecoin again – a typical early sign of renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s sharp price surge hints that risk appetite is back in play. Altcoin season isn’t coming – it’s starting. And while top-10 coins will no doubt see gains, history tells us the biggest returns often come from smaller, undervalued projects during these windows of market enthusiasm. From meme-fueled utility to sustainable infrastructure plays, here are three of the best altcoins that could leave Cardano in the dust by the end of 2025. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Powering the Future of Web3 Solaxy ($SOLX) is rewriting the rules of blockchain scalability as the first-ever Layer 2 solution built specifically for Solana. While Ethereum has long dominated the Layer 2 conversation, Solaxy brings that same performance boost to Solana – only faster and with lower fees. At its core, Solaxy neutralizes Solana’s biggest pain points: network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. In return, it amplifies the very things that made Solana popular – blazing speed and dirt-cheap fees. RIght now, you can buy $SOLX for $0.001728. With over $37M raised in presale, $SOLX is gaining serious traction. It’s a multichain token launching on both Ethereum and Solana, giving it direct access to the two largest ecosystems in crypto. That means more liquidity, more users, and more upside potential. But Solaxy isn’t just another scaling solution – it’s a bridge to the next generation of DeFi. It connects Ethereum’s massive asset tokenization and DeFi infrastructure with Solana’s high-speed environment. $SOLX also unlocks meme coin trading for the masses by democratizing access to high-frequency trading tools, leveling the playing field for everyday users. And in a market heating up with surging meme coins and revived altcoin appetite, Solaxy looks like a perfect storm of utility, access, and timing. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Where Memes Meet AI Mind of Pepe ($MIND) isn’t just riding the meme coin hype – it’s steering the ship with an AI-powered rocket strapped to the back. At the heart of this project is the first-ever self-evolving, crypto-native AI agent designed to interact directly with the crypto world on platforms like X . It analyzes trends, generates content, and even influences market conversation. Think of it like a meme-savvy ChatGPT with a mission to make its holders rich. Already active and engaging users, this AI agent does more than just chat. It offers trading insights, tracks market trends, and delivers exclusive alpha to $MIND holders through token-gated community channels. It even has the power to launch its own tokens and give early access to holders – a massive edge in today’s fast-paced meme coin environment. With $9.5M already raised in its presale and the launch just two weeks away, timing couldn’t be better. The broader AI token market is up 60% this month, and $MIND is set to launch into full-blown bullish conditions. Currently priced at $0.0037515, $MIND’s price could soar to $0.00535 in 2025 – and potentially 10x by 2030 if momentum holds. As Dogecoin whales re-enter the market and meme coin mania builds, $MIND is perfectly placed to capitalize. 3. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – The Intelligent Meme Coin Dawgz AI is where meme culture meets serious trading tech – a perfect storm for altcoin season. Priced at just $0.004 with the next presale tier set to increase it to $0.00438, $DAGZ has already raised $3.6M and is building momentum fast. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, this project is backed by a real AI engine designed to make smart trading decisions in real time. The Dawgz AI trading bot scans the market 24/7, using on-chain data and social sentiment to identify profitable opportunities. It then feeds this intel into a user-friendly dashboard that helps traders take action quickly. Even if you’re new to crypto, $DAGZ makes it easy to trade like a pro by simplifying data into clear signals and automating execution. But it’s not all bots and charts – Dawgz AI also knows how to have fun. The project has built a strong, engaged community with meme contests, giveaways, and a loyal pack of retail investors who believe this could be the next big breakout in the meme coin + AI niche. With Dogecoin whales stirring and retail energy coming back into the market, $DAGZ may be in the right place at exactly the right time. New Faces, Bigger Upside? Cardano may be grabbing headlines, but newcomers like Solaxy , Mind of Pepe , and Dawgz AI are where the real fireworks could happen in 2025. Each project brings something fresh – from multichain DeFi infrastructure to meme-fueled AI and smart trading automation. As altcoin season heats up, these three could leave the old giants in the dust. This article is for informational purposes only and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

This comes after witnessing a week of fluctuations. The rise in Bitcoin’s dominance, in a way, pressured altcoins to perform as retail investors are still absent. However, the stock markets and crypto remained nearly correlated. The ongoing 90-day tariff pause between the US and China has markets within striking distance of their all-time highs. Meanwhile, Moody’s delivered a shock downgrade to the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. It cited soaring deficits and a mounting debt burden. S&P, BTC, gold near ATHs As per the data, S&P 500 is trading at a current price of $5,958 after setting its all-time high of $6,147 on February 19, 2025. It is only 3.27% away from its ATH. Gold is also trading around $3,200 per ounce, after posting its ATH of $3,509 on April 22, 2025. The precious metal is just 9% out from hitting its fresh ATH. A Goldman Sachs report stated that investors have been increasing their holdings of gold since March. It was driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and a surprising surge in demand from central banks. But not all moves have made sense to investors. The recent 5% drop in gold prices , which mirrors a fall in equities, confused some investors. The analyst suggests that gold’s status as a haven asset hasn’t gone anywhere. As stocks sank, investors sold gold to raise cash for collateral, not because they lost faith in it. On the traditional market side, a bullish sentiment is spreading among investors.

Bitcoin hovers near $104K Soft US inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cuts have managed to keep the crypto market up and going. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index also improved market sentiment. Bitcoin price hovered around $103k-$104k over the past week.

2025-05-18T13:00:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Could Be Preparing For Fresh Wave Of Volatility — Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price action over the weekend has been quite sluggish, reflecting the indecision and fatigue seemingly hovering over the cryptocurrency market at the moment. After a dour performance during the week, the premier cryptocurrency has continued to trade within the $92,000 – $95,000 range on Saturday, May 17. With the choppy price action, doubt about the Bitcoin price reclaiming its all-time high of $108,786 is starting to creep in. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader could be gearing up for significant price movements over the next few weeks. Open Interest Metric Predicts What’s Next For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Alphractal delved into fresh on-chain observations revolving around the price of Bitcoin and the open interest (OI) cycle. According to the market intelligence firm, the BTC open interest data is exhibiting certain patterns that have coincided with major price moves in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Typically, the open interest metric measures the total amount of money flowing into BTC derivatives at any given period. Meanwhile, the OI Delta indicator estimates changes in the open interest over a specific timeframe. Firstly, Alphractal highlighted that the 30-day Open Interest Delta recently reached the same levels seen during the Bitcoin price rise to its previous all-time high around $73,737 in 2024. This pattern shows that the BTC market could be at the beginning of a cyclical behavioral change. Alphractal said: A familiar pattern is emerging: alternating cycles of increase and decrease in the Open Interest Delta — what we might call Phase 1 and Phase 2. After a strong buildup of positions (positive Delta), we often see a nearly proportional drop (negative Delta), showing clear cyclical behavior in the market. Furthermore, Alphractal noted that the 180-day Open Interest Delta offers a more interesting insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory in the coming weeks. According to the market intelligence firm, a negative 180-day OI Delta metric is usually associated with a market bottom or an accumulation trend. As shown in the chart above, the 180-day Open Interest Delta sits just above the negative territory, which suggests that the Bitcoin price could witness increased volatility in the coming weeks. However, it is worth mentioning that a cross beneath the zero threshold could also signal the start of a new consolidation phase. Alphractal concluded on X: Overall, Open Interest has not grown proportionally like it did from October 2023 to early 2024 — and again from October 2024 into early 2025. These yearly patterns may suggest a fractal behavior in investor risk appetite. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,367, reflecting a 0.4% decline in the past 24 hours.

Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative. Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

According to reports, the woman, in her 40s, carried out the theft while her boyfriend was sleeping. Prosecutors did not reveal the name of the perpetrator during the trial. According to reports , the accused woman stole around 683 million won, worth approximately $488,000. She carried out the theft in January, with the sentencing being carried out this week. During her trial, the woman was also convicted on charges of embezzlement after it was discovered she also stole 2 million won in cash, worth about $1,430. The news was reported by local media in South Korea. South Korean woman sent to jail for crypto theft According to the authorities, the crime occurred at 11:50 PM at her boyfriend’s house in Jeju City, South Korea, on January 5. They said that the woman had carefully memorized her boyfriend’s login details in the hopes that she would access his account when he went to bed. While he was sleeping, the woman took his phone and used his bank apps and exchanges to transfer funds to her personal accounts. Authorities mentioned that after stealing the money, the South Korean woman fled the location, boarding a plane to another part of the country. She had the intention of staying there and enjoying the stolen funds. However, things did not go the way she had thought as the police nabbed her at a hotel near Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province. She was subsequently arrested and moved back to Jeju City to answer for her crimes. According to the details of the case, the woman admitted to the charges, noting that she carried out the criminal act on January 5 while her boyfriend was sleeping. She also mentioned that she had returned most of the funds, noting that she only owes around 21.9 million won, worth about $15,000. The woman also asked the court for leniency because she had returned part of the funds and is remorseful about her actions. Uptick in crypto-related crimes causes concerns The media in South Korea mentioned that the court refused her plea of leniency because she is a repeat offender, given her history of fraud, and the amount of money owed was still substantial. The case was handled by the court in Jeju province, South Korea. The woman’s legal representatives also urged the courts for mercy, citing their client’s remorse and her actions towards refunding the stolen funds. They argued that the woman owes a smaller amount of money compared to what she originally stole on January 5. The court, during the announcement of the verdict, mentioned that the woman was a repeat offender. The court said she had two previous convictions for fraud, with one of them heading to trial before she stole her boyfriend’s digital assets. The judge refused to consider her plea or give her a second chance because she had repeatedly been given second chances, which she has continually wasted. The judge handed her a two-year jail term. The conviction adds to an increasing number of crypto-related crimes in Jeju and globally, as peer-to-peer trades are now leading to theft, assault, and even murder. In January, a man in his 30s was found stabbed to death in a hotel in Jeju after travelling there to attend a private crypto meeting. In another case, four Chinese nationals were apprehended for stealing $63,000 in digital assets. The same month, 22-year-old Maissa Jebali was arrested for stealing TRUMP meme coins from her ex-boyfriend.

2025-05-18T12:36:44.000Z,"Dogecoin On-Chain Activity Nears 6-Month High. $1 DOGE Price Target Confirmed","Major cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is looking to revive its fortunes amid a sudden surge in on-chain activity. The 8th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been steadily regaining lost ground in the last couple of weeks, following a major downturn in proceedings in the cryptocurrency markets in general and DOGE in particular. DOGE is the world’s first meme coin and one of the oldest digital currencies, dating back to 2014. It started as a joke as the founder, Billy Markus, copied Bitcoin’s code to start a network but changed the font to Comic Sans, which is used in the popular Shiba dog meme. But, with time, the meme coin sector started to attract major attention in the crypto community, peaking during the 2020-2021 bull market when the digital currency rose a spectacular 600000% in just a few months, leaving crypto traders in awe. DOGE’s incredible success powered a massive foray into the meme coin economy that still sees dozens of new tokens released daily. However, DOGE’s major exploits during the 2020-2021 bull market haven’t been replicated in the 2024-2025 edition. The cryptocurrency has yet to come close to the $0.7 All-Time High price point, and if it fails to do so, a major rally will remain elusive. On-chain Activity Surge Nevertheless, a recent surge in the cryptocurrency network’s on-chain activity may spark the bullish forces. According to popular X influencer Ali Martinez, over 280,000 active addresses have been witnessed in the last couple of days, showing strong improvement in on-chain activity. The flurry of blockchain network undertakings is now reaching new six-month highs. Here is the graph shared by Martinez: Image Source: X Price Trend Here is the graph of DOGE from the last couple of months or so: The coin is trading around $0.224, up from $0.17 just a week ago. According to top analysts, a major boost is needed in the ensuing months if the $1 price target is to be realized in the coming months. Analysts are confident that the $1 goal is achievable, and the meme coin economy’s continued short-term exploits mean that the joke token sector is here to stay. However, a move similar to 2020-2021 may not be expected. Overall, DOGE is scheduled to cement itself among the Top Ten cryptocurrencies during this bull market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-on-chain-activity-nears-6-month-high-1-doge-price-target-confirmed/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin",cryptocompare

Broadcasting live data from the exchange it was opened on – Hyperliquid, CoinGlass’s live feed shows that the liquidation price is set at $95,576. A WHALE JUST OPENED $276 MILLION 40X LONG POSITION ON BITCOIN THE LIQUIDATION PRICE IS $95,000 WHALE OR INSIDER ? pic.twitter.com/79Aopmbl1m — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 17, 2025 Numerous crypto content creators and influencers picked up the massive position on Saturday evening, which at first was worth a more modest $276 million. The initial entry price was $103,129. However, live data from CoinGlass shows that the mysterious whale capitalized on a brief opportunity they had when bitcoin’s price slipped below $103,000 to double down on their position, which is now worth over $393 million (3,790 BTC). The entry price has been lowered to $103,083, but the liquidation still stands at just shy of $95,600. Given BTC’s current price tag of almost $104,000, the whale stands on a “modest” unrealized profit of $3.3 million as of now. There have been quite a few cases in the past couple of months in which mysterious whales opened large positions on Hyperliquid that caught the community’s attention. Recall another example from March this year when someone opened a massive multi-million-dollar short position. Later, popular crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed that this was William Parker, a UK individual linked to a $1 million casino theft among other scandals. According to the reports, Parker profited around $20 million by using extremely high leverage to open positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which allowed him to manipulate the market.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7585 Market Cap $26.79 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $774.59M Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7683 24-hour Low $0.7295 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.18% 50-day SMA $ 0.688835 14-Day RSI 50.67 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the token is currently trading near $0.757, and shows a modest upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.84, meaning that the coin is in a neutral momentum with potential room for further gains before reaching overbought territory. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, and the price is trending above the middle band, which often indicates bullish continuation. The upper band resistance around $0.854 may act as a short-term ceiling. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could target the $0.90 zone. Support lies near $0.741. Momentum appears cautiously bullish pending a decisive breakout or rejection. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the price is currently trading at approximately $0.759, nestled between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands. This suggests a neutral-to-bullish posture but lacks strong directional momentum. The MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line and signal line dipping below the zero axis, hinting at potential short-term weakness. The Balance of Power (BoP) reads negative, pointing to a slight bearish pressure in recent sessions. If the price breaks below $0.737, a correction toward $0.70 may follow. However, maintaining above $0.764 could preserve the bullish structure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.71118 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.768671 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.787472 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.744714 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.688835 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.723624 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.679917 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.723315 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.696251 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.674927 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.681013 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.721942 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.756792 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.725817 BUY What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts of Cardano (ADA), the asset currently demonstrates a neutral-to-cautiously bullish setup. On the daily chart, ADA is trading near $0.757, slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating an effort to recover upward momentum. The RSI hovers around 59, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment without overbought pressure. However, price action shows resistance near $0.80. On the 4-hour chart, ADA has slipped slightly, with MACD showing a weakening bullish signal and the Balance of Power turning negative. This reflects fading bullish strength in the short term. A sustained hold above $0.737 may preserve upside potential, while a drop below risks a correction. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability. Cardano price prediction May 2025 By May 2025, Cardano is projected to have a minimum price of $0.6638, with forecasts showing a maximum price of $0.7468 and an average price of $0.7260.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.264 Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030.

2025-05-18T11:45:44.000Z,"‘Epidemic of Scams’ Flooding Instagram and Facebook Affecting Many Different Industries, Says Meta: Report","Meta executives are reportedly acknowledging a serious new problem with scams affecting its social media platforms. A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of social media behemoths Instagram and Facebook, tells the Wall Street Journal that the corporate giant is dealing with “an epidemic of scams” that has been growing exponentially in recent years, both in scale and sophistication. “As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts.” The spokesperson reveals that Meta is experimenting with facial-recognition technology while also forming partnerships with banks and tech firms since the scams are affecting so many industries and “different parts of society.” Citing people familiar with the matter, WSJ also reports that JPMorgan Chase has raised concerns with Meta about its policing – or lack thereof – of scams. Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase customers between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a WSJ source. JPMorgan also recently began blocking certain Zelle payments and warning users about transactions originating from social media platforms like Meta. The person said that the number of scams linked to Meta has shown improvement in recent months. However, documents seen by WSJ reportedly show that Meta has recently deprioritized enforcing scams, avoiding takedowns of erroneous advertisements because of supposed safety concerns, while also cutting costs and moving resources to other departments. WSJ interviewed Edgar Guzman, the owner of a home improvement supplies and garden equipment company in Atlanta, who said scams are relentlessly targeting his customers, prompting them to make payments for products that never arrive. Says Guzman, “What sucks is we have to break it to people that they’ve been scammed – we don’t even do online sales… We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-18T11:32:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Dominance Dives in May as Altcoins Form Golden Cross","It’s a sign of a bullish market for all crypto assets that are not called BTC. Last time this happened in 2021, a bevy of popular altcoins returned cryptocurrency buyers 28,000% by the end of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Takes 4% Spill Bitcoin’s market share fell from 65% to 61% between May 7 and May 13, according to TradingView. Markets haven’t seen that 65% level of BTC dominance over altcoins since 2021. That year was the altseason, as crypto veterans like to call it, that launched Dogecoin’s price tens of thousands of percent upward in under 12 months. Meanwhile, in 2021, a $100 Shiba Inu investment went from Jan. 1, 2021, to over $14 million by Mar. 2023. Two unemployed Millennial brothers from Westchester, NY, invested $8,000 in Shiba Inu that year after a family friend told them about it. There are hundreds of trillions of dollars out there. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin . Do the math. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 8, 2025 As Bitcoin boosters like to say: Do the math. While a 4% dip in Bitcoin dominance may seem like a small fraction, the numerator here is a global Internet currency with a two trillion dollar market cap on May 7. That’s something like an $80 billion dip in market share against altcoins over six days in May. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price and market cap grew by 7% during those six days, even as its wedge on the pie chart shrank. Altcoins Form Bullish Golden Cross Meanwhile, an index of altcoin prices formed a golden cross in May, potentially signaling bullish momentum into a prolonged bull run. As one popular crypto YouTube analyst reported on May 13, the total altcoin market cap for major currencies has formed a golden cross. That’s when a shorter-term moving average crosses from below to above a longer-term moving average. Altseason incoming. golden cross hit. Last time this happened in 2021, alts went +28,000% 2025 just did the same. if you fumble this run, you deserve to stay broke.

Traders use that to get a sense of the market’s inertia. If the last market cycle’s performance repeats on this round, the total altcoin market cap could exceed $5 trillion sometime by 2026.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.

This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.Bitfinex BTC margin longs, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitfinex margin longs dropped to 65,889 BTC from 80,387 BTC between April 16 and May 16. This shift marks a reversal from the strong bullish margin demand seen between mid-February and mid-March, a period when Bitcoin’s price fell to $82,500 from $97,600. The current decrease in margin longs is likely a sign of healthy profit-taking rather than a turn toward bearish momentum.The reasoning behind this move is not entirely clear, since Bitcoin’s jump above $100,000 occurred on May 8, about three weeks after the margin longs peaked. Still, it would be wrong to suggest that Bitfinex whales have adopted a bearish outlook. Their margin longs now total $6.8 billion, while margin shorts stand at just $25 million, showing a major gap between bullish and bearish positions.Bitfinex BTC margin shorts, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThis difference is mainly due to Bitfinex’s low 0.7% annual interest rate for margin trading. By contrast, those using leverage for 90-day Bitcoin futures are paying a 6.3% annualized premium. This gap creates arbitrage opportunities.For example, one can open Bitcoin longs on margin and simultaneously sell an equivalent position in BTC futures to benefit from the rate difference. Margin traders also tend to have longer time frames and higher risk tolerance than average investors, so their position changes are less affected by short-term price moves.Whales unfazed by $105,000 resistance as BTC ETFs drive optimismTo rule out factors limited to margin markets, it is useful to look at Bitcoin options.

2025-05-16T19:14:46.000Z,"Bitfinex Bitcoin longs total $6.8B while shorts stand at $25M — Time for BTC to rally?","Key takeaways:Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.Bitfinex BTC margin longs, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitfinex margin longs dropped from 80,387 BTC to 65,889 BTC between April 16 and May 16. This shift marks a reversal from the strong bullish margin demand seen between mid-February and mid-March, a period when Bitcoin’s price fell from $97,600 to $82,500. The current decrease in margin longs is likely a sign of healthy profit-taking rather than a turn toward bearish momentum.The reasoning behind this move is not entirely clear, since Bitcoin’s jump above $100,000 occurred on May 8, about three weeks after the margin longs peaked. Still, it would be wrong to suggest that Bitfinex whales have adopted a bearish outlook. Their margin longs now total $6.8 billion, while margin shorts stand at just $25 million, showing a major gap between bullish and bearish positions.Bitfinex BTC margin shorts, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThis difference is mainly due to Bitfinex’s low 0.7% annual interest rate for margin trading. By contrast, those using leverage for 90-day Bitcoin futures are paying a 6.3% annualized premium. This gap creates arbitrage opportunities.For example, one can open Bitcoin longs on margin and simultaneously sell an equivalent position in BTC futures to benefit from the rate difference. Margin traders also tend to have longer time frames and higher risk tolerance than average investors, so their position changes are less affected by short-term price moves.Whales unfazed by $105,000 resistance as BTC ETFs drive optimismTo rule out factors limited to margin markets, it is useful to look at Bitcoin options. If traders expect a correction, demand for put (sell) options rises, pushing the 25% delta skew above 6%.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($99,416) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone signal that bulls remain in control.

If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA.

A break below it could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($2,225).

2025-05-16T15:00:00.000Z,"From debanking to a banking arms race—The rise of stablecoins","Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin PayrollThere are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. It is imperative that the banking industry stop shunning crypto and start — at least understanding it — to stay competitive. How stablecoins are deployed will separate the banking winners and losers. From debanking to stablecoins Of course, stablecoins are not a new concept. For years, large institutions like JPMorgan and Santander have experimented with stablecoins and blockchains. Those experiments were around small functions like internal treasury reconciliation and interbank settlement. Much of this was also on private blockchains created by those banks. Implementing digital dollars on private chains, however, misses out on the core innovation of stablecoins.While the use case of stablecoins for international remittances is clear, we are just scratching the surface of the power of stablecoins on public networks. For example, stablecoins eradicate unauthorized payment disputes and enable far faster pay cycles. Payroll payments are also complex. Payday is a web of thousands of automated clearing houses, wires, comma-separated values and PDFs. The programmability of stablecoins enables companies to create efficiency among all these data structures, processing times, reconciliations and paycheck reporting. Many smaller banks are just now waking up to the opportunity to incorporate permissionless, public network stablecoins into their workflows. Similar to how many businesses started to investigate how AI might change their businesses with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, so too are banks needing to look at how stablecoins will upend money movement. Recently, Custodia Bank issued its own stablecoin, Avit, on Ethereum. Custodia’s users can access quick, cheap banking services that are hard to beat. This is an excellent example of implementation for other financial institutions to follow.Stablecoin adoption is increasing as the tech keeps improvingActive stablecoin wallets increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to over 30 million in February 2025, according to Artemis and Dune. US President Donald Trump hopes to have stablecoin legislation on his desk by August 2025. Wyoming already did so in late March 2025.Recent: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsStablecoin infrastructure has improved significantly, and there is increased confidence in the security of stablecoins. 91% of the supply of stablecoins is fiat-backed, and only 8.5% are backed by collateralized crypto assets. Riskier algorithmic stablecoins have gone out of vogue.Incremental changes also make it easier for non-crypto businesses to use stablecoins. There are now simple solutions for many of the original UX problems with stablecoins.Additionally, more assets are moving onchain. Using stablecoins on public networks like Ethereum, payment companies will be better prepared to serve the future financial system. It’s not just stablecoins that are updating the financial system, either. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Squawk Box he wants the SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks.”For banks looking for a competitive advantage in a world of powerful fintechs, shifting interest rates and lower consumer savings, using the power of stablecoins to improve their products and their internal operations might be the most powerful decision they make. Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin Payroll.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-16T14:30:00.000Z,"Europe’s MiCA law is motion, but can the crypto industry keep up?","The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines approaching, firms are being forced to act quickly.Stablecoins at bayOne of MiCA’s earliest and most controversial provisions involves stablecoins. Under the law, no stablecoin can be offered to EU users unless the issuer is authorized in the EU and publishes a regulator-approved white paper.Strict rules around asset reserves, governance, conflict of interest and marketing are also part of the package. Issuers are even banned from offering interest on tokens, removing a common incentive for adoption.Related: Stablecoin regulation next ‘catalyst’ for crypto industry — Aptos headThe world’s most-used stablecoin — Tether’s USDt (USDT) — has already announced it won’t seek MiCA compliance, meaning exchanges may soon be forced to delist it across the EU. This has major implications for liquidity, retail access and DeFi activity in the region.Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson at Token 2049:“The reason is not, uh, fear of regulations, fear of compliance… The problem that I had with um, with MiCA is that [the] license is very dangerous when it comes to stablecoins and I believe that it's even more dangerous for the small medium banking system in Europe.”Compliance is keyOn the flip side, other firms are leaning in. BitGo, a crypto custody firm, recently secured a MiCA-aligned license in Germany, positioning itself to serve institutional players across Europe. Brett Reeves, head of Go Network and European Sales at BitGo, told Cointelegraph the license is not just about compliance, but long-term strategic alignment with Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape.“We found that both BaFin and the European regulators have been relatively straightforward to deal with. Sometimes they have difficult questions, but they're there to make sure that our processes are in place and up to scratch.”We also spoke with Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, who emphasized the need for consistent national-level interpretation and better guidance from regulators to prevent fragmentation.Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-16T14:22:30.000Z,"Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors","As cryptocurrency gains in popularity and price, some criminals are taking to violent measures to steal funds from high-profile crypto holders.Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high-profile attacks this year.Ledger founder and wife kidnapped, freedThe founder of crypto wallet Ledger, David Balland, and his wife, Amandine Balland, were kidnapped from their home on Jan. 21. The couple was put in a car, then separated and held at different locations. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the kidnappers called an executive at Ledger and demanded a substantial ransom to be paid in cryptocurrencies. They reportedly mutilated Balland’s hand and sent Ledger a photograph to put pressure on the company.Some 230 officers participated in the search after Ledger alerted authorities. The police managed to locate and free David on Jan. 22 in Châteauroux, 30 miles southwest of his residence. One day later, after questioning arrested suspects and analyzing phone records, police were able to locate and rescue Amandine in Étampes, 80 miles north of Vierzon.A small portion of the ransom was paid. Beccuau said it was frozen and tracked, leading to the arrest of nine men and one woman. Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier released a statement after Balland was rescued. Source: Pascal GauthierLambo sale goes wrong for Korean Bitcoin traderOn Jan. 20, Korean Bitcoin (BTC) trader Taehwa Kim met with a man under the alias “JC” in Makati City, Philippines who was supposedly interested in buying his Lamborghini. After a test drive, they stopped at a spa, supposedly to meet with JC’s lawyer. Three other men forced Kim into another vehicle and bound his hands. Kim was kept for three days. Then, the attackers abandoned him some 50 kilometers away, his hands still tied, where police officers found him.The perpetrators didn’t manage to get his crypto, but they stole his car, his Rolex watch, his wallet and the keys to his house. Streamer shoots would-be crypto thievesIn November 2024, Kick streamer and cosplayer Kaitlyn Siragusa, known professionally as “Amouranth,” posted a screenshot on X of her crypto wallet. It held some $20 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Months later, on March 2, 2025, three armed assailants allegedly broke into her home with the intent of stealing her cryptocurrency. She posted during the incident on X, stating, “I’m being too robbed at gunpont. I believe I shot one of them they wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed.”Siragusa claimed that the assailants physically assaulted her before she discharged a weapon, after which they fled the scene. She said that police were testing blood left by suspects at the scene and posted video of the incident on her X profile. Kidnappers demand $50 million in crypto from Spanish businessmanOn March 29, police in São Paulo arrested a retired military police officer in connection with the week-long kidnapping of a Spanish businessman. Speaking to authorities, the businessman said he was approached by two men dressed in fake civil police uniforms and forced into a truck. Upon reaching a secluded location on the outskirts of the city, the assailants held him and demanded $50 million in cryptocurrency.Local media said the kidnappers drugged their victim with sleeping pills, but he was still able to escape when one of them went to the bathroom. After finding a filling station, he tipped off police, who seized one of the suspects as well as a pistol and ammunition. Daughter of crypto exchange owner fights off assailants The daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Paris when passersby intervened.Three masked attackers tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a van while they were taking a walk in Paris on May 13. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

The assailants fled in a van, which was later found abandoned nearby. The victims sustained injuries and were evacuated to a local hospital. Local media reported that the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior, was investigating the incident. Assailants target father of crypto entrepreneurKidnappers in Paris, France abducted the father of a French cryptocurrency entrepreneur on May 4. The attackers took him to Essonne, 35 miles away from the Paris street where they grabbed him, and cut off his finger. They made a video and sent it to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. The victim’s son subsequently contacted police. The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Authorities have noted the striking similarities of the case to that of Balland, whose attackers also took him several miles from the city and mutilated his hand. “Obviously, there’s at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it’s the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde.Authorities seek answers and crypto holders want securityThe rise in recent attacks has shaken the crypto industry. Ben Davis, co-founder and CEO at blockchain insurance firm Native, told Cointelegraph, “We used to see crypto wrench attacks predominantly happening when executives were abroad or traveling. However, high-profile cases like the kidnapping of Ledger’s co-founder show that attackers are now targeting individuals in their own homes, with more planning and precision than ever before.”Authorities are responding to concerns as well. On May 16, the French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with cryptocurrency professionals to address the recent uptick in violent crime against industry figures. For the foreseeable future, personal security, not just asset security, will be a defining theme of the crypto industry. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky WeeAdditional reporting by Cath Jenkin",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-16T13:55:35.000Z,"The emergence of Sonic and what it means for DeFi: Report","Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.  Download a full version of the report for free hereSonic’s technical architectureSonic runs on the proprietary SonicVM execution engine, which dynamically translates EVM bytecode into a faster internal format for speedier execution. It also optimizes heavy computations to prevent repeated work and pre-analyzes contract code to cache valid jump destinations. The SonicVM is fully compatible with the EVM, meaning that Fantom smart contracts can run seamlessly on the new blockchain.To address the issue of hefty onchain data storage and slow node synchronization, Sonic uses a new database design called SonicDB. SonicDB separates the blockchain state into two databases. It uses the LiveDB for fast access to the current state and execution, and the ArchiveDB for storing full historical data. This separation allows consensus nodes to cut data storage requirements by up to 90% and thus significantly reduces hardware requirements and synchronization time.For a more comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of Sonic, download the full report for free here. Introducing the S tokenThe Sonic mainnet is powered by a new native token, S. Holders of FTM can convert their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio using the official portal. S remains non-inflationary over the first six months following the mainnet launch in December 2024. Then, 6% of the initial supply will be minted to reward the early users of the blockchain. The full report offers in-depth coverage of several capital-efficient airdrop farming strategies with different risk profiles. Sonic rewards developers as well via its Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) mechanism. Up to 90% of the transaction fees across participating applications are forwarded to developers, while the rest is routed to validators.Becoming a new hub for DeFiAndre Cronje, one of the founders of Fantom and the mastermind behind the Yearn.finance protocol is spearheading DeFi innovation on Sonic. Cronje unveiled Flying Tulip, a new DeFi platform that combines trading, liquidity pools and lending functionalities. The report discusses some innovations Flying Tulip brings to the Sonic blockchain.Flying Tulip is based on the same concept as Curve v2’s dynamic bonding curve. An AMM with a dynamic bonding curve adjusts its curvature based on how close the pool price is to an external price observed by an oracle. It also automatically concentrates the liquidity around the current price, simplifying liquidity management and enhancing capital efficiency. Flying Tulip introduces even faster equilibrium curve updates and narrower ranges alongside other improvements with a novel dynamic loan-to-value model.

2025-05-16T13:29:56.000Z,"51% attack on Ethereum more difficult than on Bitcoin — Justin Drake","Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that he believes it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and he expects a successful attack to be “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network’s mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:“This will become blindingly obvious over the next decade. ETH is the only truly decentralized crypto-asset that can become the internet's [store of value].“Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacksEthereum attack would cost much moreDrake explained that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:“A rich nation state can probably pull it off.“At the time of writing, there was 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.Staked Ether chart. Source: BeaconCha.inStill, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinEthereum’s last line of defenseMatan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.“Ethereum’s ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community’s powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.Drake also highlighted another advantage that he believes Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” “This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.Drake’s statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network’s human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin’s simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-proponent-claims-bitcoin-is-screwed-a-51-attack-likely?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline.XRP appears to be on such a trajectory, and bulls need to flip $2.60 back into support in order to increase the chances of the price rising to $3.00. Higher than that, the next logical move would be the neckline at $3.40 to complete the V-shaped pattern. This would represent a 40% increase from the current price.XRP/USD daily chart.
