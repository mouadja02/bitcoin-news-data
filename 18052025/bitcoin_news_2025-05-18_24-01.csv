2025-05-18T21:30:55.000Z,"Paraguay Police Busts Crypto Mining Theft Near Itaipu Dam","Paraguayan police have stopped an attempted theft at a crypto mining site near the Itaipu hydroelectric dam. The operation led to one arrest and the deportation of three foreign nationals. This event, still under investigation, has raised new concerns about security in areas rich in energy and crypto activity. Attempted Break-In at Teratech Mining Site Four individuals reportedly broke into a restricted area of Teratech SA’s crypto mining site in Coronel Bogado on May 15. Local police acted fast and stopped the suspects before they could run away. Prosecutor Irene Rolón, who is in charge of the case, confirmed that the event happened and that the investigation is still ongoing. Three of the suspects are Chinese nationals: Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun, and Zheng Guanglong. Authorities found no official records of their entry into Paraguay. Investigators believe they may have entered illegally through Brazil or Bolivia. All three have now been deported. The fourth suspect, Nahun María Velázquez Garcete, is a Paraguayan citizen. He was seriously injured and hospitalized before being placed in pretrial detention. He is facing charges of aggravated theft. Authorities believe the group may have previously worked as independent contractors at Teratech. However, this has not been confirmed. Prosecutors are waiting for a statement from Teratech’s CEO. The undocumented individuals claimed to be programmers and may have been in the area for months. However, their connections to the crypto facility are still unclear. The investigation is still open, and officials suspect more people could be involved. More Crypto Mining Now Uses Clean Energy The Itaipu dam is one of the biggest hydroelectric plants in the world. It offers cheap electricity, which makes Paraguay a good place for crypto mining. However, this recent incident shows that important places like this need better security. At the same time, the Bitcoin mining industry is changing. A study from Cambridge University shows that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now uses clean energy, higher than 37.6% in 2022. 42.6% of the clean energy comes from wind and water, while another 9.8% comes from nuclear power. Natural gas is now the top source of energy for Bitcoin mining , rising from 25% in 2022 to 38.2%. In 2021, US Senator Ted Cruz shared that mining Bitcoin with natural gas could be an avenue to generate In comparison, Coal use has decreased, from 36.6% in 2022 to just 8.9% now. The U.S. Leads the Way in Crypto Mining When China banned crypto mining in 2021, the U.S. became the dominant force in the sector. A January report shows that the country controls over 40% of the global hashrate . The election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump has also raised hopes for the industry. However, events like Paraguay show that good rules and strong security are needed as crypto mining keeps growing.

2025-05-18T21:00:00.000Z,"Will Ruvi AI (RUVI) Beat Cardano’s (ADA) Multichain Breakthrough? Analysts Expect 20,000% Potential Thanks to AI Technology","Cardano (ADA) is making headlines again and currently priced at $0.73 . With its Lace wallet’s cross-chain integration with Bitcoin , the stage is set for unprecedented interoperability. Analysts think ADA could hit $1 soon with its focus on innovation and use cases. But another rising star is gaining attention in the crypto space – Ruvi . Combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi is going to change the game for cryptocurrency and many are wondering if it will surpass Cardano’s success. Cardano’s Big Innovations Cardano’s recent updates show it’s committed to being a leader in blockchain. Here are the highlights: Lace Wallet Integration with Bitcoin Input Output Global’s ADA-based Lace wallet now supports Bitcoin. Users can hold and transact both BTC and ADA within the same ecosystem. Cardano is a multichain player. Interoperability Integrating blockchain networks and simplifying multichain portfolio management opens up new possibilities for Cardano. Its preparation for advanced cross-chain features like staking and DeFi shows it’s thinking ahead. Price and Sentiment ADA recently hit $0.86 and is now at $0.77. Analysts think breaking resistance could take it to $1 and solidify its position as a Layer-1 blockchain. While Cardano is building out blockchain infrastructure, Ruvi is combining AI with cryptocurrency , offering something new to investors. Ruvi’s Vision Ruvi doesn’t just compete; it disrupts. By combining blockchain with AI, Ruvi is changing industries and challenging traditional cryptocurrency limits. Why Ruvi AI Features Ruvi uses AI for predictive analytics, decision-making and solving problems in healthcare, logistics and finance. This adds a practical layer to its blockchain. Deflationary Model With a capped supply of 5 billion tokens , Ruvi creates scarcity and long term price appreciation.3. Real-World Use Cases Ruvi isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a tool for innovation in data analytics and problem-solving, so it’s relevant across multiple industries. While Cardano builds bridges in blockchain, Ruvi builds bridges between blockchain and AI, taking cryptocurrency innovation to the next level. Ruvi’s Presale Record Ruvi has already proven itself in its ongoing presale. During phase 1 , Ruvi sold over 100 million tokens and raised $1 million with over 1,000 investors . With phase 2 now live, early adoption incentives make Ruvi one of the hottest opportunities in the crypto space. Tokens are priced at just $0.015 and the bonus structure makes it even more attractive. Investment Breakdown Here’s an example of your returns when investing in Ruvi during presale: Entry-Level Investment ($600) Tokens at $0.015 = 40,000 Bonus (20%) = 8,000 Total Tokens = 48,000 Value at $1 = $48,000 Mid-Level Investment ($2,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 133,333 Bonus (60%) = 80,000 Total Tokens = 213,333 Value at $2 = $426,666 High-Level Investment ($12,000) Tokens at $0.015 = 800,000 Bonus (100%) = 800,000 Total Tokens = 1.6 million Value at $3 = $4.8 million With these kind of returns, Ruvi could match or beat the returns of previous blockchain success stories like Cardano. Ruvi vs Cardano While Cardano is building a multichain platform, Ruvi’s core value is in combining AI with blockchain innovation. Cardano is doing great work but Ruvi offers a unique value proposition by solving real world problems and delivering AI solutions. Why Now Cardano is great and has price potential but Ruvi is a once in a lifetime opportunity for exponential returns. The presale pricing creates a sense of urgency for early investors to get in before widespread adoption drives up demand and prices.

2025-05-18T20:47:57.000Z,"XRP Primed for Epic $9 Price Explosion As Institutional Money Floods Back Heavily","A digital asset trader has triggered wider bull sentiments after marking a potential breakout in XRP price. The crypto market is on a recovery path as macro sentiments build up amid weakened trade tensions. With billions flowing into the space, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could be set for a new price uptick. XRP Traders Build Momentum Expert trader Ali Martinez highlighted the chances of XRP moving past $2.70 as the wider market flips green. The asset has recorded significant growth after breaking the $2 level. At press time, XRP trades at $2.36, a 9% rally in the last 24 hours, doubling down on last week’s gains. The XRP price forms an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating sustained growth. According to Martinez, the current stretch favors a breakout to the psychological level of $2.70. If the asset beats this mark, it could trigger wider inflows from retail and institutional investors, setting the pace for the $9 milestone. This year, the institutional favorite nosedived from multi-year highs after it flipped Tether as the third-largest crypto asset by market cap. While institutional traders offloaded assets, the sell-off from retail holders summed up the general market sentiment. Growing macro tensions due to the United States’ trade wars jolted markets, leading to a bearish pattern. However, cooling tensions have ushered in stronger trading metrics and optimism. President Trump’s tariff suspension in the last two weeks led to a bullish swing as institutional adoption soared. Bitcoin price now stands above $100k, while altcoins recovered lost ground. CoinShares Weekly Fund Flow report shows the total market ended consecutive seven-day outflows to record gains. XRP led altcoin gains with $37.7 million in its products, stretching monthly figures. Teucrium CEO Backs XRP Amid growing XRP adoption, Teucrium CEO praised the asset’s utility compared to others. In a recent Bloomberg interview, he stated that XRP has the most utility among crypto assets, adding that Bitcoin is a store of value, but XRP has a true use case. Recently, the company rolled out a 2X Leverages XRP ETF , which targets short-term traders projecting daily price movements. “We chose XRP because we believe it’s the coin with the most utility. It’s not just speculation; it facilitates real transactions. Ripple is a team of true professionals.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-epic-9-price-explosion-as-institutional-money-floods-back-heavily/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-18T20:35:28.000Z,"Why Did the Rally in Ethereum Stop? Expert Analyst Predicts the Future of Bitcoin and ETH in the Coming Days","Coinbase Institutional’s head of research David Duong noted that the recent rally in Ethereum (ETH) is based on technical factors, but investor appetite for capital allocation is still limited. “The rise of ETH last week was largely due to technical reasons. This was related to the excess of mismatched positions, short closings, and then reopening of positions. This bullish wave is actually ETH catching up with its peers like BTC and SOL,” Duong said on social media. Duong said that this recovery in ETH price does not imply a general appetite for capital allocation in the market: “Such price movements do not mean that the market is willing to allocate ETH on a large scale; demand is still limited.” Related News: Will the Next Move in Bitcoin Prices Lead to a Record or Is a Correction on the Way? Analyst Outlines Two Price Scenarios On the other hand, Duong also drew a positive picture in his comments about Bitcoin (BTC): “BTC is on the rise and its dominance can still increase.” In terms of the macroeconomic outlook, Duong said that the softening in trade relations between the US and China has increased investor sentiment in the last week. In particular, Duong stated that the US’s $600 billion trade agreement with Saudi Arabia has reinforced this optimism, and that this has pushed back expectations of a recession in the US this year. But things are more complicated on the Japanese side, Duong said, with the country's upper house elections in July likely to harden Tokyo's stance, despite earlier statements calling for a trade deal by June. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-18T20:30:49.000Z,"Tariffs will push people deeper into digital worlds, says Animoca co-founder","With the wrapping up of TOKEN2049 Dubai, one thing was clear that Web3’s next chapter is imminent. In an interview with Cryptopolitan, Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu laid out how digital property rights, AI agents, and decentralized identities will shape the internet’s future and why the next crypto cycle is about more than just price action. If you think Animoca Brands is just a gaming company or a venture capital firm, you’re not thinking big enough. According to Yat Siu, Animoca’s true identity is as an ecosystem builder, one on a mission to make digital property rights a global standard. “Basically, if you think of us as an ecosystem builder, our mission is to make digital property rights standard in the world,” Siu explains. “We do this through gaming. We also do some investments. But if you want to make the whole world accept digital property, you can’t do it alone.” Animoca bets on gaming tokens revival Since its entrance into the blockchain space in 2017, Animoca has deployed capital into over 570 projects, with more than 165 of those directly tied to gaming. When asked why Animoca has invested so broadly, from games to infrastructure, Siu emphasized that the company is not a traditional VC. “All of our investments come from our balance sheet. We don’t run a fund. It’s more like how Apple should be operating,” he explained. “Apple has $300 billion in cash. Do they have a VC fund? No. Should they? Yes, If they put even 1% of that into building apps for the App Store, they would build a bigger ecosystem.” What was the spark that ignited Animoca’s Web3 gaming ambitions? We asked. He highlighted that it was CryptoKitties, the collectible cat NFTs that first hinted at a programmable, ownable internet in 2017. Siu compares it to the early mobile gaming boom. “It wasn’t really a game. It was NFTs you could breed. Was it a great game? No. But it was the moment we understood this was big.” Even after hundreds of investments, not everything has gone smoothly. Siu acknowledges some missteps, especially during crypto bear markets. Token launches—such as Gunzilla’s Off The Grid and other projects—underwhelmed, often because of macro conditions rather than product quality. “Gaming macro was bad. All gaming tokens were doing badly,” Siu notes. Still, he remains optimistic. He believes gaming and metaverse tokens like SAND (from Animoca-backed The Sandbox) are primed for a strong comeback by the end of the year, driven by renewed mainstream attention thanks to events like GTA VI’s release and new Nintendo hardware. “We believe existing gaming projects that are already listed have an opportunity because they’re underpriced. They’re currently priced relative to utility, not sentiment.” Mocaverse is Animoca’s next big play As bullish as he is on gaming, Siu is placing major bets on two less-hyped areas: digital identity and education. He sees digital identity, specifically Animoca’s Mocaverse project as crucial to building a robust, reputation-based Web3 economy. “Digital identity with multiples is a huge bet we’re taking. We think it’ll create a mass market in terms of digital reputation and make a huge impact.” He also sees education as fertile ground for Web3 applications, though details on Animoca’s approach remain under wraps. Meanwhile, the rise of AI has only strengthened his thesis. Far from a threat, Siu sees AI as a catalyst for Web3 mass adoption. “Your wallet won’t be MetaMask. It’ll be an AI agent that does MetaMask for you, the kind of wallet I can give my grandma,” he says. AI will also unlock explosive growth in user-generated content, composable NFTs, and autonomous agents transacting in crypto. “The native currency of AI agents is crypto. It’s nothing else.” Despite all the futuristic visions, Siu remains grounded in gaming culture. A self-professed first-person shooter fan, he acknowledges the massive appeal of hyper-casual and idle games but doesn’t view them as competition in the traditional sense. “The competitor of idle games isn’t other games, it’s TikTok. It’s all about attention,” he said. For Siu, the magic of gaming lies in its cultural universality, whether it’s Prince of Persia sparking curiosity about Persia or modern Chinese games finding global audiences. “Gaming is culture. You have to hit something that fits into the cultural narrative.” Tariffs won’t stop gaming, they’re borderless Turning to geopolitics, when asked about the impact of rising US-China tariffs and trade tensions, Siu offered a surprising take. “Tariffs are positive for digital industries. If people can’t buy goods as easily, they turn to entertainment and games, and remember, there’s no tariff on software or Bitcoin,” he noted. As physical goods become pricier, Siu expects people to spend more time in digital spaces, where tariffs don’t apply. “Games are neutral, I can play Fortnite, The Sandbox, or Axie Infinity without worrying about tariffs,” he said. Even when it comes to crypto, the borderless nature of digital assets stands out. “If I send you Bitcoin from China, there’s no tariff on that,” Siu added. Wrapping up the conversation, I asked Yat Siu whether he believes most gaming-related tokens are fundamentally overvalued. His response was clear: “No, I think they’re fundamentally undervalued.” Siu explained that gaming tokens reflect much more than just current speculation, they mirror the broader macro trends within the digital economy. “If we believe, as we do, that gaming’s role in the global economy will grow by the end of the year, then these tokens are undervalued,” he said confidently.

2025-05-18T20:30:01.000Z,"Bitcoin Billionaires Missed SHIBAINU and TRUMP — Now They’re All In on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum","Introduction Some of the wealthiest early Bitcoin holders watched from the sidelines as SHIBA INU and TRUMP tokens exploded with 100x–1000x gains. But in 2025, those same wallets are rotating into four strategic altcoins they believe are next in line for exponential growth : MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Ethereum, and Injective (INJ). With MAGACOIN FINANCE nearing Stage 9 , and Ethereum preparing for major ETF momentum, this isn’t just another altcoin rally — it’s a coordinated repositioning by smart capital ahead of what could be the largest altcoin breakout in years . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the New Political Power Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of the early-stage narrative for one reason: it’s the last major presale with real structure before listings begin . While others chase overpriced tokens, early investors are positioning into MAGA — where the listing target of $0.007 and current Stage 8 entry point create a clear 25x–35x upside model . What’s attracting major crypto whales: Transparent tokenomics with time-sensitive phases Political branding that connects with a specific audience segment No fluff — just a capped supply and a strong runway With major listing events on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer under the radar — it’s the entry that Bitcoin billionaires don’t want to miss twice. XRP’s Institutional Pivot Gets Real XRP is trading near $2.30 , but the next move may be the biggest one yet. With CME futures listings imminent and payment use cases expanding globally, XRP is now seen as the liquidity infrastructure layer for institutional finance . Major investors who missed XRP’s first cycle are now coming back in — and pairing their exposure with early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with explosive growth . Price models continue to show $10–$30 targets , and with ETF speculation swirling, XRP remains a macro-level altcoin for serious portfolios. Ethereum Leads Smart Contract Capital Flows Ethereum (ETH) remains the top institutional Layer-1 , and its recent $2,600 support zone is proving strong as ETF attention builds. What’s making Ethereum a buy for long-term holders in 2025: Network upgrades that boost throughput (Pectra) Dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and L2 infrastructure Imminent ETF approval expectations But ETH is more than a safe hold — it’s the platform that supports a full altcoin ecosystem. For that reason, whales are using it alongside entries into high-upside tokens like MAGA , creating dual-layer portfolios for both growth and security. Injective (INJ) Rises as a DeFi Infrastructure Play Injective (INJ) has emerged as one of the strongest DeFi platforms of 2025. While often overlooked, INJ has shown consistent performance due to its focus on derivatives, orderbooks, and cross-chain protocol development. Currently trading near the top of its yearly range, INJ remains a high-conviction mid-cap for those seeking real use cases and long-term viability. However, even large holders of INJ are now diversifying into lower-cap pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE — where asymmetric upside remains unmatched. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin whales may have missed SHIBA and TRUMP , but they’re not making the same mistake twice. With MAGACOIN FINANCE closing out Stage 8, and XRP, ETH, and INJ gaining real traction, the capital is flowing into four strategic assets that combine legacy strength with next-phase upside . Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only project still offering true early-stage exposure — and smart money is already in motion.

On May 16, Mizrachi posted an apparently enigmatic “Bitcoin Reserve” message on X (formerly Twitter), following a meeting with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert — strategic advisers to El Salvador’s Bitcoin policies. While no official details were revealed, the timing of the post — just before Mizrachi’s scheduled appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas — suggests a potential policy reveal may be imminent. Panama City Eyes Bitcoin, Stablecoin Payments Mayor Mizrachi has already indicated he would be open to receiving municipal fees in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and USDC. He indicated, however, that this would need to proceed only when crypto-to-fiat payment infrastructure is online. A complete Bitcoin reserve, à la El Salvador’s, would require legislative protection from Panama’s National Assembly — which Mizrachi has not yet pursued. Learning from El Salvador’s Model Max Keiser, senior advisor to President Nayib Bukele, said their conversation involved Bitcoin mining and financial education. He added Panama’s hydroelectricity and El Salvador’s geothermal energy as Central American assets to further expand Bitcoin use in the region. Stacy Herbert, head of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, revealed Panama City plans to incorporate the “What is Money?” Bitcoin literacy textbook — a key part of El Salvador’s national curriculum — into its online library. Bitcoin Reserve Trend Increases Across the Globe Panama’s potential move is echoed by events in U.S. states like Arizona and New Hampshire, whose legislatures voted to support Bitcoin reserves. Ukraine has also reportedly been eyeing Bitcoin for national reserves. El Salvador currently holds over 6,100 BTC — worth nearly $640 million — as part of its official reserve, a path that Panama City may also want to take. Public Companies Build Up Bitcoin Stockpiles Institutional Bitcoin adoption continues to increase. Strategy, whose CEO Michael Saylor is a firm Bitcoin supporter, said that it will double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion to buy more BTC. This includes the offering of another $21 billion of common stock and raising its target debt issuance to $42 billion. Japan’s Metaplanet also joined the trend, buying 1,241 BTC at $126 million, bringing its holdings to 6,796 BTC — valued at over $706 million.

Strategy Could Soon Join S&P 500 Walton wrote in a post on the X app: Q2 is likely going to be the big blow out quarter on Earnings for $MSTR The quarter ends on 6/30 (52 days from now) The earnings release call will likely be on August 5th / 6th Technically Qualifying $MSTR for the S&P500 The market will react surprised & bewildered… — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 9, 2025 The S&P 500 is the US stock market benchmark comprised of the 500 largest companies in the United States by total market capitalization. Strategy’s entry onto the index would likely cause its share prices to soar. That’s what happened this week after markets slated Coinbase , the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, to join the S&P 500 with a market cap north of $67 billion. Did Michael Saylor lead the Company to Join Coinbase? Coinbase will enter the broad stock benchmark because Capital One Financial will acquire Discover Financial Services, bumping it off the stock exchanges. After that headline broke, COIN shares flew from under $200 to $266 to close the week. That was an easy 33% gain for shareholders like Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood. The investing maven is very bullish on crypto assets and Coinbase stocks. COIN is the third-largest holding in the ARKK ETF. Walton says Strategy could deliver a similar performance in August if it makes it onto the index. The Bitcoin treasury company guarantees returns on BTC investments to its clients with fixed return corporate bonds that retain the option to convert these notes into Strategy stocks.

2025-05-18T20:00:56.000Z,"$22,000,000,000,000 Market Cap in Store for Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto, According to Billionaire Mike Novogratz","Galaxy Digital chief executive Mike Novogratz believes the market cap of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto will eventually catch up to the valuation of one soaring asset. In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire says that crypto’s correction earlier this year is largely due to an overexuberant investor sentiment along with the launch of speculative assets, including the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin. But Novogratz notes that the markets needed the correction to cool off and set the stage for Bitcoin and crypto to surge to new all-time highs. “ We had a euphoric top right around [Trump’s] inauguration and a combination of a lot of things: Trump coin and whatnot… Crypto went back and tested where the [US presidential] election breakout was. Now it looks like we’ll take out $106,000, $107,000, $108,000 and make the next to $130,000, $150,000.” Zooming out, Novogratz believes that Bitcoin and crypto will witness a massive surge in market cap over time and rival gold’s current valuation of about $22 trillion. “And at that point, you’re at price discovery. I keep thinking that gold is a $22 trillion asset and crypto is a $2 trillion asset. And at one point, as more and more young people inherit the money from old people who kiss the face of god, you’re going to see crypto equal gold and that’s a long way from here.” Last year, the billionaire said the millennials, who stand to inherit the largest transfer of wealth in history, are more inclined to invest in digital assets than their boomer parents or relatives. The great wealth transfer will hand $90 trillion in assets to millennials over the next 20 years, according to the global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank’s 2024 Wealth Report.

2025-05-18T20:00:14.000Z,"Lab-Grown Gold Shakes Market as Bitcoin Rises as the New Safe Haven","Scientists at CERN have turned lead into gold using advanced technology. Although this is not ready for public use, the experiment is already raising serious concerns in the global financial markets. CNBC crypto trader Ran Neuner says this will hurt gold’s value as the world’s go-to safe-haven asset and push more people toward Bitcoin (BTC), causing the flagship cryptocurrency’s value to rise. Lab-Grown Gold Raises Alarm Over Scarcity Last week, researchers at CERN used the Large Hadron Collider to remove protons from lead atoms, turning them into gold. Although this method is still expensive and slow, it shows that the precious metal can now be made in a lab. In a recent X post , Ran Neuner quickly responded to the news. He warned that gold may no longer be seen as rare, which could make the precious metal no longer scarce. His view draws from the recent history of diamonds. After lab-grown diamonds entered the market, prices dropped as supply increased. Neuner believes gold may follow the same path if lab-made alternatives become common. Bitcoin Seen as the New Store of Value Neuner argued that this shift will push more people toward Bitcoin. Unlike gold, the digital asset cannot be created in a lab or printed at will. Its fixed supply of over 21 million coins adds to its appeal as a scarce asset. He emphasized that once people realize this, there will be a massive shift into crypto assets. Bitcoin’s strong performance over the past months supports this idea. The digital asset has shown resilience as gold prices rise and fall with global events like the U.S.–China tariff wars . Even though gold value rebounded by 10% after trade talks improved, Bitcoin still holds strong above $103,000, maintaining bullish momentum. Notably, analysts recently said the asset is in its Acceleration phase. Meanwhile, not everyone agrees with Neuner. Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, dismissed the comparison, saying Bitcoin is not a store of value like gold. However, the market seems to be leaning in Bitcoin’s favor. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, believes Bitcoin could hit $250,000 in this market cycle because of global financial problems. Other industry leaders, like Arthur Hayes and Samson Mow, predict that the Bitcoin price would climb to $1 million and match gold’s total value. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold as Inflation Hedge Beyond price, Bitcoin is now outperforming gold in investor interest. New data shows a steady shift of funds from gold into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This shows that investors now view Bitcoin as a more vigorous defense against inflation. With lab-grown gold on the horizon and Bitcoin gaining ground, the race for the ultimate safe haven is heating up. For now, Bitcoin is taking the lead.

2025-05-18T19:46:08.000Z,"Crypto millionaires are hiring bodyguards to avoid being kidnapped","Crypto millionaires are now treating personal security like they treat cold storage wallets – essential. A rising number of wealthy investors are hiring private protection teams, not because of price swings, but because people are literally trying to snatch them or their families off the street. The change began before Coinbase Global Inc. admitted hackers had stolen user addresses and balances, but that breach threw gasoline on a fire that was already burning. According to Bloomberg, Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International, said his firm has seen a steady rise in long-term contracts from clients with large crypto holdings. Jethro explained, “We’ve had more inquiries, more long-term clients, and more proactive requests from crypto investors who don’t want to be caught off guard.” His clients are now taking security just as seriously as their portfolios — armored vehicles, threat assessments, and total digital footprint scrubs are becoming routine. Hackers steal addresses, attackers knock on doors The Coinbase data breach has added a terrifying new layer to the risks. Hackers got hold of names, addresses, ID images, transaction logs, and even account balances — exactly the kind of data someone would need to target high-value individuals. Coinbase claimed less than 1% of active monthly users were affected, but those accounts stayed exposed for months. During that time, criminals used stolen information to manipulate users into handing over their wallets or transferring funds. Several affected users refused to speak publicly, citing safety concerns. Ronghui Gu, co-founder of CertiK and professor at Columbia University, told Bloomberg: “Crypto traders are acutely concerned about their privacy during data leaks. Cryptocurrency can be transferred with just a private key and is extremely difficult to recover. This makes crypto traders prime targets for criminals.” What’s worse is that this trend isn’t limited to cyberspace. Charles Marino, head of Sentinel — a security firm tracking crypto threats — said attackers are now focusing on physical crime because online defenses have improved so much. “Right now, the crypto threat landscape is very high,” he said. That’s not an exaggeration. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger SAS, was kidnapped alongside his partner. Balland was left with a mutilated hand. Just last week in Paris, criminals attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of the CEO of Paymium. The plan failed, but it shook the community. France’s Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, responded by announcing a special emergency police line for the crypto industry and promising elite unit support for security briefings and home protection assessments. Crypto firms spend big to protect their own It’s not just private holders taking action. Coinbase itself dropped $6.2 million last year to protect CEO Brian Armstrong. That’s more than JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nvidia spent combined on their top execs. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Source: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg And while Coinbase’s business might not match those giants in size, the danger is clearly more immediate. Robinhood spent $1.6 million to protect Vlad Tenev. Circle Internet Group put $800,000 into keeping Jeremy Allaire safe. Meta and Alphabet still outspend them all, but the contrast is striking — crypto companies are smaller, but the threats to their leaders are bigger. Security now includes everything from private drivers and 24-hour bodyguards to sweeping people’s social media for real-time location leaks. Infinite Risks International monitors posts to make sure clients aren’t dropping clues that could help would-be attackers. Jameson Lopp, a well-known Bitcoin security advocate, maintains a running database of physical attacks on crypto holders. He logged more than 20 incidents worldwide already this year. These cases aren’t just happening in France or the Netherlands. It’s global. Kidnappers, scammers, and gangs are watching wallets, tracking down names, and showing up at doors. Events are changing too. Organizers of EthCC, an annual crypto conference in Cannes, announced increased coordination with French police, special forces, and private contractors for this year’s edition. Last year, local police handled security. This year, it’s a full-blown operation. And traders are taking note. Many are now publicly saying they’re skipping trips to France entirely.

2025-05-18T19:33:08.000Z,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: How an 11-Year Solar Cycle May Be Driving the Charts","Dogecoin price prediction theories usually stick to charts and sentiment, but what if something cosmic is quietly pulling strings? A recent study suggests an 11-year solar cycle may align with crypto booms and busts, showing strong correlations between sunspot activity and market performance. As we enter the 6th year of this cycle in 2025 historically linked to cooling trends, some traders are watching closely. And while Dogecoin still has the spotlight, newer names like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining traction before the next major shift. Could this be the calm before the sun flares again? How the 11-Year Solar Cycle Could Impact Dogecoin in 2025 It sounds wild at first, solar flares affecting crypto prices? But there's growing data behind it. According to a study published on SSRN , there’s a noticeable correlation between the 11-year solar cycle and market trends, especially in Bitcoin. During the first half of the cycle (years 1–5), the market tends to rise. But in years 6 through 11, things shift and historically, that’s when slowdowns hit. 2025 marks year 6 of the current solar cycle, and if the pattern holds, we could see a dip or cooling-off period in risk assets, including Dogecoin. The study found a strong positive correlation during early cycle years and a moderate negative correlation as the cycle matures, suggesting optimism fades as solar activity passes its peak. While Dogecoin isn’t Bitcoin, meme coins often follow BTC’s lead during macro trends. If the sun’s activity really does influence investor sentiment (through biological or psychological effects, as the paper hints), DOGE might feel the pressure too. What the Data Says: Year 6 of the Solar Cycle and Market Slowdowns The idea that sunspot activity affects financial markets might sound far-fetched, but the data says otherwise. A study on Bitcoin and Solar Activity (2011–2024) found a clear pattern: crypto prices often rise in the first half of the 11-year solar cycle and slow down in the second half. Specifically, during years 1 to 5, Bitcoin showed strong gains, with a correlation coefficient of +0.71. But from years 6 to 11, that relationship flipped, with a moderate negative correlation of -0.48. Why does this matter now? Because 2025 marks Year 6 of the current solar cycle, and that’s historically when momentum fades. The data shows this mid-cycle period often brings market slowdowns, lower enthusiasm, and weaker price action across speculative assets. Since Dogecoin tends to move with Bitcoin during broader market shifts, it’s worth watching this timing closely. Technical vs Symbolic: Where Dogecoin’s 2025 Forecast Really Stands According to CoinCodex , Dogecoin’s 2025 forecast shows modest gains spread out over the year. The average price is expected to land around $0.140564, with monthly highs ranging from $0.1379 to $0.2143. The best potential return comes in December, with a projected 41.94% ROI, while May offers the lowest at just 0.08%. So far, the data doesn’t point to a massive breakout, but it also doesn’t signal a collapse. It’s a slow, cautious climb. While solar cycle theory suggests 2025 might cool down broader market sentiment, DOGE could still see short-term pops depending on retail interest and momentum. Dawgz AI and the Altcoin Underdogs Preparing for the Next Shift While Dogecoin holds its place as the OG meme coin, fresh contenders are quietly setting up for the next phase of the market cycle. Dawgz AI is one of those underdogs that’s not just chasing hype, it’s building ahead of the curve. At the time of writing, Dawgz AI has already raised over $3.59 million in its presale, with token prices set to increase soon. Early stakers can earn 120% APY, and the project’s been audited by SolidProof , giving it a layer of legitimacy that’s rare in meme coin circles. What sets Dawgz AI apart is its blend of meme branding and real AI-powered utility. Its trading bots run 24/7, and users can buy in with ETH, BNB, SOL, and USDT - making it as accessible as it is ambitious. Looking to learn more about $DAGZ? Check out the video below. Final Thoughts The latest Dogecoin price prediction shows steady but cautious growth through 2025, with some months offering stronger ROI than others. Add in the solar cycle theory, and things get even more interesting, especially as we enter a year historically linked to market slowdowns. Still, the story doesn’t end with DOGE. While it holds legacy status, altcoins like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining ground by mixing real tech with community-driven momentum. Frequently Asked Questions What will DOGE be worth in 2025? Dawgz AI might be gaining early traction, but Dogecoin is still holding attention for 2025. Most forecasts suggest DOGE could trade between $0.12 and $0.21, depending on market conditions and overall crypto sentiment. Will DOGE reach 1 dollar? While Dawgz AI is focusing on steady growth through utility, DOGE would need a massive rally to hit $1. Current projections don’t support that milestone anytime soon, it would take a major shift in market momentum. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? Compared to early-stage coins like Dawgz AI, DOGE is more established, trading around $0.14. That means $500 would currently get you about 3,570 DOGE, though prices fluctuate, so check the latest rate before buying. What will be the price of Dogecoin after 5 years? While Dawgz AI is betting on long-term growth through AI tools and staking, Dogecoin’s 5-year outlook is more uncertain. Some projections place DOGE between $0.30 and $0.70 by 2030, depending on adoption, use cases, and broader market trends.

2025-05-18T19:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Path to $500K: Why Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are the Top Watchlist Picks","Introduction As Bitcoin sets its sights on $500,000 , a growing number of analysts are calling this the most structured and capital-driven bull cycle in crypto history. But while Bitcoin remains the anchor, smart investors are also looking for the tokens best positioned to outperform BTC itself . That shortlist now includes Ethereum (ETH), XRP , and early-stage breakout candidate MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — each offering a different angle: infrastructure, payments, and high-momentum entry. Also catching attention is the TRUMP-themed altcoin trend, which reflects a broader shift toward narrative-driven investing. But only one token in this group still offers true pre-listing entry . Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Called the Final Major Entry of 2025 CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top watchlist pick among early-stage investors , especially as Stage 8 nears its final phase and exchange listings approach. With a locked listing price of $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something rare in this market: Clear structure and upside model Projected 25x–35x ROI range from current entry A politically charged brand that cuts through noise and fuels demand Unlike larger caps, MAGA still gives investors the chance to enter before major catalysts , and analysts are treating it as a ground-floor play that mirrors early DOGE or SHIBA entry mechanics — only this time, with tighter supply and price transparency. As Bitcoin lifts the entire market, capital continues rotating into MAGA as one of the only tokens offering 2021-style breakout potential in a mature 2025 landscape. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength and ETF Momentum Ethereum (ETH) has regained its strength as crypto’s technical foundation. With the recent Pectra upgrade complete and ETF speculation swirling, ETH is trading near $2,600 , with analysts targeting a breakout to $4,000–$6,000 in the coming months. What makes Ethereum a standout now is its infrastructure-level utility — powering nearly every major DeFi, NFT, and Layer-2 ecosystem. And with institutional access just a catalyst away, many believe ETH will run alongside BTC’s move to $500K, if not lead it at certain moments. For those balancing risk across different time horizons, Ethereum offers a layer of stability in a volatile market — while also serving as a capital springboard into more aggressive altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Maintains Its Role as Institutional Liquidity Leader XRP continues to hold above $2.30 , supported by legal clarity, increasing use in real-world payments , and the potential for CME futures integration. Now viewed by analysts as the infrastructure layer for digital liquidity , XRP is positioned to benefit as new financial rails are built globally. Short-term forecasts put XRP at $5–$15 , with longer-term price models placing it above $30 if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. As Bitcoin carves a path to $500K, XRP remains one of the only large caps with regulatory clarity and defined real-world utility — giving it continued credibility among both retail and institutional players. TRUMP-Themed Tokens Reflect the Political Shift in Crypto While not a traditional asset class, the rise of TRUMP-themed altcoins is notable. These coins are tapping into a massive base of politically motivated investors and retail traders looking for tokens that represent more than technology. Although speculative in nature, these tokens show that narrative and identity are becoming as powerful as fundamentals in driving altcoin demand. That said, not all politically themed coins are created equal. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE stand apart because they pair cultural narrative with a clear tokenomics structure and strategic rollout , giving them stronger staying power. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion Bitcoin’s road to $500K is setting the macro tone , but the real opportunities lie in where the capital flows next . Ethereum and XRP bring strength and scale, while politically charged trends continue to influence retail behavior. But among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only token currently offering true early-stage upside , a transparent growth path, and price levels that haven’t yet caught up with market potential. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this may be the final major entry point before MAGACOIN FINANCE joins the top tier of traded tokens .

2025-05-18T19:00:02.000Z,"Don’t Miss This! MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Booming as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Slow Down","Introduction Bitcoin is holding steady. Ethereum is consolidating. XRP has cooled off. But one altcoin is showing no signs of slowing — and smart investors are now zeroing in before the rest of the market catches up. MAGACOIN FINANCE , along with utility-focused projects like HBAR , is showing powerful momentum as May unfolds. With Stage 8 nearing completion , MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being called the only major token still in breakout mode . Here’s why the capital is shifting — and where it’s going next. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Booming as the Market Pauses CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST While larger tokens are stalling, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating. With a firm listing target of $0.007 and Stage 8 reaching critical demand , the project is now being viewed by analysts as a top-tier early-stage entry — especially for those seeking 25x–35x upside in the current cycle. What’s driving the shift: Structured tokenomics with limited entry windows High conviction positioning ahead of exchange listings A differentiated brand identity that stands out from typical meme or Layer-1 assets MAGACOIN FINANCE is booming not because of hype — but because its structure supports real capital rotation from slow-moving assets . As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP cool off, buyers are moving into opportunities with visible upward runway — and MAGA fits that criteria better than most. Bitcoin’s Slow Climb Sets the Market Tone Bitcoin (BTC) is still commanding the narrative — but its momentum has slowed. Trading in the $103K–$104K range, BTC is consolidating while ETF inflows stabilize. This is typical mid-cycle behavior. But during these quiet BTC phases, capital usually seeks faster-moving altcoins . As Bitcoin holds the base, early-stage entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE gain attention as shorter-term ROI vehicles . Bitcoin remains the macro anchor — but right now, the velocity is elsewhere. Ethereum Awaits Its Next Catalyst Ethereum (ETH) is locked in a waiting game. With price hovering near $2,600 , ETH is holding steady, but investor appetite is fading in the short term. The next big movement likely hinges on ETF approvals or another Layer-2 breakthrough. In the meantime, investors are rotating some ETH capital into early-stage coins with sharper growth potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing up in those rotations — especially for those seeking momentum during this holding phase. HBAR Shows Quiet Strength Amid the Shift While many large caps are cooling, Hedera (HBAR) has maintained a surprisingly bullish structure. Currently trading around $0.21 , HBAR recently posted a strong breakout from its earlier consolidation range. Its strength lies in enterprise partnerships and network reliability — and now, it’s being mentioned alongside MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few tokens that hasn’t lost momentum in May. HBAR may not move as aggressively, but it represents the utility-based, low-volatility pick complementing higher-risk plays like MAGA. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion The slowdown in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP isn’t bearish — it’s transitional. But while the majors pause, capital is moving — and it’s moving into high-upside early plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE and undervalued utility leaders like HBAR . With Stage 8 nearly complete and MAGA continuing to gain traction, this may be the last opportunity to get in before listings reshape the price range entirely . In a market where timing matters more than ever, the shift is clear — and the next move may already be underway.

Account holders accused the bank of purposefully blocking them from accessing higher interest rates in their savings accounts. Specifically, the bank is accused of misleading clients by not telling them about higher-yielding 360 Performance Savings accounts. This allegedly prevented customers from accessing better interest rates, keeping their 360 Savings account rates as low as 0.3%. The settlement, first reported by Reuters, will require a judge’s approval. It allocates $300 million to compensate depositors for interest they could have earned on 360 Performance Savings accounts, which offered rates up to 4.35% last year. The remaining $125 million will provide additional interest to depositors who currently hold 360 Savings accounts, addressing the lower rates they received. The agreement, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, covers customers with 360 Savings accounts since September 18, 2019. Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, did not admit wrongdoing and has not released a statement on the settlement at time of publishing.

2025-05-18T18:45:35.000Z,"Mastermind Behind SEC SIM Swapping Scheme Sentenced to 14 Months in Prison for Manipulating Bitcoin Price","The man who hacked an X account associated with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year has been sentenced to 14 months behind bars for manipulating the value of Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new press release , the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia says that Eric Council Jr. – a 26-year-old man from Alabama – has been sentenced to over a year in prison for his role in the exploit, when he and others hacked the X account of the regulator a means of boosting BTC. Authorities say that Council engaged in “SIM swaps,” or attacks on a mobile phone’s Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), which stores and authenticates unique user data and allows cellular devices to connect to mobile networks. Prosecutors say that on January 9th, 2024, Council and others SIM-swapped the cell phone of a person associated with the SEC’s official X account to make a fake post and manipulate the price of BTC. To pull off the scheme, Council created a fake ID card to trick AT&T store employees into giving him a replacement SIM card linked to the victim’s phone line. He then purchased a new iPhone, inserted the new SIM card and proceeded to reset the password of the SEC’s X account and shared the information with his co-conspirators before returning the phone for cash. One of the crew members subsequently made a fake post using the official SEC account about how the regulatory agency had approved BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which at the time were highly anticipated and pending approval. Following the post, BTC’s price rose by $1,000. However, after the SEC regained control of its account and confirmed that the post was fraudulent, BTC dipped by $2,000. As stated by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, “Schemes of this nature threaten the health and integrity of our market system. SIM swap schemes threaten the financial security of average citizens, financial institutions, and government agencies.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-18T18:10:23.000Z,"Expert Boldly Sets Timeline for XRP to Reach $9","The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to bold forecasts, but a recent projection involving XRP has intensified discussions among traders and analysts. As attention shifts toward altcoins amid shifting investor sentiment, The Modern Investor (@ModernInvest), a crypto enthusiast on X, has suggested that XRP could reach $9 by September 2025. The Modern Investor posed the scenario of an over 3x surge to challenge holders, asking if they would sell their tokens if the asset hits $9. While speculative, the remark quickly gained traction on X because of the bold prediction and the potential implications for token holders. XRP goes to 9$ in September. Are you selling ? — The Modern Investor (@ModernInvest) May 15, 2025 The asset is currently trading at $2.35. At $9, XRP’s market capitalization would be around $500 billion, rivaling the likes of Mastercard, Netflix, and many other valuable companies. Higher Targets for XRP Although the $9 figure is attention-grabbing, other analysts have gone further, basing their forecasts on market dominance and capital flow assumptions. DK64Trades (@DK64Trades), for example, has argued that XRP could surpass $10 in the current cycle . He pointed out that when XRP reached $3.84 during the 2018 bull market, it held more than 31% of the total cryptocurrency market share. In contrast, its dominance was just 5% when it reached a multi-year high of $3.39 in January. XRP’s dominance has shown notable resilience in 2025 , and if it can regain anything close to its previous dominance, the implications for its valuation are significant. Regaining its dominance would send XRP to $17.80 with a $1.04 trillion market cap within the current global crypto market cap of $3.33 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another prominent market voice, Capt Toblerone (@CaptToblerone), takes the analysis further. He envisions a total crypto market expansion to $35 trillion in the current cycle. If XRP were to capture $1.25 trillion of that, its price could climb to approximately $22. A shift in Bitcoin’s dominance could also aid XRP’s growth. Historical patterns show that falling Bitcoin dominance gives way for altcoins like XRP to grow significantly. The conversation has drawn in figures from outside the typical XRP circles as well. Davinci Jeremie, a long-time Bitcoin supporter, has stated that he sees a realistic path for XRP to reach $24 by the end of the year. Not all projections agree on urgency. Telegaon sees XRP hitting $9 by 2026 in very bullish conditions, and more likely by 2027. Changelly is even more conservative, expecting $9 by 2028. What unites all these perspectives is the assumption that XRP will eventually outpace its past performance. How soon that happens depends on multiple factors.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price was trading at $103,000 on Sunday, while the recent Ethereum ( ETH ) surge hit a barrier. Looking ahead, some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week will be Ripple ( XRP ), Trump Coin ( TRUMP ), and Zetachain ( ZETA ). XRP in focus ahead of CME futures launch XRP price will be spotlighted this week as CME Group launches the first cash-settled futures on Monday. Futures contracts let traders bet or hedge against the future price of an asset without holding it physically. The launch of XRP futures will be important as it will allow financial services companies to launch exchange-traded funds that track it. A good example is the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, which tracks the CME Bitcoin futures. The launch comes as the XRP price remains under pressure as it dropped from this month’s high of $2.65 to $2.4 today.

The unlock comes at a time when the Zetachain network is not doing well. The ZETA token price has crashed by 18% from its highest point this month, while the total value locked in its network has dropped to $26 million in January to $18 million. Pendle, Melania Meme Coin, Pyth Network, and Solana are other top crypto projects with scheduled unlocks this week.

2025-05-18T17:36:22.000Z,"Spot Markets Drive Bitcoin to $106K as Coinbase Sees $45M Daily Buying Pressure: Glassnode","Bitcoin’s surge to $106,000 earlier this week has been primarily driven by robust spot market demand, with Coinbase seeing net buying pressure of $45 million per day, according to Glassnode’s latest report. The rally, which began after the king cryptocurrency dipped to just below $75,000 in early April, has been marked by strong accumulation phases, exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and a cooling of sell-side pressure, pointing to sustained bullish momentum despite recent profit-taking by long-term holders. Spot Demand Outpaces Derivatives Unlike previous rallies fueled by leveraged speculation, this latest uptrend has been characterized by organic sport market accumulation. According to the Glassnode report , BTC changed hands heavily in the $93,000 to $95,000 range, which is now acting as a key support level as it coincides with the cost basis of traders who entered the market within the last 155 days. The price has respected this range amid sideways accumulation, reinforcing the “stair-stepping” structure visible on the Cost Basis Distribution heatmap. Meanwhile, derivatives markets lagged, with perpetual futures open interest dropping 10%, from 370,000 BTC to 336,000 BTC, possibly indicating a substantial short squeeze as bears were flushed out. However, funding rates remain neutral, reflecting a lack of excessive long-side leverage, something which Glassnode’s experts believe is a sign the rally could have more room to run. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also played an important role, peaking at $389 million on April 25 before tapering to around $58 million per day. Coinbase, a preferred exchange for U.S. institutional investors, recorded consistent buying. At the same time, the sell pressure on its global counterpart, Binance, eased from $71 million per day in March to just $9 million, suggesting investors were actively buying the dip. Long-Term Holders Cash In, But Demand Remains Strong Despite the rally, long-term Bitcoin holders have started taking profits, as CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain noted in a May 15 report. According to them, the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which tracks dormant coins being moved, has risen to 0.6. While it shows these holders are offloading dormant BTC for profit, the metric has not reached the 0.8 zone seen during previous bull market highs. Glassnode’s own data corroborates this trend, showing that short-term holder (STH) realized profits are spiking to nearly +3 standard deviations above the 90-day average. However, the analytics firm cautioned that profit-taking has not yet reached exhaustion levels, since in past rallies, higher deviations closer to +5 were needed to deplete demand and mark local tops.

2025-05-18T17:32:23.000Z,"Bitcoin Whale Outflows: Over 17,000 BTC Exit Exchanges in 7 Days","Crypto whales are on course to a full recovery, driving market sentiments to new highs not recorded since January. Over the past week, centralized digital asset exchanges have seen massive whale outflows signaling another wave of price momentum. This comes on the heels of strengthened institutional demand in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Bitcoin Metrics Are Bullish On-chain data shows a spike in trader sentiment as long-term holders move assets. Aside from several technical indicators pointing to a full recovery, Bitcoin holders are poised to reclaim the $100k mark. However, several commentators have warned against lingering risks. In the last seven days, Bitcoin whales transferred 17000 BTC from centralized exchanges to other custodians. As widely noted, this signals surging bull sentiments pointing to longer-term holdings. The large asset movement was also followed by a series of huge institutional buys reshaping the wider market. Data shows a bullish reaction from Binance whales in the last two weeks following the much-needed White House tariff lifeline. These whales correctly backed a price surge below $80k to present levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price jumped 12.3% within one week, showing strong momentum. Crypto trader Ali Martinez also noted that the digital asset leader is currently testing the yearly open above $93,500. Furthermore, the new trading volume on Binance hit a 30-day high above $62 million, highlighting fresh buying pressure. Analyst Crypto Dan cited important whale movements on the exchange, projecting positive whale movements. “ Recently, most people had shifted their view to a bearish cycle, and public interest had significantly decreased. Furthermore, with Bitcoin and altcoins in an oversold condition, the market has effectively shaken off the retail investors which means the market is now ready for a rise. I have been continuously highlighting this point through my analysis. The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is still expected to show positive movements.” Massive Rally Ahead? After the massive rally in crypto prices this week, traders speculate a wider upward movement close to peak levels earlier this year. This remains dicey as the bull confidence isn’t at those levels backing a fully-fledged altcoin season . At the moment, BTC’s price trades at $104,586, while the market cap has soared 5% to $2.07 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) is up 11% to $2,533, as traders are keen on the $2,000 level.

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Leading the Smart Money Shift in May","Introduction As the market heats up in May 2025, a new wave of high-conviction capital is quietly entering the crypto space. From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, all signs point to a smart money rotation underway — and the focus has locked onto four specific tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and TRON (TRX) . Each brings a unique angle to the table: macro safety, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and network volume efficiency. But for those seeking massive ROI , one altcoin in particular is drawing the most aggressive positioning. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads as one of the most-watched early-stage projects in Q2 2025 , with smart capital treating it as a strategic high-upside allocation before listings go live. The structure is simple: A hard listing target of $0.007 A unique narrative identity backed by a defined supply Analysts forecasting 25x–35x potential based on current entry levels Unlike legacy tokens that rely on broad utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE operates within a focused, conviction-driven ecosystem that appeals to speculators looking to repeat what early DOGE, SHIBA, or PEPE investors experienced in previous cycles. As Stage 8 accelerates , those entering now are doing so based on a structured risk-reward model, not hype. It’s this clarity that continues to attract high-risk, high-reward capital. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) remains the anchor for all capital entering crypto — and in May 2025, it’s holding steady around $103K–$104K , with analysts targeting $150K–$250K by year-end. Following ETF approvals, BTC has moved into macro-asset territory , with family offices, hedge funds, and sovereign capital now treating it as a reserve asset. This confidence trickles down, enabling capital to flow into riskier assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Bitcoin may not deliver 20,000% returns again, it is the catalyst enabling that opportunity in the altcoin space . XRP’s Derivatives and Payment Integration Fuel Demand XRP is now one of the most strategically positioned coins in the market. With price holding above $2.30 , and CME futures on the horizon, XRP is approaching its first institutional breakout moment since regulatory clarity was achieved. From a fundamentals perspective, XRP’s growing adoption in cross-border payments, liquidity provision, and institutional rails make it a favorite for analysts eyeing a move to $10–$30 in a high-volume environment. It’s not just a speculative play — it’s a settlement infrastructure layer that’s finally receiving validation from traditional finance. TRON (TRX) Maintains Its Quiet Strength in DeFi and Transfers TRON (TRX) has long operated in the background of the crypto conversation, but those paying attention know it’s one of the most practically used Layer-1 chains — particularly in stablecoin transactions. Currently priced near $0.27 , TRON remains a favorite in Asian markets and high-frequency payment corridors. Its consistent throughput, low fees, and stablecoin dominance continue to make it a resilient asset during both bull and bear phases. As speculative capital rotates into new narratives, TRON remains a quiet pillar of real-world crypto utility — one that smart money keeps holding. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The smart money in May is not chasing hype — it’s rotating into conviction. Bitcoin provides the trust layer , XRP brings the utility and institutional bridge , TRON delivers the volume backbone , and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most explosive early-stage upside among them all. For those aiming to turn $1,000 into life-changing returns , only a few windows remain — and based on risk-adjusted timing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now considered the most strategic early entry of the cycle .

2025-05-18T17:30:05.000Z,"Bitcoin Bulls Face Make-Or-Break Moment At $106,500 Resistance – Details","Popular digital asset analyst with X handle Crypto Patel has stated that Bitcoin is currently retesting a crucial price resistance at the $106,500 price region. Based on the asset’s performance at this level, BTC investors could expect a bullish price continuation or a significant price pullback. After a brief rise above $105,000 on May 12, Bitcoin has remained range-bound, showing no significant price movement since then. However, bullish sentiments remain high as demonstrated by US BTC spot ETFs scooping another almost $2 billion in net weekly investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10,000 Stairway: Chart Signals March Toward $115,000 Bitcoin At A Crossroads: Can Bulls Push To $120k — Or Does A Fall To $75k Await? In an X post on May 16, Crypto Patel shares a simple technical analysis on Bitcoin price movement, highlighting the present major support and resistance levels. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s most recent price gain shows the asset is retesting a critical resistance around the $106,500 price region. Notably, this resistance band has proved effective in inducing price rejections in December and January. If Bitcoin bulls can command sufficient market demand to subdue this price barrier, Crypto Patel projects the premier cryptocurrency will sustain its current uptrend with an initial price target set at $120,000. On the other hand, another price rejection could harm current investors’ expectations, as such negative development would force prices below the crucial $90,000 support zone to trade as low as the current market bottom at $75,000. This projected correction hints at a potential 27.1% decline from the present market price despite currently robust bullish sentiments. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Bitcoin has recently dipped from the overbought territory, thus supporting predictions of an impending price correction. However, macroeconomic developments such as the 90-day tariff truce between the US and China, and strong levels of institutional investment, boost the potential of a bullish trend continuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Prediction At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $103,355 following a 1.62% decline in the last week.

According to the prediction site, CoinCodex, investors are showing a high level of greed as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index at 74. Coincodex analysts are predicting Bitcoin to reach $127,872 in the next five days, followed by a price correction that will return prices to around $111,616. For long-term investment, the analyst projects Bitcoin to hit a valuation of $155,583 in three months and $148,167 in six months.

2025-05-18T17:24:07.000Z,"Ripple’s XRP Poised to See Billions in Inflows as XRP, Solana Top 72 ETF Pile on SEC Desk","72 ETF filings are stacked on the SEC’s desk, signaling a rise in investor appetite. XRP and Solana dominate the pile, but meme coins like DOGE and TRUMP are elbowing their way in. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has $6 million in crypto-related investments, faces a high-stakes decision. XRP and Solana Steal the Lead in ETF Filings. Data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reveals the numbers: 72 crypto ETF filings await SEC review. XRP ETF filings top the list with 18 applications. Solana follows close behind with 17. Together, they account for nearly half of the total pile. Why the huge number? XRP’s legal win against the SEC cleared its path, boosting confidence among ETF issuers. On the other hand, Solana’s appeal lies in its lightning-fast blockchain, processing thousands of transactions per second. These stats dwarf Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have dominated past ETF waves. Meme Coin ETFs: Risky Business? The filings take a sharp turn into meme coin territory. DOGE, PENGU, TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK all have pending ETF applications. Some even propose 2X leveraged funds, doubling the potential reward and risk. Leveraged ETFs amplify returns but magnify losses too. Meme coins, already volatile, could turbocharge this instability. DOGE, for instance, spiked 300% in 2021, then crashed 80% the next year, according to CoinGecko. Paul Atkins is the SEC’s new chair as of January 2025. His financial disclosures, filed in late 2024, show $6 million in crypto-related investments. This hefty stake raises eyebrows. Atkins’ holdings signal a personal tie to the market he now regulates. Analysts wonder how this shapes his view on the 72 filings. The SEC’s mandate—protecting investors—remains his north star, but his portfolio adds a layer of intrigue. No specifics on his assets are public, leaving analysts to parse the implications. These ETF filings could reshape crypto’s future. Approval might draw billions in institutional cash. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, launched in 2024, pulled in $10 billion in its first six months. XRP and Solana ETFs could follow suit. But meme coin ETFs pose a dilemma. Their approval might legitimize speculative assets, luring retail investors. Critics, like SEC veteran John Reed Stark, warn of “market chaos” in a 2023 tweet. Leverage only heightens the stakes. The SEC’s track record offers clues. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs got the green light in 2024 after years of rejections. This shift suggests a thaw in regulatory frost, but meme coins may test that limit.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-poised-to-see-billions-in-inflows-as-xrp-solana-top-72-etf-pile-on-sec-desk/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|SOL|Solana|trump|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-18T17:10:49.000Z,"Bitcoin retakes $105,000, now only 3.5% from a new all-time high","Bitcoin broke through $105,000 on Monday as traders responded to growing uncertainty across markets, pulling it within just 3.5% of its previous all-time high of $109,114. The coin is currently trading at $103,592, holding firm above $100,000, a level it hasn’t touched since early May, according to data from CoinGecko. The price has moved sideways for over a week, showing bulls aren’t backing off yet and are still waiting for the next leg up. Bitcoin has also surpassed the $2.1 trillion market cap. Since May 9, Bitcoin has been caught in a tight range, stuck between sellers capping its highs and buyers defending the lows. But the fact that it’s staying above $100K says a lot. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TrradingView Traders are clearly still holding positions, waiting for a push through the $105,787 resistance. If that level gets cleared, momentum could quickly drive it toward $120,000, a target that’s now being floated by analysts watching the charts. But if the bulls fumble and Bitcoin fails to break past its old record, short-term holders could start cashing out, leaving $100,000 wide open for a breakdown. A dip under $100,703 might trigger a deeper selloff, especially if market sentiment flips fast. Arthur Hayes sees Bitcoin as exit plan from US capital walls Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of Bitmex and now chief investment officer at Maelstrom, dropped his latest macro blog where he warned that the United States, under pressure from rising debt and heavy reliance on foreign funds, is likely to turn to capital controls as an alternative to tariffs. Arthur said this is going to be the next political move because it’s easier to explain to voters than more taxes or money printing. He outlined a 2% tax on foreign-owned US assets, which he estimated total $33 trillion, as a more enforceable policy than tariffs. Arthur said this kind of tax could cover the income taxes of 90% of Americans, making it politically attractive. But the consequences, according to him, would include a retreat of foreign investment from US markets. When that happens, Arthur believes the Federal Reserve will roll out stimulus again to stop the bleeding. That’s when Bitcoin steps into the spotlight. “Bitcoin will be the best-performing asset during this period of global monetary transformation,” Arthur wrote in the post. He said that even with capital restrictions, people will still be able to move money using the internet, adding, “As long as there is the internet, you will be able to sell fiat for bitcoin.” US stock rebound drives shift toward global exposure and crypto The broader market has now fully recovered from the April selloff. Major losses have been erased, and portfolios are back in the green. But for investors who rode the US stock market through the chaos without diversifying, this rebound is being seen as a rare second chance. Many are now being told to look abroad—and some are listening. Global markets actually outperformed US stocks from January through April. For example, the VXUS ETF—which tracks international markets—has brought in over $6 billion so far in 2025. But that still looks small next to the $63 billion that’s poured into Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) this year. That fund is on track to smash its previous annual inflow record. Despite that, analysts and portfolio managers are saying the message should be clear: investors who stayed too focused on US stocks need to balance out. Even old-school investing figures like Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle have always leaned US-centric, arguing that multinational US companies already earn revenue worldwide. But now Warren is reportedly dialing back on some of those long-held domestic bets and putting more capital into Japanese markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-18T16:58:38.000Z,"Bitcoin Nears Golden Cross Weeks After 'Trapping Bears' as U.S. Debt Concerns Mount","Bitcoin's BTC price chart is echoing a bullish pattern that foreshadowed the late 2024 price surge from $70,000 to $100,000 amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of the U.S. debt. The leading cryptocurrency by market value appears on track to confirm a \""golden cross\"" in the coming days, according to charting platform TradingView. The pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of prices crosses above the 200-day SMA to suggest that the short-term trend is outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run. The moving average-based golden cross has a mixed record of predicting price trends. The impending one, however, is worth noting because it's about to occur weeks after its ominous-sounding opposite, the death cross, trapped bears on the wrong side of the market. A similar pattern unfolded from August through September 2024, setting the stage for a convincing move above $70,000 in early November. Prices eventually set a record high above $109K in January this year. The chart on the left shows that BTC bottomed out at around $50,000 in early August last year as the 50-day SMA moved below the 200-day SMA to confirm the death cross. In other words, the death cross was a bear trap, much like the one in early April this year. Prices turned higher in subsequent weeks, eventually beginning a new uptrend after the appearance of the golden cross in late October 2024. The bullish sequence is being repeated since early April, and prices could begin the next leg higher following the confirmation of the golden cross in the coming days. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and technical patterns do not always deliver as expected. That said, macro factors seem aligned with the bullish technical setup. Moody's amplifies U.S. debt concerns On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the highest ”Aaa” to ”Aa1”, citing concerns over the increasing national debt, which has now reached $36 trillion. The bond market has been pricing fiscal concerns for some time. Last week, CoinDesk detailed how persistent elevated Treasury yields reflected expectations for continued fiscal splurge and sovereign risk premium, both bullish for bitcoin.

2025-05-18T16:55:21.000Z,"Moody’s Downgrades US Credit Score, Strips Final AAA Rating on Mounting Debt Concerns","Moody’s has joined the two other major rating agencies in determining that the US is no longer fit to hold a AAA credit score. On Friday, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. “As deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade. As a result, we expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. We anticipate that the federal debt burden will rise to about 134% of GDP by 2035, compared to 98% in 2024.” Moody’s latest decision strips the United States of its final Triple-A credit rating. The downgrade follows earlier moves by other major agencies: in 2011, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) lowered the US’ rating from AAA to AA+ due to concerns over the government’s inability to address rising debt levels. And in 2023, Fitch followed suit, citing persistent budget deficits and political infighting as key drivers of its downgrade.

2025-05-18T16:30:56.000Z,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Whales Are Quietly Accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE for 20,000% Potential","Introduction The whales are moving again — but this time, they’re not just topping up Bitcoin or Ethereum. A growing number of large-cap crypto holders are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , with early projections suggesting up to 20,000% upside if it mirrors early SHIBA, DOGE, or PEPE-style performance. With Stage 8 heating up , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the high-risk, high-reward entry play favored by smart money — while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin traders from Aptos (APT) position for the next big move. Here’s why analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive altcoin entry of the 2025 cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Early Whales Are Targeting MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret. While still in its pre-listing phase, this politically infused altcoin has caught the eye of whales looking for early-stage asymmetric returns . With a forecasted listing price of $0.007 and a growing wave of attention around its narrative, branding, and tokenomics, many now see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a real contender for 25x–200x returns . Why whales are quietly loading up: Narrative resonance with a massive cultural audience Structured entry pricing before exchanges open the floodgates Momentum-fueled cycle timing with BTC already showing strength This is no typical meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a strategic entry point — and those who understand early accumulation behavior are already acting. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Reinforces Market Confidence Bitcoin (BTC) remains the macro driver of all crypto cycles — and it is currently holding strong above $103,000 , reinforcing sentiment across altcoins. With institutional inflows still growing post-ETF approval and increasing use of BTC as a hedge against fiat devaluation, Bitcoin is helping pave the way for higher-risk plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE to flourish. Analysts continue pointing to $150K–$250K targets before year-end, and whale wallets are expanding — not just in BTC, but in smaller tokens with explosive upside. Ethereum’s Quiet Build-Up Toward ETF Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) may not be making headlines every day, but behind the scenes, the ecosystem is gaining strength. Upgrades like Pectra have improved performance, and ETH is expected to follow BTC’s lead with ETF approvals of its own. Currently trading near $2,600 , Ethereum is the foundation of smart contracts and DeFi. But more importantly, ETH whales are diversifying — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up on more radar screens as a pre-listing play with massive ROI appeal. Aptos (APT) Sees Event-Driven Gains — But Attention Is Drifting Aptos (APT) recently gained traction following the “Aptos Experience 2025” event, trading above $8.40 with volume surging. While APT’s tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure . MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA , where exponential upside still remains. APT may continue rising, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has a clearer short-term growth curve — and a much lower entry price. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion When whale wallets start positioning early, it usually means one thing: they see something retail investors haven’t caught onto yet . With MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerating through Stage 8, the combination of timing, tokenomics, and narrative is drawing serious accumulation from large BTC, ETH, and XRP holders. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the anchors of the market, it’s tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer the true breakout potential . And with whales quietly loading up, that breakout could arrive much sooner than the market expects.

The daily chart shows consistent resistance just above $107,000, with the latest candles forming in a compressed horizontal band, indicating indecision and low momentum. Related Reading: ‘Judgment Day Is Coming’—XRP Set To Explode, Analyst Warns This price behavior could be seen as a pause before the next leg higher. However, it could also be a trap that could cause a reversal towards $98,000. Daily Close Above $107K A Clear Breakout Signal Bitcoin’s current consolidation around the $103,000 price level has dragged on for over a week, and an eventual breakout could happen into any direction. In a recent post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted the importance of a daily close above $107,000 for a bullish Bitcoin. His chart illustrates that price has approached this threshold multiple times since December 2024 but failed to sustain a close on the daily timeframe. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a horizontal barrier just beneath $108,000. Notably, even Bitcoin’s all-time high of $108,786 on January 20 failed to close above the $107,000 price level on that day. According to Martinez, a confirmed close above this level could open the door for further upside movement toward new all-time highs. However, until this threshold is decisively cleared, Martinez warns that traders should be cautious and avoid forcing positions. Image From X: @ali_charts Potential Bitcoin Trap Setup And Liquidity Sweep To $98K A separate technical breakdown by crypto analyst TehThomas, published on TradingView, presents a far more cautious outlook for Bitcoin. Similarly, the analyst noted that Bitcoin has spent more than eight days locked in a narrow range between roughly $100,000 and $105,800. According to his liquidity-based framework, this range is likely being used as a trap to invite both long and short traders into premature breakout trades. His 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows a clear consolidation block, with price failing to escape either end, and liquidity pooling above $105,800 as well as under $100,000. TehThomas believes the equal highs near $105,800 are acting as bait for breakout longs. He expects Bitcoin to briefly sweep these highs, only to cause a fast and decisive move downwards into the lower demand zone between $98,000 and $97,500. This zone, marked as a large unmitigated fair value gap and golden pocket level on his chart, is where he expects the price to react next, once the liquidity on both sides is taken. Image From TradingView: TehThomas However, this short setup towards $98,000 would be invalidated if the Bitcoin price manages to hold above $105,800 and shows a continued strong volume and follow-through.

2025-05-18T16:00:00.000Z,"Shiba Inu loses bark: Memecoin rally cools amid falling burns, bets","The Shiba Inu price rally has stalled as trading volume, futures open interest, and its burn rate continue to decline. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, has dropped to $0.000015, down from this week’s high of $0.00001750. CoinGecko data shows that the daily volume has dropped in the past few weeks, signaling demand is drying up. Shiba Inu had a 24-hour volume of $173 million on Sunday, much lower than Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) $1.416 billion and Pepe’s ( PEPE ) $933 million. Its volume was also lower than that of other smaller meme coins, such as Official Trump, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Peanut the Squirrel. The same trend is happening in the futures market, where open interest has been downtrending after peaking at $272 million on May 11. It has dropped to $216 million, a smaller figure than other meme coins like Bonk and Pepe.

A high open interest is a sign of high volume and liquidity. Shiba Inu price has also dropped as the daily burn rate has slowed in the past few days. Data shows that the daily burn rate dropped by 78% on Sunday to 3.3 million. Less than 70 million SHIB coins were burned since Tuesday last week. Shiba Inu burns are usually bullish because they reduce the amount of coins in circulation and boost market sentiment. Further, the total value locked in the Shibarium network has dropped in the last seven days. It fell from $3.98 million to $3.41 million, with most dApps in the ecosystem, like ShibaSwap and K9 Finance, losing assets. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing Shiba Inu Coin consolidation could be calm before the storm and a surge. The weekly chart shows that the SHIB price has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00001076. A double-bottom often leads to a strong bullish breakout, potentially to the neckline, which, in this case, is at the November high of $0.00003390, up by 133% from the current level. Shiba Inu is also forming the popular harmonic pattern known as XABCD. It has already completed the XA, AB, and BC phases and is now in the early stages of the last CD phase. If this happens, the SHIB price will likely bounce back and hit the 2024 high of $0.00004618, up by 227% from the current level.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.

A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”Crypto market data daily view.

If that happens, Bitcoin could be in for a deeper pullback.Could buyers drive the price to a new all-time high, pulling select altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin bulls are struggling to propel the price above the $105,000 overhead resistance, but a positive sign is that the $100,000 support has held.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($99,416) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone signal that bulls remain in control. If the price closes above $105,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to break above the $109,588 resistance. If that happens, the pair could surge to $130,000.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($90,628).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) pullback is finding support at the breakout level of $2,550, signaling that every minor dip is being purchased.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $2,750, the ETH/USDT pair could resume its up move. There is resistance at $2,860, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then climb to $3,000.The $2,400 level is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break below it could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($2,225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has reached the resistance line after turning down from the overhead resistance of $2.65 on May 14.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price dips below the resistance line, it suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. That increases the likelihood of a range-bound action between $2.65 and $2 for a few days.Conversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line signals that the bulls are attempting to flip the level into support. Sellers may pose a solid challenge at $2.65, but if the bulls prevail, the XRP/USDT pair could reach $3.BNB price predictionBuyers have successfully defended the $644 level in BNB (BNB), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests that the bears have kept up the pressure.BNB/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will strive to kick the price to the overhead resistance at $693.On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the higher levels are attracting solid selling by the bears. The BNB/USDT pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($604).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) is facing stiff resistance at $180, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($161) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.17), suggesting a possible range formation in the near term. Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) turned down from $0.86 on May 12 and dropped to the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA strong rebound off the neckline suggests a positive sentiment where the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to shove the price above the $0.86 resistance.

Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the $5 to $5.37 zone.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the pair down to $3.12.Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) has turned down from the resistance line of the descending channel pattern, implying that the bears are selling on rallies.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA minor positive is that the bulls have successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($15.56). Buyers will again attempt to thrust the price above the resistance line. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $19.80 and then to $21.30.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price plummets below the neckline. The pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA ($14), which is a crucial support to watch out for. A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 20-day EMA ($22.78) on May 15, indicating buying on dips.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA continues to slope up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling an advantage to buyers.

They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it shows that the markets have rejected the breakout.
