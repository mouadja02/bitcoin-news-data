2025-05-18T13:46:38.000Z,"Move Over Cardano: 3 Explosive New Crypto Picks","Cardano is back in the headlines with fresh price predictions suggesting it could hit $10 by 2031. Ethereum is surging, Bitcoin is aiming for the $120K mark, and suddenly crypto is alive again. Market watchers are calling for an altcoin season revival, and early signs are everywhere. Dogecoin whales are on the move, gobbling up over $1B Dogecoin over the past month, while XRP has staged a sharp V-shaped rally. Together, these events are creating the perfect cocktail for retail FOMO. The spotlight may be on the big names for now, but smart investors are already looking further down the list – toward the new crypto projects with far more room to run. Altcoin Season 2.0 Is Here – And the Clues Are All Around Us Cardano’s long-term potential is encouraging, but the real action might be coming much sooner and from unexpected places. Ethereum’s recent breakout has reignited bullish momentum across the board. If Bitcoin really is on track to reach $120K , as some analysts suggest, we’re likely heading straight into another altcoin supercycle. The data backs it up. Whale wallets are snapping up meme coins like Dogecoin again – a typical early sign of renewed retail interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s sharp price surge hints that risk appetite is back in play. Altcoin season isn’t coming – it’s starting. And while top-10 coins will no doubt see gains, history tells us the biggest returns often come from smaller, undervalued projects during these windows of market enthusiasm. From meme-fueled utility to sustainable infrastructure plays, here are three of the best altcoins that could leave Cardano in the dust by the end of 2025. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Powering the Future of Web3 Solaxy ($SOLX) is rewriting the rules of blockchain scalability as the first-ever Layer 2 solution built specifically for Solana. While Ethereum has long dominated the Layer 2 conversation, Solaxy brings that same performance boost to Solana – only faster and with lower fees. At its core, Solaxy neutralizes Solana’s biggest pain points: network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. In return, it amplifies the very things that made Solana popular – blazing speed and dirt-cheap fees. RIght now, you can buy $SOLX for $0.001728. With over $37M raised in presale, $SOLX is gaining serious traction. It’s a multichain token launching on both Ethereum and Solana, giving it direct access to the two largest ecosystems in crypto. That means more liquidity, more users, and more upside potential. But Solaxy isn’t just another scaling solution – it’s a bridge to the next generation of DeFi. It connects Ethereum’s massive asset tokenization and DeFi infrastructure with Solana’s high-speed environment. $SOLX also unlocks meme coin trading for the masses by democratizing access to high-frequency trading tools, leveling the playing field for everyday users. And in a market heating up with surging meme coins and revived altcoin appetite, Solaxy looks like a perfect storm of utility, access, and timing. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Where Memes Meet AI Mind of Pepe ($MIND) isn’t just riding the meme coin hype – it’s steering the ship with an AI-powered rocket strapped to the back. At the heart of this project is the first-ever self-evolving, crypto-native AI agent designed to interact directly with the crypto world on platforms like X . It analyzes trends, generates content, and even influences market conversation. Think of it like a meme-savvy ChatGPT with a mission to make its holders rich. Already active and engaging users, this AI agent does more than just chat. It offers trading insights, tracks market trends, and delivers exclusive alpha to $MIND holders through token-gated community channels. It even has the power to launch its own tokens and give early access to holders – a massive edge in today’s fast-paced meme coin environment. With $9.5M already raised in its presale and the launch just two weeks away, timing couldn’t be better. The broader AI token market is up 60% this month, and $MIND is set to launch into full-blown bullish conditions. Currently priced at $0.0037515, $MIND’s price could soar to $0.00535 in 2025 – and potentially 10x by 2030 if momentum holds. As Dogecoin whales re-enter the market and meme coin mania builds, $MIND is perfectly placed to capitalize. 3. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – The Intelligent Meme Coin Dawgz AI is where meme culture meets serious trading tech – a perfect storm for altcoin season. Priced at just $0.004 with the next presale tier set to increase it to $0.00438, $DAGZ has already raised $3.6M and is building momentum fast. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, this project is backed by a real AI engine designed to make smart trading decisions in real time. The Dawgz AI trading bot scans the market 24/7, using on-chain data and social sentiment to identify profitable opportunities. It then feeds this intel into a user-friendly dashboard that helps traders take action quickly. Even if you’re new to crypto, $DAGZ makes it easy to trade like a pro by simplifying data into clear signals and automating execution. But it’s not all bots and charts – Dawgz AI also knows how to have fun. The project has built a strong, engaged community with meme contests, giveaways, and a loyal pack of retail investors who believe this could be the next big breakout in the meme coin + AI niche. With Dogecoin whales stirring and retail energy coming back into the market, $DAGZ may be in the right place at exactly the right time. New Faces, Bigger Upside? Cardano may be grabbing headlines, but newcomers like Solaxy , Mind of Pepe , and Dawgz AI are where the real fireworks could happen in 2025. Each project brings something fresh – from multichain DeFi infrastructure to meme-fueled AI and smart trading automation. As altcoin season heats up, these three could leave the old giants in the dust. This article is for informational purposes only and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

2025-05-18T13:10:26.000Z,"Stocks, Bitcoin, and gold within striking distance of ATHs, bullish breakout brewing?","The global digital assets market saw a marginal surge on Sunday morning to stand $3.31 trillion cap. This comes after witnessing a week of fluctuations. The rise in Bitcoin’s dominance, in a way, pressured altcoins to perform as retail investors are still absent. However, the stock markets and crypto remained nearly correlated. The ongoing 90-day tariff pause between the US and China has markets within striking distance of their all-time highs. Meanwhile, Moody’s delivered a shock downgrade to the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. It cited soaring deficits and a mounting debt burden. S&P, BTC, gold near ATHs As per the data, S&P 500 is trading at a current price of $5,958 after setting its all-time high of $6,147 on February 19, 2025. It is only 3.27% away from its ATH. Gold is also trading around $3,200 per ounce, after posting its ATH of $3,509 on April 22, 2025. The precious metal is just 9% out from hitting its fresh ATH. A Goldman Sachs report stated that investors have been increasing their holdings of gold since March. It was driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and a surprising surge in demand from central banks. But not all moves have made sense to investors. The recent 5% drop in gold prices , which mirrors a fall in equities, confused some investors. The analyst suggests that gold’s status as a haven asset hasn’t gone anywhere. As stocks sank, investors sold gold to raise cash for collateral, not because they lost faith in it. On the traditional market side, a bullish sentiment is spreading among investors.

It is the lowest since mid-February. This has eventually marked the end of the record streak of 11 consecutive weeks with over 50% bearishness. Bitcoin hovers near $104K Soft US inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cuts have managed to keep the crypto market up and going. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index also improved market sentiment. Bitcoin price hovered around $103k-$104k over the past week. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,894 as of press time, inching closer to its ATH of $109,026, recorded on January 20, 2025. The biggest crypto is just 5% away from hitting its fresh high. Its surging dominance (62.5%) in the market hints that a rally might be 0n. In the meantime, the biggest altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have managed to cover some ground.

2025-05-18T13:00:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Could Be Preparing For Fresh Wave Of Volatility — Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price action over the weekend has been quite sluggish, reflecting the indecision and fatigue seemingly hovering over the cryptocurrency market at the moment. After a dour performance during the week, the premier cryptocurrency has continued to trade within the $92,000 – $95,000 range on Saturday, May 17. With the choppy price action, doubt about the Bitcoin price reclaiming its all-time high of $108,786 is starting to creep in. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader could be gearing up for significant price movements over the next few weeks. Open Interest Metric Predicts What’s Next For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Alphractal delved into fresh on-chain observations revolving around the price of Bitcoin and the open interest (OI) cycle. According to the market intelligence firm, the BTC open interest data is exhibiting certain patterns that have coincided with major price moves in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Typically, the open interest metric measures the total amount of money flowing into BTC derivatives at any given period. Meanwhile, the OI Delta indicator estimates changes in the open interest over a specific timeframe. Firstly, Alphractal highlighted that the 30-day Open Interest Delta recently reached the same levels seen during the Bitcoin price rise to its previous all-time high around $73,737 in 2024. This pattern shows that the BTC market could be at the beginning of a cyclical behavioral change. Alphractal said: A familiar pattern is emerging: alternating cycles of increase and decrease in the Open Interest Delta — what we might call Phase 1 and Phase 2. After a strong buildup of positions (positive Delta), we often see a nearly proportional drop (negative Delta), showing clear cyclical behavior in the market. Furthermore, Alphractal noted that the 180-day Open Interest Delta offers a more interesting insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory in the coming weeks. According to the market intelligence firm, a negative 180-day OI Delta metric is usually associated with a market bottom or an accumulation trend. As shown in the chart above, the 180-day Open Interest Delta sits just above the negative territory, which suggests that the Bitcoin price could witness increased volatility in the coming weeks. However, it is worth mentioning that a cross beneath the zero threshold could also signal the start of a new consolidation phase. Alphractal concluded on X: Overall, Open Interest has not grown proportionally like it did from October 2023 to early 2024 — and again from October 2024 into early 2025. These yearly patterns may suggest a fractal behavior in investor risk appetite. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,367, reflecting a 0.4% decline in the past 24 hours.

Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative. Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg. After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

The report noted: \""Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"" \""The US' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,\"" the newly revised credit outlook predicted.

Speaking in a recent interview , Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up. “250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

According to reports, the woman, in her 40s, carried out the theft while her boyfriend was sleeping. Prosecutors did not reveal the name of the perpetrator during the trial. According to reports , the accused woman stole around 683 million won, worth approximately $488,000. She carried out the theft in January, with the sentencing being carried out this week. During her trial, the woman was also convicted on charges of embezzlement after it was discovered she also stole 2 million won in cash, worth about $1,430. The news was reported by local media in South Korea. South Korean woman sent to jail for crypto theft According to the authorities, the crime occurred at 11:50 PM at her boyfriend’s house in Jeju City, South Korea, on January 5. They said that the woman had carefully memorized her boyfriend’s login details in the hopes that she would access his account when he went to bed. While he was sleeping, the woman took his phone and used his bank apps and exchanges to transfer funds to her personal accounts. Authorities mentioned that after stealing the money, the South Korean woman fled the location, boarding a plane to another part of the country. She had the intention of staying there and enjoying the stolen funds. However, things did not go the way she had thought as the police nabbed her at a hotel near Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province. She was subsequently arrested and moved back to Jeju City to answer for her crimes. According to the details of the case, the woman admitted to the charges, noting that she carried out the criminal act on January 5 while her boyfriend was sleeping. She also mentioned that she had returned most of the funds, noting that she only owes around 21.9 million won, worth about $15,000. The woman also asked the court for leniency because she had returned part of the funds and is remorseful about her actions. Uptick in crypto-related crimes causes concerns The media in South Korea mentioned that the court refused her plea of leniency because she is a repeat offender, given her history of fraud, and the amount of money owed was still substantial. The case was handled by the court in Jeju province, South Korea. The woman’s legal representatives also urged the courts for mercy, citing their client’s remorse and her actions towards refunding the stolen funds. They argued that the woman owes a smaller amount of money compared to what she originally stole on January 5. The court, during the announcement of the verdict, mentioned that the woman was a repeat offender. The court said she had two previous convictions for fraud, with one of them heading to trial before she stole her boyfriend’s digital assets. The judge refused to consider her plea or give her a second chance because she had repeatedly been given second chances, which she has continually wasted. The judge handed her a two-year jail term. The conviction adds to an increasing number of crypto-related crimes in Jeju and globally, as peer-to-peer trades are now leading to theft, assault, and even murder. In January, a man in his 30s was found stabbed to death in a hotel in Jeju after travelling there to attend a private crypto meeting. In another case, four Chinese nationals were apprehended for stealing $63,000 in digital assets. The same month, 22-year-old Maissa Jebali was arrested for stealing TRUMP meme coins from her ex-boyfriend. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

DOGE is the world’s first meme coin and one of the oldest digital currencies, dating back to 2014. It started as a joke as the founder, Billy Markus, copied Bitcoin’s code to start a network but changed the font to Comic Sans, which is used in the popular Shiba dog meme. But, with time, the meme coin sector started to attract major attention in the crypto community, peaking during the 2020-2021 bull market when the digital currency rose a spectacular 600000% in just a few months, leaving crypto traders in awe. DOGE’s incredible success powered a massive foray into the meme coin economy that still sees dozens of new tokens released daily. However, DOGE’s major exploits during the 2020-2021 bull market haven’t been replicated in the 2024-2025 edition. The cryptocurrency has yet to come close to the $0.7 All-Time High price point, and if it fails to do so, a major rally will remain elusive. On-chain Activity Surge Nevertheless, a recent surge in the cryptocurrency network’s on-chain activity may spark the bullish forces. According to popular X influencer Ali Martinez, over 280,000 active addresses have been witnessed in the last couple of days, showing strong improvement in on-chain activity. The flurry of blockchain network undertakings is now reaching new six-month highs. Here is the graph shared by Martinez: Image Source: X Price Trend Here is the graph of DOGE from the last couple of months or so: The coin is trading around $0.224, up from $0.17 just a week ago. According to top analysts, a major boost is needed in the ensuing months if the $1 price target is to be realized in the coming months. Analysts are confident that the $1 goal is achievable, and the meme coin economy’s continued short-term exploits mean that the joke token sector is here to stay. However, a move similar to 2020-2021 may not be expected. Overall, DOGE is scheduled to cement itself among the Top Ten cryptocurrencies during this bull market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-on-chain-activity-nears-6-month-high-1-doge-price-target-confirmed/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin",cryptocompare

Broadcasting live data from the exchange it was opened on – Hyperliquid, CoinGlass’s live feed shows that the liquidation price is set at $95,576. A WHALE JUST OPENED $276 MILLION 40X LONG POSITION ON BITCOIN THE LIQUIDATION PRICE IS $95,000 WHALE OR INSIDER ? pic.twitter.com/79Aopmbl1m — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 17, 2025 Numerous crypto content creators and influencers picked up the massive position on Saturday evening, which at first was worth a more modest $276 million. The initial entry price was $103,129. However, live data from CoinGlass shows that the mysterious whale capitalized on a brief opportunity they had when bitcoin’s price slipped below $103,000 to double down on their position, which is now worth over $393 million (3,790 BTC). The entry price has been lowered to $103,083, but the liquidation still stands at just shy of $95,600. Given BTC’s current price tag of almost $104,000, the whale stands on a “modest” unrealized profit of $3.3 million as of now. There have been quite a few cases in the past couple of months in which mysterious whales opened large positions on Hyperliquid that caught the community’s attention. Recall another example from March this year when someone opened a massive multi-million-dollar short position. Later, popular crypto sleuth ZachXBT claimed that this was William Parker, a UK individual linked to a $1 million casino theft among other scandals. According to the reports, Parker profited around $20 million by using extremely high leverage to open positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which allowed him to manipulate the market.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.29. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.31 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7585 Market Cap $26.79 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $774.59M Circulating Supply 35.32 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7683 24-hour Low $0.7295 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.18% 50-day SMA $ 0.688835 14-Day RSI 50.67 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the token is currently trading near $0.757, and shows a modest upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.84, meaning that the coin is in a neutral momentum with potential room for further gains before reaching overbought territory. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, and the price is trending above the middle band, which often indicates bullish continuation. The upper band resistance around $0.854 may act as a short-term ceiling. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could target the $0.90 zone. Support lies near $0.741. Momentum appears cautiously bullish pending a decisive breakout or rejection. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA) on May 18, the price is currently trading at approximately $0.759, nestled between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands. This suggests a neutral-to-bullish posture but lacks strong directional momentum. The MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line and signal line dipping below the zero axis, hinting at potential short-term weakness. The Balance of Power (BoP) reads negative, pointing to a slight bearish pressure in recent sessions. If the price breaks below $0.737, a correction toward $0.70 may follow. However, maintaining above $0.764 could preserve the bullish structure. Traders should watch for volume confirmation. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.71118 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.768671 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.787472 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.744714 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.688835 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.723624 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.679917 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.723315 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.696251 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.674927 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.681013 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.721942 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.756792 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.725817 BUY What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts of Cardano (ADA), the asset currently demonstrates a neutral-to-cautiously bullish setup. On the daily chart, ADA is trading near $0.757, slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating an effort to recover upward momentum. The RSI hovers around 59, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment without overbought pressure. However, price action shows resistance near $0.80. On the 4-hour chart, ADA has slipped slightly, with MACD showing a weakening bullish signal and the Balance of Power turning negative. This reflects fading bullish strength in the short term. A sustained hold above $0.737 may preserve upside potential, while a drop below risks a correction. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $1.00, with an average trading price of about $0.88 and a minimum price of $0.85. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $7.10. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.92 and $7.10, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $7.10. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $10.31. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.68, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $7.10. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano The Cardano Builder Fest #2 is scheduled for April 2025 in Vietnam. Developer Andrew Westberg has proposed reducing the treasury tax from 20% to 10%, which has been the subject of much discussion. Some argue that this would boost staking incentives and short-term price growth, while others worry about its impact on Cardano’s long-term sustainability.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.264 Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. In January 2025, Cardano traded around $1.02 and $1.09. However, the closing price for Cardano in January was $0.9. In February 2025, ADA surged toward $0.81 but it declined toward $0.64 by the end of the month. ADA value dropped further in March as it dipped to the $0.60 range. In April, ADA price dropped below $0.55 but it later surged toward $0.7. ADA ended April at $0.7030.

2025-05-18T11:45:44.000Z,"‘Epidemic of Scams’ Flooding Instagram and Facebook Affecting Many Different Industries, Says Meta: Report","Meta executives are reportedly acknowledging a serious new problem with scams affecting its social media platforms. A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of social media behemoths Instagram and Facebook, tells the Wall Street Journal that the corporate giant is dealing with “an epidemic of scams” that has been growing exponentially in recent years, both in scale and sophistication. “As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts.” The spokesperson reveals that Meta is experimenting with facial-recognition technology while also forming partnerships with banks and tech firms since the scams are affecting so many industries and “different parts of society.” Citing people familiar with the matter, WSJ also reports that JPMorgan Chase has raised concerns with Meta about its policing – or lack thereof – of scams. Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase customers between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a WSJ source. JPMorgan also recently began blocking certain Zelle payments and warning users about transactions originating from social media platforms like Meta. The person said that the number of scams linked to Meta has shown improvement in recent months. However, documents seen by WSJ reportedly show that Meta has recently deprioritized enforcing scams, avoiding takedowns of erroneous advertisements because of supposed safety concerns, while also cutting costs and moving resources to other departments. WSJ interviewed Edgar Guzman, the owner of a home improvement supplies and garden equipment company in Atlanta, who said scams are relentlessly targeting his customers, prompting them to make payments for products that never arrive. Says Guzman, “What sucks is we have to break it to people that they’ve been scammed – we don’t even do online sales… We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Last time this happened in 2021, a bevy of popular altcoins returned cryptocurrency buyers 28,000% by the end of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Takes 4% Spill Bitcoin’s market share fell from 65% to 61% between May 7 and May 13, according to TradingView. Markets haven’t seen that 65% level of BTC dominance over altcoins since 2021. That year was the altseason, as crypto veterans like to call it, that launched Dogecoin’s price tens of thousands of percent upward in under 12 months. Meanwhile, in 2021, a $100 Shiba Inu investment went from Jan. 1, 2021, to over $14 million by Mar. 2023. Two unemployed Millennial brothers from Westchester, NY, invested $8,000 in Shiba Inu that year after a family friend told them about it. There are hundreds of trillions of dollars out there. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin . Do the math. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 8, 2025 As Bitcoin boosters like to say: Do the math. While a 4% dip in Bitcoin dominance may seem like a small fraction, the numerator here is a global Internet currency with a two trillion dollar market cap on May 7. That’s something like an $80 billion dip in market share against altcoins over six days in May. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price and market cap grew by 7% during those six days, even as its wedge on the pie chart shrank. Altcoins Form Bullish Golden Cross Meanwhile, an index of altcoin prices formed a golden cross in May, potentially signaling bullish momentum into a prolonged bull run. As one popular crypto YouTube analyst reported on May 13, the total altcoin market cap for major currencies has formed a golden cross.

2025-05-18T11:18:20.000Z,"Average Investors Build Wealth Faster With Bitcoin Solaris Than With Cardano: New Data Reveals Why","The post Average Investors Build Wealth Faster With Bitcoin Solaris Than With Cardano: New Data Reveals Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano has long been the poster child for long-term believers. It’s academic, secure, and designed for the future. But what if you could stop waiting for the future—and start building real wealth today? That’s exactly what average investors are doing with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While Cardano holders rely on slow staking and price movement, BTC-S users are already seeing explosive gains from a blockchain designed not for institutions, but for everyday people with a smartphone and a dream. And the numbers? They’re not just better—they’re life-changing. Cardano: Brilliant Design, Slower Rewards Cardano’s layered architecture and peer-reviewed foundation have earned it respect across the crypto space. But when it comes to helping users generate real wealth fast, it’s often too slow. Staking returns are modest, and like many Proof-of-Stake networks, they require time, patience, and locked funds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris has skipped the academic papers and delivered something more powerful—daily income and real-world utility. Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Make People Rich This isn’t a clone of Bitcoin. This is a reimagining of what it should’ve been for the masses. A dual-consensus model gives BTC-S an edge: PoW (Proof-of-Work) for foundational security DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) for speed and scale 10,000 transactions per second, 2-second finality, and 99.95% less energy usage than Bitcoin mining. It doesn’t just protect wealth. It builds it fast. BTC-S is a blockchain that generates value every day, directly into your hands, using only your phone. The project is also audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and fully KYC-verified , giving new investors confidence that this isn’t just hype. It’s substance. From Zero to Wealth: How BTC-S Is Changing Lives We’re not talking theory. We’re talking early BTC-S investors already reporting 300–400% gains thanks to presale access and daily mobile mining rewards. The upcoming Solaris Nova App will allow users to mine BTC-S from any smartphone, with one tap. There are no setups, no rigs, and no confusing software. Just a smart algorithm that runs quietly in your pocket—earning real money every day. And thanks to the double rewards referral program, the growth doesn’t stop there. Users who refer friends receive 5% commission in BTC-S every time someone buys through their link. Even better? The person they invite gets 5% extra tokens on their purchase. It’s a win-win model built to multiply community wealth—fast. To access it, all you need is an account on BitcoinSolaris.com, your personal referral code, and the motivation to share it with your network. From social media to direct invites, the earning potential grows every time you connect someone new. What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early? Bitcoin Solaris vs Cardano: Why BTC-S Wins for Wealth Builders Feature Cardano Bitcoin Solaris Daily Earnings Slow staking rewards Mobile mining pays daily Hardware Needed None None Energy Efficiency High 99.95% less than Bitcoin Earning Boost System None 5% referral commission + 5% bonus Average Investor Wealth Rate Gradual 3x–4x faster returns (reported) Presale Firepower The BTC-S presale is where the real money’s already flowing: Current Price: $3 Next Phase: $4 Launch Price: $20 Over 8,900 users have joined so far, and the project has raised more than $750,000, making it one of the fastest-growing token sales in 2025. The presale runs for just 90 days and ends July 31, 2025. With a projected 1,900% return, early buyers are locking in gains most Cardano holders haven’t seen in years. Community members also get beta access to the Solaris Nova App, offering them a front-row seat to the mining revolution before the full app goes live. Limited-Time Bonus: Earn Up to 75% More BTC-S in Phase 3 For a short time during Phase 3, Bitcoin Solaris investors can unlock exclusive bonus tokens by contributing set amounts: Invest $1,000 → Get 25% Bonus ($1,250 in BTC-S) Invest $2,500 → Get 50% Bonus ($3,750 in BTC-S) Invest $4,000 → Get 75% Bonus ($7,000 in BTC-S) This offer is only valid during Phase 3 and for new purchases. Once this phase ends or bonus tokens run out—whichever comes first—the event will close. The Crypto Community Is Paying Attention Influencers across the space are already catching on. A recent deep dive from Crypto Legends explains why Bitcoin Solaris is grabbing headlines: its mobile mining model, explosive growth, and tokenomics that reward the little guy, not just whales. Stay connected with the team and receive real-time updates on Telegram and X . Conclusion: Stop Hoping. Start Earning. The people building wealth aren’t crypto elites. They’re teachers, students, creators, and casual investors who got in early—and tapped into a mobile mining ecosystem that’s actually paying them. The app is live in beta. The rewards are flowing. The presale window is closing. And the future? It’s already in the hands of those who tapped first.

2025-05-18T11:17:29.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for May 19: Bulls Eye $104K but Momentum Still Mixed","The Bitcoin price today is trading around $103,650, attempting to stabilize just below the key $104,000 resistance zone after a brief consolidation phase. While the macro trend remains bullish, the recent Bitcoin price action shows tightening within a symmetrical triangle formation on lower time frames, suggesting that a breakout—or breakdown—may be imminent heading into May 19. What’s Happening with Bitcoin’s Price? Looking at the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to respect a rising support trendline that connects the early May lows to the current structure. After surging from sub-$100,000 levels earlier this month, the Bitcoin price has faced repeated rejections just under $105,000. The consolidation near $103,300–$103,800 represents a period of indecision following the bullish rally, but structure remains intact as long as bulls defend $101,500. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Multiple triangle breakouts since April have fueled Bitcoin price spikes, but current candles suggest caution.

2025-05-18T11:01:32.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Technical Breakout at $2,520 Targets $2,745 Resistance—What Is Next for ETH in June?","Ethereum (ETH/USD) is back in the spotlight as it tests a key resistance zone inside a symmetrical triangle. At the moment, ETH is trading around $2,508, below both the triangle’s upper trendline and the 50-period EMA ($2,519) on the 2-hour chart. Some expected an early breakout, but price is still coiled, no confirmed break above resistance. This triangle formation, created by converging trendlines, means consolidation and decreasing volatility—a classic sign of a big move coming. ETH has held a series of higher lows, keeping the bullish case alive, but buyers haven’t produced a strong breakout candle yet. Volume is low and recent candles are showing hesitation with mixed body sizes and small wicks. Ethereum Momentum Building as MACD Turns Bullish Momentum indicators are hinting at a change in sentiment. MACD is showing a fresh bullish crossover and the histogram is green—often a sign of upward momentum. Ethereum Price Setup ETH is coiling inside a symmetrical triangle, trading near $2,509 and pressing against key resistance. Watch for a breakout above $2,527 to confirm momentum. No breakout yet—just pressure building. #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto #Trading #ETHUSD #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/kNYkrIUM9R — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 This, combined with higher lows in price, means buyers are gaining strength, but confirmation is missing. If ETH can break above $2,527—triangle’s upper boundary and horizontal resistance—it will trigger bullish targets at $2,649 and $2,720. Below $2,500 or a break below $2,420 will invalidate the setup and test lower support. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction remains neutral as ETH hasn’t broken out yet, but the setup is getting close to resolution. Watch for breakout volume or rejection. Patience is key in triangle setups—entering too early can be choppy. Trade Setup: Entry (bullish): Above $2,527 on strong bullish close Targets: $2,649 and $2,720 Stop-loss: Below $2,420 (triangle support) Summary: Think of this triangle like a pressure cooker—it’s building steam, but unless the lid pops off (above $2,527), price will stay contained. Wait for breakout confirmation before entering. Ethereum is consolidating at resistance, a big move is coming. Whether bulls can take advantage remains to be seen—but all eyes are on $2,527. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

2025-05-18T10:59:01.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Inches Towards $105,000 As Overall Sentiment Remains Bullish","Bitcoin (BTC) price action has remained subdued over the weekend as the flagship cryptocurrency trades within a narrow price band extending from $100,000 to $105,000. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,722 on Saturday but rebounded to briefly cross $104,000 before moving to its current level. The cryptocurrency has registered a marginal increase during the ongoing session, trading around $103,950. Bitcoin May Skyrocket As US Loses Top Tier Credit Rating The US has lost its AAA credit rating over rising national debt and deficits. Moody’s Rating downgraded the US credit rating, downgrading it from its perfect AAA status to AA1 due to increasing debt and interest significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. The downgrade is being viewed as a warning to investors and could increase borrowing costs for Americans already grappling with inflation and tariffs. Moody’s had held a perfect credit score for the US since 1917. Moody’s explained the downgrade in its official statement, adding, “The downgrade reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” However, despite the downgrade, Moody’s assigned a stable outlook for the country, highlighting the Federal Reserve’s historically strong and independent monetary policy. However, this outlook could be at risk, with President Trump threatening to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, an adverse market reaction forced Trump to backtrack. Journalist Michelle Makori believes that Bitcoin and gold are worth watching following the downgrade, adding she expected their prices to skyrocket. According to Makori, the downgrade creates the perfect environment for Bitcoin and gold prices to surge. “Watch Bitcoin and gold. America now shares a credit rating with Austria and Finland. Hard assets don’t lie. Watch Gold and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Whales Accumulating Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are continuing to accumulate the asset, according to OKC Partner and Binance KOL Ted Pillows. According to analysts, Bitcoin Whales acquired 2,180 BTC valued at around $226,750,000 on May 15, indicating strong market confidence. Large accumulations by Bitcoin whales generally suggest bullish sentiment among investors and a strong potential for further price appreciation. BTC is trading around the $103,900 mark at the time of writing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $100,000 despite selling pressure and buyer exhaustion. Market watchers are watching for signs of an uptrend and whether it will carry BTC past its all-time high of $109,000. Despite waning momentum, market experts believe BTC’s uptrend is far from over. Blockstream CEO Adam Beck stated earlier in the week that Bitcoin’s price was strangely low and could surge to $500,000 or even $1M over the next four years. Meanwhile, another analyst predicted that BTC’s next market top could be $120,000, but only if the $90,000 support holds. However, some bearish signals are emerging despite overall bullish sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp increase of 2.19% on Tuesday, settling at $96,845. A marginal increase the following day saw the price reach $97,000. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, crossing $100,000 and settling at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. However, it recovered on Saturday, rising nearly 2% to $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, falling almost 1% and settling at $103,802. Source: TradingView BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped 1.04% to $102,728, but not before falling to an intraday low of $100,694. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235.

2025-05-18T10:55:02.000Z,"Best Meme Coin to Buy Now? Apple’s Market Signal Pushes Crypto Momentum","If you're trying to find the best meme coin to buy as 2025 unfolds, you're not alone. Apple just made waves in the traditional market by announcing a $0.26 per-share dividend on May 15, 2025, and while that may seem unrelated to crypto, it’s actually a signal worth watching. When a $2.9 trillion company boosts market sentiment, it can ripple through institutional strategies—including crypto investments. Stocks climbed, and within hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum surged in tandem. In the world of meme coins, that type of risk-on momentum can be a green light. In this piece, we’ll break down how traditional market events like Apple’s dividend can push meme coin sentiment forward, and spotlight one project— Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —that could become the best meme coin to buy right now. Market Signals: Why Apple’s Dividend Matters to Crypto Investors On May 15, Apple confirmed a $0.26 per-share dividend, and while the payout is standard, the implications are bigger. Apple’s stock rose by 1.2%, Nasdaq jumped 0.8%, and suddenly risk appetite was back on the table. At the same time: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.1%, hitting $63,600. Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.8%, reaching $2,980. BTC trading volume spiked by 15% to $28B in 24 hours. ETH trading volume hit $12.5B—a 10% increase. Why does this matter? It shows a strong correlation between tech stock stability and crypto confidence. For investors, especially those seeking short-term trades or tokens with high upside, this kind of momentum can push smaller assets, including meme coins, into breakout territory. Key Signals in the Best Meme Coins When the market is quiet, identifying the best meme coin requires spotting early signs of movement. Here's what to look for: Unique Narrative or Utility Does the coin just ride on memes, or is there more to the story? The most promising meme coins in 2025 combine humor with utility—like access to DeFi tools or integration with real AI. A strong narrative not only grabs attention, but also helps the coin sustain interest during market dips. Coins with no clear message often fade fast. Strong Community Engagement A meme coin lives and dies by its community. Watch for active Telegrams, Twitter spaces, and organic content—it’s often the first signal of a brewing breakout. Real engagement includes user-made memes, community voting, and consistent dialogue—not just hype from the devs. The louder and more authentic the buzz, the more likely it is to translate into upward price pressure. Tokenomics That Drive Scarcity The best meme coins usually implement a capped supply, staking rewards, or burn mechanisms that help increase value over time. Scarcity works when it's paired with demand—especially during presales or exchange listings. Catalysts and Momentum Look for upcoming exchange listings, influencer interest, or new partnerships. These events often drive price jumps when interest is already brewing. Coins that consistently push updates and remain visible have a much better chance of staying relevant. When these pieces come together, meme coins can flip from quiet to explosive in hours. That’s why timing matters—and why smart investors track more than just price. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): A Meme Coin With Breakout Potential In a crowded space of coins trying to go viral, Dawgz AI is aiming higher. Built on the Ethereum network, it combines meme culture with AI-powered trading utility—a hybrid that some investors believe could position it among the top meme coins of the year. Here’s why DAGZ is showing early signs of strength: AI + Meme Culture Instead of riding trends, Dawgz AI creates its own. It integrates Blackbox AI algorithms designed to provide automated trading strategies—giving holders more than just a token to speculate on. Early Presale Success With over $3.4M raised, the project has already built a strong base of supporters. That’s a key advantage for community-driven growth. Audited for Security The smart contract was audited by SolidProof , a recognized firm, adding trust for early backers. Tokenomics With Staking Built-In 8.888B total supply 20% allocated for staking Rewards available even during presale This model rewards long-term holders and reduces sell pressure—a smart move for maintaining value. Ethereum Foundation Being an ERC-20 token means it’s easy to store, trade, and integrate across existing DeFi apps. Active Visibility Push The team is executing targeted marketing to ensure the project stays top of mind—a key move when attention spans are short. Dawgz AI could be one of those rare projects that makes its move before the rest of the meme market catches up. The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? The Apple dividend signal might seem distant from meme coin trading—but when institutional money shifts, it creates waves across all assets. Bitcoin moved. Ethereum followed. Meme coins are next in line. For those looking for the best meme coin to buy now, Dawgz AI offers a compelling mix of narrative, community, utility, and timing. While nothing is guaranteed, early signals point to DAGZ as one of the few new meme coins preparing to lead, not follow. FAQs Section Which meme coin is best to buy now? Dawgz AI is gaining traction for its mix of AI utility and meme appeal, making it one to watch closely. Which meme coin will reach $1 in 2025? It's hard to predict, but Dawgz AI's strong tokenomics and roadmap could position it for big moves if demand continues. Which meme coin will 100x? New tokens with utility and momentum, like Dawgz AI, may offer that kind of upside—though risk is always part of the equation. Which memecoin has the most potential? Dawgz AI stands out right now for combining AI trading tools with a viral-friendly community narrative. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-18T10:49:49.000Z,"Why HashFly Stands Out Among Leading Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025","Since its establishment in 2013, HashFly has consistently led the cloud mining industry by offering secure, transparent, and highly profitable Bitcoin mining services. As the cloud mining market grows and diversifies, users are faced with many choices — from Hashing24 and NiceHash to StormGain and BitFuFu. But how does HashFly truly compare, and why should it be your platform of choice? 1. Proven Track Record and Longevity HashFly ’s foundation in 2013 places it among the pioneers of cloud mining. Unlike newer platforms still building their reputation, HashFly has a decade of experience supporting over a million satisfied miners worldwide. This longevity reflects its stability, reliability, and commitment to delivering consistent results. 2. Superior Return on Investment (ROI) While many platforms offer cloud mining contracts, few can match HashFly’s high daily returns—up to 7.2%—and clear, short-term contract structures. For example, smaller contracts starting at $200 provide quick, daily profits, enabling users to reinvest or withdraw with confidence. Other platforms often feature longer contract durations with less attractive yields, making HashFly an ideal choice for investors seeking fast, tangible returns. 3. User-Friendly Experience and Instant Bonuses HashFly simplifies cloud mining with an intuitive platform and mobile app, making it accessible to both beginners and seasoned investors. Upon registration, users receive a $10 instant bonus, giving them a risk-free start to mining. By contrast, platforms like NiceHash operate as hash power marketplaces, which can be more complex for new users, while others like Hashing24 require higher minimum investments and offer fewer immediate incentives. 4. Transparent and Daily Payout System Transparency is critical in crypto mining. HashFly delivers daily payouts directly to user accounts—no delays, no hidden fees. In comparison, some platforms may have weekly or monthly payout schedules or complex fee structures, potentially limiting user cash flow. HashFly’s daily payout system empowers users with liquidity and control. 5. Responsive Customer Support Mining investments demand trust. HashFly’s 24/7 customer support ensures users receive prompt assistance whenever needed. This level of support surpasses many competitors, whose customer service can be inconsistent or limited to business hours, leaving miners uncertain during critical issues.

2025-05-18T10:45:07.000Z,"Will the Next Move in Bitcoin Prices Lead to a Record or Is a Correction on the Way? Analyst Outlines Two Price Scenarios","Ali Martinez, one of the well-known analysts of the cryptocurrency market, predicted the next move for Bitcoin (BTC) in his latest assessment. With the BTC price at a critical price threshold, Martinez first questioned whether a new all-time high or a correction would come first. According to the analyst, the BTC price has hit a key resistance area at $107,000 following a 42% rally last month. Martinez added that this level is historically a turning point. However, the analyst argued that the current momentum has become overstretched, with the RSI data on the daily chart showing BTC in overbought territory, which is a common occurrence in short-term pullbacks. Warning about the pullback, the analyst also said that BTC whales sold around 30,000 coins, which means profit taking from current levels has occurred. Related News: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Predicts BTC's Movement in the Coming Days Based on Previous Data! According to the analyst, the area between $95,850 and $98,730 will be a must-hold support area for BTC if selling pressure increases. Martinez noted that a breakout from these levels could result in a deeper correction for BTC. On the bullish side, the analyst claimed that if the Bitcoin price manages to stay above the mentioned level, it could enter a period of consolidation and gather strength for a breakout towards $116,900 as the next major target. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-18T10:40:30.000Z,"Bitcoin Solaris Turns Retail Investors Into Crypto Elites: Hedera Holders Left Behind","Hedera Hashgraph has positioned itself as an enterprise-focused distributed ledger, with governing council members from Fortune 500 companies and consensus nodes limited to approved entities. While its technology is optimized for speed and low fees, everyday users have few ways to participate meaningfully in network operations or generate yield from holding HBAR. The reward structure favors corporate stakeholders, leaving retail users without direct incentives or control. Bitcoin Solaris disrupts that model with a network designed around everyday participation. Through its Nova App, any smartphone becomes a mining node — allowing users to earn BTC-S tokens daily, with no specialized hardware, no validator applications, and no capital lock-ups. The system transforms casual users into protocol contributors and opens a direct pathway to get rich through real-time, on-chain income rather than speculative price movement. Mobile Mining: Income Without Barriers Bitcoin Solaris’s core innovation is its mobile mining model. Users download the Nova App, allocate a small portion of phone storage (1–5 GB) and background CPU, and begin earning passively. The app runs in the background, consuming minimal energy and integrating seamlessly into normal device usage. Unlike Hedera, which restricts consensus and rewards to a fixed set of enterprise validators, Bitcoin Solaris invites anyone with a smartphone to contribute and earn. Mining rewards are distributed based on device uptime and network support, meaning even those without deep technical knowledge or institutional backing can gain exposure to daily blockchain income — turning phones into financial tools for wealth accumulation. Built for Scale, Speed, and Accessibility Bitcoin Solaris operates on a dual-layer blockchain optimized for performance and decentralization: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the ledger and handle consensus without high energy costs. The Solaris Layer, built on Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT), processes transactions and mining operations at over 10,000 TPS, with 2-second finality. This structure separates transaction throughput from validator consensus, allowing the network to scale independently of centralized control. Hedera may offer high speed, but participation is reserved for enterprise gatekeepers. Bitcoin Solaris ensures speed with inclusivity — enabling protocol-level rewards for global users regardless of geography or financial status. In a recent review, Crypto Legends broke down how Bitcoin Solaris gives power to users through mining, while Hedera remains tightly controlled by council members. The video highlights accessibility, income models, and how mobile mining opens doors for everyday investors. BTC-S at 3 USDT: Smart Entry Before Demand Surges Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S tokens at 3 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated for presale participants. There is no inflation, no staking requirement, and no dilution from future minting. By securing tokens during presale, users position themselves for early access to Nova App mining, low initial difficulty rates, and first participation in validator and app-layer deployments. For those seeking to get rich through contribution rather than speculation, this stage presents a uniquely timed opportunity before public rollout and exchange listings. Get Up to 75% Extra BTC-S in Phase 3 Invest specific amounts to activate bonus rewards during this phase: Invest exactly $1,000 → Receive a 25% bonus Invest exactly $2,500 → Receive a 50% bonus Invest exactly $4,000 → Receive a 75% bonus Bonuses are valid only during Phase 3. Investing less than the required amount will not qualify. Offer ends when the phase closes. Audited for Security, Designed for the Masses Bitcoin Solaris has passed multiple independent audits confirming the reliability, fairness, and scalability of its infrastructure: Cyberscope Audit : Assessed smart contracts, mobile mining structure, and token emission Freshcoins Audit : Reviewed consensus logic and cross-layer interaction integrity KYC Verification : Verified development team identity and governance oversight These verifications ensure that participation is secure, transparent, and immune to the opaque control models used by legacy projects. Hedera may serve institutions — but Bitcoin Solaris serves everyone. Through daily mobile mining, decentralized reward distribution, and presale access at just 3 USDT, it empowers users to get rich by participating in the network itself. As more retail investors leave passive ecosystems behind, Bitcoin Solaris is becoming the foundation for a new kind of crypto elite — one built from the ground up, phone by phone.

2025-05-18T10:06:01.000Z,"AFP seizes Bitcoin, luxury car, and mansion in connection with cybercrime probe","The Australian Federal Police (AFP) have seized luxury assets linked to a hacker who was convicted of cybercrime offenses. According to reports, authorities seized assets worth $4.5 million, including a beachfront mansion, luxury cars, and Bitcoin, from the convicted individual. According to reports, the individual, 32-year-old Shane Duffy, from Queensland, saw millions worth of those assets seized after a lengthy investigation into his illegal activities. He was apprehended on charges of stealing digital assets and cyber hacking. The authorities seized Duffy’s beachfront home back in April. In addition, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) of the AFP also seized a 2019 black Mercedes-Benz sedan and about 25 Bitcoins. AFP seizes assets worth $4.5 million from hacker According to reports, Duffy was suspected of carrying out the theft of about 950 bitcoins from a French crypto exchange in 2013. The assets are now worth about $150 million. Before then, he had been convicted of hacking Riot Games, the US company behind the popular video game League of Legends. In 2018, the CACT initiated an investigation after AUSTRAC was alerted to the development by authorities in Luxembourg about his suspicious bitcoin transactions. However, the authorities have yet to bring up criminal charges in connection with the alleged theft. Meanwhile, they have been able to halt the suspected proceeds of the alleged crime under federal laws, even without a prosecution. Authorities were able to secure the restraining order for the assets obtained in 2019, and they were subsequently forfeited in April. According to the AFP, the assets include a waterfront mansion in Beachmere, Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, which was purchased at about $1.1 million, and is now estimated to be worth about $2 million. The authorities added that the property was held in the suspect’s mother’s name. CACT has seized criminal assets worth $1.2 billion After the sale of the seized properties, the proceeds are expected to be transferred into a special fund that assists crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives. The AFP says it is still committed to confiscating alleged proceeds to disrupt the activities of criminals and cybercrime. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy highlighted the law backing the seizure. “The Proceeds of Crime Act provides law enforcement agencies with unique powers to restrain and forfeit instruments and proceeds of crime,” he said. He added that criminals are driven by greed, and unfortunately it is law-abiding Australians and businesses who end up losing their hard-earned money to these cybercriminals. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community,” he said. According to reports, the CACT has seized criminal assets worth over $1.2 billion since 2019. These assets include houses, cars, fine art, luxury items, and digital assets. According to court documents obtained by the media, Duffy allegedly accumulated more than $32,000 in 2013 through the sale of access to inactive League of Legends accounts. The suspect was said to have hacked the X account of Riot Games president Marc Merrill to promote the illegal operation and allegedly partnered with another hacker to disrupt matches on the platform by disconnecting players. Riot Games mentioned the hack resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2016, Duffy was sentenced to two-and-half years in prison, a term he served after pleading guilty in Brisbane District Court.

2025-05-18T10:00:16.000Z,"Ethereum Price Struggles To Hold Above $2,500 — Watch Out For This Support Level","The Ethereum price performance in the month of May has been nothing short of outstanding, surging by more than 35% in the past two weeks. After making a strong run toward the $2,700 mark on Tuesday, May 13, the altcoin’s price has struggled to build on its momentum over the past few days. The price of ETH did manage to stay above the $2,500 mark over the past week, bouncing back from the psychological level on Thursday, May 15. However, the recent struggles seem to have compounded over the weekend, with the Ethereum price losing the $2,500 level to end the week. The Next Support Cushion For ETH Price Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an interesting on-chain outlook on the price of Ethereum and its latest lack of bullish momentum. Following the dip of ETH beneath the $2,500 mark, the online pundit has identified the altcoin’s next significant support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Market Signals Further Upside Potential For BTC Price: New ATH Soon? This evaluation revolves around the average cost basis of several Ethereum investors. Cost-basis analysis basically measures the ability of a price level to act as support or resistance — based on the total amount of coins last purchased by investors at this level. As shown in the chart above, the size of the circles directly corresponds with the quantity of ETH tokens bought within each price zone and the region’s significance as support or resistance. In essence, the bigger the dot, the higher the number of tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots represent resistance (as they are above the asset price). Data provided by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that the Ethereum price has key support around the $2,354 – $2,430 zone, where 2.64 million addresses purchased 63.9 million tokens (worth $153.04 billion at an average price of $2,395). As Martinez highlighted, this price bracket would serve as an on-chain cushion for the ETH price, as investors with their cost bases around the level would likely defend their positions by buying more tokens if the price falls toward $2,400. The fresh buying pressure around this price region would help counter the downward pressure, thereby keeping the Ethereum price afloat. The highlighted chart shows that it is all clear blue skies for the price of Ethereum, with no significant resistance lying ahead. However, the altcoin will need to hold above the $2,400 level, or it risks falling to as low as $2,200. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,480, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive. Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily. According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin ( BTC )’s role as a monetary protocol. “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote , arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data. Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools. Source: Adam Back Related: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overview Ammous compares Bitcoin spam to email Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system. “It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions. “So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added. The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy. Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems. Source: Saifedean Ammous The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder. In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages. Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

After hitting $74,652 earlier this year, BTC has made a V-shaped recovery and is now above $104,000 and heading towards $109,427. This technical pattern – sharp declines followed by sharp rebounds – is a sign of strong market conviction and often precedes big rallies. Since breaking above the 50-day EMA ($94,870), Bitcoin has been in a steep trend with higher lows and accumulation. Bitcoin's V-Shaped Recovery is Complete From $74K lows to $104K highs, BTC has staged a textbook V-shaped reversal—fast fall, faster rebound. Bulls now eye $109K… and beyond. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #VShapeRecovery #CryptoTrading pic.twitter.com/idFi5AFsAq — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 18, 2025 Despite some caution in the momentum indicators, especially the MACD showing decreasing bullish volume, price structure is good. This rebound also comes with institutional flows and broader crypto market optimism.

On the 1-hour chart, BTC is coiling in a symmetrical triangle – an indecision zone that often precedes big breakouts. At $104,007, the price is pressing against the triangle’s upper resistance and horizontal barrier at $104,550. Technically, Bitcoin is looking good beneath the surface. The MACD has turned green, the 50-period EMA ($103,421) is holding as support and recent candles are showing increasing buying pressure and higher lows. If bulls can confirm a breakout with a strong 1-hour candle above $104,550, BTC could quickly go to $105,668 and possibly $106,685. But if it doesn’t break out cleanly, it could go back to $103,000 or $102,700 before the next attempt. Bitcoin Price Chart (symmetrical triangle pattern) – Source: Tradingview $120K in Sight for Bitcoin? Macro Momentum Building With Bitcoin’s V-shaped recovery and technical pressure building, eyes are now on $120,000 – a psychological and Fibonacci extension target if BTC clears $109K cleanly. Short-term resistance needs to be respected but long-term sentiment is getting bullish. The broader setup is also bullish: Whale accumulation is increasing, according to on-chain data ETF inflows are strong Institutional sentiment is shifting from cautious to opportunistic Conclusion Bitcoin is looking good on both daily and 1-hour charts. Technicals are in place and sentiment is improving. $120K is not out of reach if bulls can get above $104,550. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols.

Many altcoins have marked more substantial gains in the past day, but most of them are reps of the ever-volatile meme coin niche. BTC Consolidation Phase Endures Bitcoin began the business week with some enhanced volatility following the trade deal struck between the US and China. At first, the cryptocurrency shot up to a multi-month peak of almost $106,000 before the bears took brief control of the market and drove it south to under $101,000 hours later. Nevertheless, the predominantly bullish sentiment prevailed and bitcoin remained within six-digit price territory. Moreover, it bounced off and spiked to $105,000 a day later where it found another rejection. The price moves repeated in a smaller extent but BTC overall managed to remain above $103,000. It slipped below that lower boundary yesterday, but that was also short-lived and now sits around $104,000. This has pushed its market capitalization to over $2.060 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has retraced slightly since yesterday, but is still above 60%. Yet, this hasn’t stopped many analysts from speculating that the altseason has started. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Memes Rebound Most altcoins have bounced off after yesterday’s nosedive. Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,500 level after a 2% daily increase, while XRP has neared $2.4 following a similar jump. More impressive daily pumps come from SOL, TRX, AVAX, and LINK. However, the meme coins lead in terms of daily gains. The largest of the bunch has soared by 5% to $0.22 while SHIB is up by 5.5% and sits above $0.000015. Even bigger gains come from the likes of WIF (11%), Fartcoin (9%), BONK (8%), and FLOKI (8%). PI has found a place somewhere between them with a 9% daily increase.

In a report submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 14th, the digital asset exchange says that hackers bribed its customer service representatives to gain access to client information and internal Coinbase records. The compromised information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, government ID images and more.

The leaked information includes his phone number, address and data linked with his Coinbase account. Botha, who is currently serving as managing partner at Sequoia Capital, is a venture capitalist who has made early bets on iconic companies, including YouTube and Instagram, since joining the California-based firm in 2003. Botha and Sequoia Capital declined to give comments on the issue. Coinbase says the perpetrators asked for $20 million in exchange for keeping the stolen information under wraps, but the company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong vows to pay back affected customers, revamp cybersecurity protocols and relocate certain overseas customer support operations.

After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 225 Ether ( ETH ) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings. He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access. After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet. He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman’s crypto holdings were gone. Crypto scammers impersonate Coinbase support.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated over 80 million ADA in the past 48 hours. This surge in large-scale buying activity points to growing confidence among big players, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Whales often lead major market moves, and their renewed interest in Cardano may be signaling a sustained rally ahead. However, the $0.90 level now acts as a near-term resistance, and reclaiming it will be essential to unlock higher targets. The coming days are likely to be pivotal for ADA’s price structure. If bulls manage to flip this level, the next leg up could bring Cardano back into the spotlight—possibly reigniting broader altcoin enthusiasm in the process. Whale Accumulation Signals Strength: Buyers Push For A Breakout Despite this impressive rebound, ADA remains 43% below its December 2024 highs around $1.32. This gap highlights the cautious optimism that dominates the altcoin landscape. While bulls are gradually regaining control, overall market fear and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to pressure altcoins, many of which are still struggling to push through key resistance levels. ADA is currently consolidating just above the $0.74 level, forming a base that could precede a breakout. Market structure is tightening, and the next move—upward or downward- will likely be sharp. A decisive push above $0.90 would confirm a breakout and likely trigger renewed interest from retail and institutional investors. Fueling this narrative is fresh data from top analyst Ali Martinez, who reported that whales have purchased over 80 million ADA in the last 48 hours. This large-scale accumulation points to increasing confidence among big players and could act as a catalyst for further upside. Whale activity often precedes strong price action, and this development supports the idea that ADA may be on the verge of a significant move. As ADA consolidates near critical support and whale interest grows, market watchers are closely monitoring for signs of continuation. If bulls maintain momentum and break past resistance, Cardano could quickly shift from a consolidation phase to a full-scale rally, potentially reigniting momentum across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Resistance Against Bitcoin – ETH/BTC Bullish Structure In Question Cardano Holds Crucial Support As Bulls Aim For Recovery Cardano is currently trading around $0.74, testing a key support zone after failing to hold above the $0.80 mark. The chart shows a strong surge earlier in May that brought ADA to local highs near $0.90, but since then, the price has retraced and is now consolidating just above its 200-day EMA (around $0.71). This level is acting as dynamic support and could be critical for the next move. The price structure suggests ADA is in a decisive phase. A breakdown below the EMA and the horizontal support around $0.72 could expose the token to a deeper retracement toward previous consolidation zones. On the other hand, reclaiming $0.80 would invalidate the bearish scenario and signal a potential push toward $0.90 and eventually $1.00—an area that marks strong historical resistance. Volume has declined slightly during the recent pullback, suggesting the retracement may be driven more by profit-taking than panic selling. The 200 SMA above at $0.80 remains a key target to watch for bullish continuation.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet.He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process.

The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course.However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness.The new rule is part of the UK’s integration of the Organisation for Economic Development’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting.The changes reflect the UK government’s aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection.Related: Bitwise lists four crypto ETPs on London Stock ExchangeUK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud.“Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time.A study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021.UK’s approach contrasts with EU’s MiCAThe UK’s move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union’s approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year.According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register.There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU’s approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.Source: MiCA Crypto AllianceMagazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-to-mandate-crypto-reporting-on-all-customer-transactions-in-2026?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route.

Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit.

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit.

CoinShares analyst Satish Patel predicted the growing interest in Bitcoin yield in December, noting that more investors now see BTC “not only as a store of value but also as a means to generate yields.”While there are many ways to generate Bitcoin yield, such as leveraging derivatives or yield farming, Michael Saylor’s Strategy introduced its own “BTC Yield” metric to measure the performance of its investment strategy.Strategy’s BTC Yield, which measures how much additional Bitcoin it’s acquiring relative to its outstanding shares, is currently 15.5% year-to-date, according to the company. Magazine: Metric signals $250K Bitcoin is ‘best case,’ SOL, HYPE tipped for gains: Trade Secrets",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solv-rwa-backed-bitcoin-yield-avalanche?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

Court filings showed he earned roughly $50,000 through SIM swap attacks like the one that compromised the SEC’s X account — funds likely subject to forfeiture.Related: Coinbase faces $400M bill after insider phishing attackMagazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky WeeThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-sec-hacker-eric-council?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

Her departure will come a day after Commissioner Summer Mersinger is expected to step down to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO.“It has been a tremendous honor to conclude my 23 years of federal service at an agency with such an important mission to ensure that financial markets perform their critical role in the US and global economies,” said Romero.Romero and Mersinger’s upcoming departures would leave the CFTC with only two Senate-confirmed members: acting chair Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson, each taking one Republican and Democratic seat, respectively. However, Pham also announced that she planned to leave after Quintenz’s confirmation. The shakeup in leadership potentially gives President Donald Trump the opportunity to pick three more commissioners after the Senate addresses Quintenz’s nomination.Related: Former CFTC lawyer says agency should take lead on memecoin regulationsAssuming Quintenz, likely being positioned for one of the CFTC’s Republican seats, is confirmed, Trump would still be able to radically change the leadership of the commission by choosing four of the five-member panel.

The bill is expected to clarify oversight and enforcement authority of the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over many cryptocurrencies.During her time at the commission, starting in 2022, Romero helped establish the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee, in part in response to addressing regulatory concerns from the crypto industry.

It has vastly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index and broader US stock market over that period.The Nvidia revelations overshadowed CoreWeave’s fiscal first-quarter earnings report, which showed a 420% surge in revenue but also a 487% spike in operating expenses. The company’s net loss widened by 143% compared to a year earlier. Its stock declined shortly after the financials were released on May 14. CoreWeave’s fiscal first quarter earnings results.

The company began transitioning away from digital assets the following year after the onset of the bear market.By 2019, it had rebranded to CoreWeave and began leveraging its GPU infrastructure to provide cloud computing services. The company then rode out the AI boom and its unique relationship with Nvidia to secure a massive IPO launch. CoreWeave has landed other major investors, with Cointelegraph reporting in March that OpenAI reached an $11.9 billion deal with the company to supply AI infrastructure for the ChatGPT developer’s massive data needs. CoreWeave is operating in a much broader cloud computing industry, which is forecast to become a $2 trillion behemoth by 2030 as AI applications gain mainstream adoption, according to Goldman Sachs. Cloud computing’s total addressable market by 2030.

2025-05-16T15:00:00.000Z,"From debanking to a banking arms race—The rise of stablecoins","Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin PayrollThere are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. It is imperative that the banking industry stop shunning crypto and start — at least understanding it — to stay competitive. How stablecoins are deployed will separate the banking winners and losers. From debanking to stablecoins Of course, stablecoins are not a new concept. For years, large institutions like JPMorgan and Santander have experimented with stablecoins and blockchains. Those experiments were around small functions like internal treasury reconciliation and interbank settlement. Much of this was also on private blockchains created by those banks. Implementing digital dollars on private chains, however, misses out on the core innovation of stablecoins.While the use case of stablecoins for international remittances is clear, we are just scratching the surface of the power of stablecoins on public networks. For example, stablecoins eradicate unauthorized payment disputes and enable far faster pay cycles. Payroll payments are also complex. Payday is a web of thousands of automated clearing houses, wires, comma-separated values and PDFs. The programmability of stablecoins enables companies to create efficiency among all these data structures, processing times, reconciliations and paycheck reporting. Many smaller banks are just now waking up to the opportunity to incorporate permissionless, public network stablecoins into their workflows. Similar to how many businesses started to investigate how AI might change their businesses with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, so too are banks needing to look at how stablecoins will upend money movement. Recently, Custodia Bank issued its own stablecoin, Avit, on Ethereum. Custodia’s users can access quick, cheap banking services that are hard to beat. This is an excellent example of implementation for other financial institutions to follow.Stablecoin adoption is increasing as the tech keeps improvingActive stablecoin wallets increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to over 30 million in February 2025, according to Artemis and Dune. US President Donald Trump hopes to have stablecoin legislation on his desk by August 2025. Wyoming already did so in late March 2025.Recent: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsStablecoin infrastructure has improved significantly, and there is increased confidence in the security of stablecoins. 91% of the supply of stablecoins is fiat-backed, and only 8.5% are backed by collateralized crypto assets. Riskier algorithmic stablecoins have gone out of vogue.Incremental changes also make it easier for non-crypto businesses to use stablecoins. There are now simple solutions for many of the original UX problems with stablecoins.Additionally, more assets are moving onchain. Using stablecoins on public networks like Ethereum, payment companies will be better prepared to serve the future financial system. It’s not just stablecoins that are updating the financial system, either. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Squawk Box he wants the SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks.”For banks looking for a competitive advantage in a world of powerful fintechs, shifting interest rates and lower consumer savings, using the power of stablecoins to improve their products and their internal operations might be the most powerful decision they make. Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin Payroll.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-16T14:30:00.000Z,"Europe’s MiCA law is motion, but can the crypto industry keep up?","The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines approaching, firms are being forced to act quickly.Stablecoins at bayOne of MiCA’s earliest and most controversial provisions involves stablecoins. Under the law, no stablecoin can be offered to EU users unless the issuer is authorized in the EU and publishes a regulator-approved white paper.Strict rules around asset reserves, governance, conflict of interest and marketing are also part of the package. Issuers are even banned from offering interest on tokens, removing a common incentive for adoption.Related: Stablecoin regulation next ‘catalyst’ for crypto industry — Aptos headThe world’s most-used stablecoin — Tether’s USDt (USDT) — has already announced it won’t seek MiCA compliance, meaning exchanges may soon be forced to delist it across the EU. This has major implications for liquidity, retail access and DeFi activity in the region.Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson at Token 2049:“The reason is not, uh, fear of regulations, fear of compliance… The problem that I had with um, with MiCA is that [the] license is very dangerous when it comes to stablecoins and I believe that it's even more dangerous for the small medium banking system in Europe.”Compliance is keyOn the flip side, other firms are leaning in. BitGo, a crypto custody firm, recently secured a MiCA-aligned license in Germany, positioning itself to serve institutional players across Europe. Brett Reeves, head of Go Network and European Sales at BitGo, told Cointelegraph the license is not just about compliance, but long-term strategic alignment with Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape.“We found that both BaFin and the European regulators have been relatively straightforward to deal with. Sometimes they have difficult questions, but they're there to make sure that our processes are in place and up to scratch.”We also spoke with Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, who emphasized the need for consistent national-level interpretation and better guidance from regulators to prevent fragmentation.Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-16T14:22:30.000Z,"Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors","As cryptocurrency gains in popularity and price, some criminals are taking to violent measures to steal funds from high-profile crypto holders.Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high-profile attacks this year.Ledger founder and wife kidnapped, freedThe founder of crypto wallet Ledger, David Balland, and his wife, Amandine Balland, were kidnapped from their home on Jan. 21. The couple was put in a car, then separated and held at different locations. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the kidnappers called an executive at Ledger and demanded a substantial ransom to be paid in cryptocurrencies. They reportedly mutilated Balland’s hand and sent Ledger a photograph to put pressure on the company.Some 230 officers participated in the search after Ledger alerted authorities. The police managed to locate and free David on Jan. 22 in Châteauroux, 30 miles southwest of his residence. One day later, after questioning arrested suspects and analyzing phone records, police were able to locate and rescue Amandine in Étampes, 80 miles north of Vierzon.A small portion of the ransom was paid. Beccuau said it was frozen and tracked, leading to the arrest of nine men and one woman. Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier released a statement after Balland was rescued. Source: Pascal GauthierLambo sale goes wrong for Korean Bitcoin traderOn Jan. 20, Korean Bitcoin (BTC) trader Taehwa Kim met with a man under the alias “JC” in Makati City, Philippines who was supposedly interested in buying his Lamborghini. After a test drive, they stopped at a spa, supposedly to meet with JC’s lawyer. Three other men forced Kim into another vehicle and bound his hands. Kim was kept for three days. Then, the attackers abandoned him some 50 kilometers away, his hands still tied, where police officers found him.The perpetrators didn’t manage to get his crypto, but they stole his car, his Rolex watch, his wallet and the keys to his house. Streamer shoots would-be crypto thievesIn November 2024, Kick streamer and cosplayer Kaitlyn Siragusa, known professionally as “Amouranth,” posted a screenshot on X of her crypto wallet. It held some $20 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Months later, on March 2, 2025, three armed assailants allegedly broke into her home with the intent of stealing her cryptocurrency. She posted during the incident on X, stating, “I’m being too robbed at gunpont. I believe I shot one of them they wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed.”Siragusa claimed that the assailants physically assaulted her before she discharged a weapon, after which they fled the scene. She said that police were testing blood left by suspects at the scene and posted video of the incident on her X profile. Kidnappers demand $50 million in crypto from Spanish businessmanOn March 29, police in São Paulo arrested a retired military police officer in connection with the week-long kidnapping of a Spanish businessman. Speaking to authorities, the businessman said he was approached by two men dressed in fake civil police uniforms and forced into a truck. Upon reaching a secluded location on the outskirts of the city, the assailants held him and demanded $50 million in cryptocurrency.Local media said the kidnappers drugged their victim with sleeping pills, but he was still able to escape when one of them went to the bathroom. After finding a filling station, he tipped off police, who seized one of the suspects as well as a pistol and ammunition. Daughter of crypto exchange owner fights off assailants The daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Paris when passersby intervened.Three masked attackers tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a van while they were taking a walk in Paris on May 13. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

The assailants fled in a van, which was later found abandoned nearby. The victims sustained injuries and were evacuated to a local hospital. Local media reported that the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior, was investigating the incident. Assailants target father of crypto entrepreneurKidnappers in Paris, France abducted the father of a French cryptocurrency entrepreneur on May 4. The attackers took him to Essonne, 35 miles away from the Paris street where they grabbed him, and cut off his finger. They made a video and sent it to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. The victim’s son subsequently contacted police. The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Authorities have noted the striking similarities of the case to that of Balland, whose attackers also took him several miles from the city and mutilated his hand. “Obviously, there’s at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it’s the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde.Authorities seek answers and crypto holders want securityThe rise in recent attacks has shaken the crypto industry. Ben Davis, co-founder and CEO at blockchain insurance firm Native, told Cointelegraph, “We used to see crypto wrench attacks predominantly happening when executives were abroad or traveling. However, high-profile cases like the kidnapping of Ledger’s co-founder show that attackers are now targeting individuals in their own homes, with more planning and precision than ever before.”Authorities are responding to concerns as well. On May 16, the French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with cryptocurrency professionals to address the recent uptick in violent crime against industry figures. For the foreseeable future, personal security, not just asset security, will be a defining theme of the crypto industry. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky WeeAdditional reporting by Cath Jenkin",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",

The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.Source: Stuart AlderotyAlderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”Why did the court refuse to grant the ruling?According to the court document, Torres denied the motion as “procedurally improper” since the SEC and Ripple failed to file the correct procedural motion to support the proposed settlement.“By styling their motion as one for ‘settlement approval,’ the parties fail to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty,” the Judge wrote.An excerpt from the court’s rejection of the SEC-Ripple motion on May 15, 2025.

2025-05-16T13:55:35.000Z,"The emergence of Sonic and what it means for DeFi: Report","Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.  Download a full version of the report for free hereSonic’s technical architectureSonic runs on the proprietary SonicVM execution engine, which dynamically translates EVM bytecode into a faster internal format for speedier execution. It also optimizes heavy computations to prevent repeated work and pre-analyzes contract code to cache valid jump destinations. The SonicVM is fully compatible with the EVM, meaning that Fantom smart contracts can run seamlessly on the new blockchain.To address the issue of hefty onchain data storage and slow node synchronization, Sonic uses a new database design called SonicDB. SonicDB separates the blockchain state into two databases. It uses the LiveDB for fast access to the current state and execution, and the ArchiveDB for storing full historical data. This separation allows consensus nodes to cut data storage requirements by up to 90% and thus significantly reduces hardware requirements and synchronization time.For a more comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of Sonic, download the full report for free here. Introducing the S tokenThe Sonic mainnet is powered by a new native token, S. Holders of FTM can convert their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio using the official portal. S remains non-inflationary over the first six months following the mainnet launch in December 2024. Then, 6% of the initial supply will be minted to reward the early users of the blockchain. The full report offers in-depth coverage of several capital-efficient airdrop farming strategies with different risk profiles. Sonic rewards developers as well via its Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) mechanism. Up to 90% of the transaction fees across participating applications are forwarded to developers, while the rest is routed to validators.Becoming a new hub for DeFiAndre Cronje, one of the founders of Fantom and the mastermind behind the Yearn.finance protocol is spearheading DeFi innovation on Sonic. Cronje unveiled Flying Tulip, a new DeFi platform that combines trading, liquidity pools and lending functionalities. The report discusses some innovations Flying Tulip brings to the Sonic blockchain.Flying Tulip is based on the same concept as Curve v2’s dynamic bonding curve. An AMM with a dynamic bonding curve adjusts its curvature based on how close the pool price is to an external price observed by an oracle. It also automatically concentrates the liquidity around the current price, simplifying liquidity management and enhancing capital efficiency. Flying Tulip introduces even faster equilibrium curve updates and narrower ranges alongside other improvements with a novel dynamic loan-to-value model.

2025-05-16T13:29:56.000Z,"51% attack on Ethereum more difficult than on Bitcoin — Justin Drake","Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that he believes it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and he expects a successful attack to be “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network’s mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:“This will become blindingly obvious over the next decade. ETH is the only truly decentralized crypto-asset that can become the internet's [store of value].“Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacksEthereum attack would cost much moreDrake explained that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:“A rich nation state can probably pull it off.“At the time of writing, there was 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.Staked Ether chart. Source: BeaconCha.inStill, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinEthereum’s last line of defenseMatan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.“Ethereum’s ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community’s powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.Drake also highlighted another advantage that he believes Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” “This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.Drake’s statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network’s human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin’s simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-proponent-claims-bitcoin-is-screwed-a-51-attack-likely?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",
