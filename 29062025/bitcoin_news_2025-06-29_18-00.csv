2025-06-29T16:21:23,"Texas is going Bitcoin: 3 tokens to stack as U.S. states embrace BTC reserves","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Texas funds $10m Bitcoin reserve, setting stage for altcoin surge as ETF hopes and investor momentum grow. The Lone Star State just put its stamp on the future of finance. Texas has officially become the first U.S. state to authorize and actively fund a publicly managed Bitcoin reserve, thanks to the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott. With $10 million allocated toward purchasing Bitcoin for the state treasury, the move is more than symbolic; it signals a broader institutional shift in how governments perceive and use digital assets. But here’s the real opportunity: Bitcoin’s rise is opening the door for several other cryptocurrencies to follow in its institutional footsteps, especially as ETF approval odds skyrocket for assets like Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP. Behind the scenes, regulatory clarity is catching up, and analysts are calling this the next major green light for the altcoin market. For investors looking to front-run the next leg up, three standout tokens are gaining serious momentum, including a surprise meme-chain play under $0.002 that could eclipse them all. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Little Pepe: The memecoin building a blockchain movement Texas may be going all in on Bitcoin, but forward-thinking investors are zeroing in on a radically different project with explosive upside: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Currently in Stage 3 of its presale at just $0.0012, LILPEPE isn’t just another frog-faced memecoin. It’s a fully engineered Layer 2 blockchain, explicitly built for memecoins, focusing on speed, scalability, and anti-bot security. As memecoins continue to dominate retail attention, LILPEPE is creating the rails they’ll run on and positioning itself as the Solana of meme tokens. Why it stands out: Zero tax and near-zero fees Sniper bot protection — a first in meme token design Dedicated memecoin launchpad Tokenomics built for long-term scale: 26.5% Presale 30% Chain Reserves 13.5% Staking 10% Liquidity 10% Marketing 10% DEX Listings Unlike most low-cap memecoins, LILPEPE is confirmed for two Tier-1 CEX listings at launch, with rumors circulating about a possible deal with the world’s largest crypto exchange. Add a $777,000 presale giveaway (10 winners will receive $77,000 in LILPEPE each), and we have one of the most anticipated altcoins of the year. Solana: Regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand Solana’s inclusion in ETF filings isn’t just a nod to its strong performance — it’s recognition of its maturing role in the crypto ecosystem. The SEC’s engagement with filings for a Solana ETF, with a final deadline set for October 10, 2025, suggests that the agency views SOL as a potential commodity, especially given that CFTC-regulated Solana futures are already trading. Analysts estimate a 95% chance of ETF approval, fueling renewed demand from institutional investors. Solana has already recovered from the FTX fallout and established itself as the backbone for multiple high-velocity applications, from DeFi and NFTs to on-chain games and social platforms like Dialect and DRiP. If the ETF gets the green light, SOL could see Bitcoin-level inflows from traditional finance players looking to diversify exposure without venturing too far from the blue-chip space. XRP: A regulatory favorite with ETF momentum XRP’s journey through the legal gauntlet has made it one of the best-positioned digital assets for regulatory clarity. The SEC said on January 30, 2025, that it had received a request for a spot XRP ETF. Big names, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, are supporting it. Analysts expect almost specific approval because the final decision is due on October 17, 2025. Why the optimism? Regulators already view XRP as a commodity. It has CFTC-regulated futures contracts in place. A strong global remittance use case supports its real-world value. As Texas pioneers a Bitcoin reserve, states and municipalities will eventually seek diversified crypto treasuries. XRP, with its institutional-grade infrastructure and fast settlement system, is likely to be included. The bigger picture: Why states like Texas are setting the tone Texas isn’t alone. States like Arizona and New Hampshire have passed similar legislation, and many more are watching closely. What’s different about Texas is that it’s funding the reserve, showing commitment far beyond the performative level. And as Bitcoin ETFs normalize crypto exposure, it’s only a matter of time before states begin exploring other asset-backed reserves. This is where tokens like Solana, XRP, and LILPEPE come in. SOL brings scalability and developer activity. XRP offers remittance utility and legal clarity. LILPEPE taps into cultural energy while building its infrastructure, making it the highest-risk, highest-reward play of the three. Final thoughts: A portfolio strategy for the state-backed crypto era As regulations become clearer and more states adopt cryptocurrencies, the rules for both retail and institutional investors are changing. It’s no longer enough just to hold Bitcoin or Ethereum; investors need to find the next level of fundamental assets. Solana is a scalable smart contract platform. XRP is the compliance-first remittance tool. Little Pepe is the chain built for meme virality, web3 culture, and viral user onboarding. As Texas and others begin to normalize crypto treasuries, demand for high-conviction altcoins is expected to surge. For those willing to take action before the next leg up, now could be the time to stack before the rest of the country catches on.

2025-06-29T16:08:06,"Wall Street Firms Add 5,898 Bitcoin Units to Their Corporate Treasuries","The demand for Bitcoin (BTC) among institutional clients can be inferred from the volume of the coin that was recently acquired. Reports indicate that several companies made significant announcements between June 23 and June 27 regarding the acquisition of BTC. Growing Acceptance and Adoption of Bitcoin All of a sudden, the BTC treasury market is gaining significant traction, with top traditional financial companies seeking to take a slice of the cryptocurrency. Between June 23 and June 27, nine new companies stepped into the spotlight for adding BTC to their corporate treasuries. This includes Canada-based Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, ProCap, and Sixty Six Capital. Together, these companies purchased a total of 5,898 BTC, indicating growing confidence in BTC among corporations and funds. The major buy was made by ProCap, which purchased 4,932 BTC following a successful fundraiser that generated $750 million. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation purchased 771.37 BTC, Bitcoin Treasury Capital 147 BTC, and Sixty Six Capital Inc. made a smaller purchase of 18.2 BTC. India May Explore the Possibility of a BTC Treasury Apart from those who have already made a BTC purchase, there is another group considering adding the flagship cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries in the future. It is no longer news that the United States has established its Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) valued at over $20 billion. Texas has signed the Bitcoin Reserve bill into law, with $10 million already allocated to the cause. Similarly, some governments are also mulling the idea of establishing their Bitcoin treasury amidst increasing demand. Recently, Pradeep Bhandari, a spokesperson for India’s ruling party, voiced his opinion about India exploring the idea of having its own BTC Reserve. Should the Asian country make such a move, Bhandari thinks it will be keeping pace with global changes. Bitcoin Gives Holders Financial Control The growing popularity and adoption of Bitcoin come from the perceived prospects of the coin and its future performance. Several entities are drawn to the financial control that the top crypto asset offers. During the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held in Washington, D.C., HRF’s Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, discussed the role of BTC in protecting citizens against oppressive regimes. Gladstein explained that the fact that governments are not able to track BTC makes it difficult for them to freeze or seize funds. Oftentimes, the industry has seen authoritarian regimes leverage this common tactic to control their populations.

2025-06-29T16:00:25,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2 Billion Inflows As Institutional Demand Surges – Details","The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin’s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Bitcoin ETFs On Impressive 14-Day Positive Streak Despite Market Uncertainty On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs’ positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market’s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares’ ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million – $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin’s price appreciation prospects. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel – Next Move Could Be Parabolic Ethereum ETFs Log $283 Million In Deposit To Close Out H1 2025 In other developments, SoSoValue data also reveals that US Ethereum Spot ETFs notched up a cumulative inflow of $283.41 million over the last week extending their positive streak to seven consecutive weeks. In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,441 with Bitcoin prices set around $107,339.

2025-06-29T15:45:18,"Wells Fargo Refuses To Reimburse Disabled Customer After $6,805 Drained From Bank Account: Report","The banking giant Wells Fargo is reportedly refusing to reimburse a disabled customer who lost thousands of dollars to scammers who impersonated bank employees. 52-year-old Paul Schendel, a diabetic man who was disabled due to a back injury, lost $6,805 to scammers posing as Wells Fargo employees, reports the local news station FOX 26. Schendel received a phone call one day from a number that showed up as Wells Fargo on the caller ID. The caller, who had specific knowledge of his banking details, told him that fraudulent activity had been detected on his Wells Fargo account. Later that day, a woman came to his door, cut up his bank card and took the pieces with her, including the chip. The woman even told Schendel that he should go to the bank the next day to get a new card. But when Schendel went to Wells Fargo, he was informed that the bank would never conduct such activities or ever call customers, and that the funds in his account would likely never be recovered. Schendel eventually got a letter from Wells Fargo confirming that the bank would not reimburse his losses. Says Wells Fargo, “We have completed our research of your inquiry about the charges of $6,805 on your account… Based on the information available to us, and because the transactions were made using your card and Personal Identification Number (PIN), we found it was made by you or someone who had your permission. Please consider your claim closed.” FOX26 says it reached out to Wells Fargo to learn about Schendel’s case, but has not yet received any word from the banking giant.

2025-06-29T15:31:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Can ETF Demand Power BTC To A New All-Time High?","Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stationary over the past 24 hours, holding above $107,000 to trade around $107,350. However, ETF demand and Fed policy cues could significantly dictate price action in the near term. BTC started the week with price swings and high volatility, as it fell below $100,000 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 on Monday. Mid-Tier Investors Drive Activity An analysis by CryptoQuant contributor “Oinonen” has revealed a sharp jump in whale-level and mid-tier investors driving wallet activity on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The analyst revealed that inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallets are generally controlled by high-net-worth individuals or mid-sized institutions. Whale-level inflows make up 20% of the total inflows, suggesting that mid-tier investors are driving exchange activity. However, whale activity has also peaked in recent sessions. Bitcoin inflows of 10,000 BTC surged on June 16, making up 83% of total exchange inflows on the day, reinforcing earlier observations about increased whale activity over the past year. Binance’s overall deposit metrics also indicate a growing trend of larger average deposits rising from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC . Most Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Not Survive Death Spiral According to a report by VC firm Breed, only a few Bitcoin treasury companies can avoid the “death spiral” that could impact BTC holding companies trading close to the net asset value (NAV). According to the report, the health of Bitcoin treasury companies depends on their ability to command a multiple of their net asset value (MNAV). The report outlined a seven-phase decline of Bitcoin treasury companies, starting with a drop in the Bitcoin price, driving the company’s share price close to its actual NAV. This makes it harder for the companies to secure debt and equity financing critical to the asymmetric trade of converting the US dollar into a supply-capped appreciating asset. As credit access dries up and debt maturity looms, margin calls could be triggered, forcing the companies to sell BTC in the market and lowering the asset price. This could cause a consolidation of holding companies to be acquired by stronger firms, potentially triggering a market-wide downturn. The report stated, “Ultimately, only a select few companies will sustain a lasting MNAV premium. They will earn it through strong leadership, disciplined execution, savvy marketing, and distinctive strategies that continue to grow Bitcoin-per-share regardless of broader market fluctuations.” A death spiral could trigger the next crypto bear market. However, the report stated that most Bitcoin treasury companies finance their purchases with equity instead of debt, mitigating potential impacts to a certain extent. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $107,000 over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading at $107,681. Market watchers expect price action to pick up in the next week, potentially rising to new all-time highs. Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicted that Bitcoin is displaying an extremely bullish setup that could push it to a new all-time high as early as next week. Van de Poppe highlighted $110.5 as the crucial breakout level. BTC could surge to a new all-time high if it clears this level. While momentum is slow, analysts believe the bull run is not yet over. The MVRC ratio is at 2:2, significantly lower than peak levels, indicating there is room to grow. BTC’s next big move depends on whether it can break above the resistance at around $110,000. However, analysts like AlphaBTC believe it will take substantial momentum to flip this resistance level. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued registering strong inflows. The week ending June 27 saw inflows skyrocket, with BlackRock’s IBIT registering weekly net inflows of $1,310 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registered net inflows of $504.5 million. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) registered net inflows of $268 million. US spot bitcoin ETFs extended their ETF streak to 14 sessions, recording over $2.9 billion in weekly inflows. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping 1.19% on Friday, slipping below the 50-day SMA, and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $102,180. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified. However, it rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. BTC surged over 4% on Monday following the Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement. As a result, it reclaimed $105,000 and settled at $105,442. The price continued pushing higher on Tuesday, rising 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,138. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Wednesday, with BTC rising 1.18% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,393. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $106,970. A marginal recovery on Friday saw BTC reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,129. Price action remained positive on Saturday, rising to $107,339. The current session sees BTC up 0.51%, trading around $107,885. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-29T15:28:28,"Crypto Weekly Roundup: Ripple-SEC Saga Ends, Truth Social Targets ETFs, & More","This week in crypto, Ripple and the SEC officially ended their five-year legal battle, though key penalties and restrictions on XRP sales remain. Major firms, including Bakkt, GameStop, and Trump’s Truth Social, made bold moves toward Bitcoin and crypto ETFs, while on the regulatory front, Kraken secured a MiCA license in Europe, Texas legalized Bitcoin reserves, and a U.S. senator proposed a crypto ban for top officials. Bitcoin Bakkt Holdings has filed for a $1 billion shelf offering with the SEC, indicating plans to acquire Bitcoin as part of its expanded treasury strategy. Business GameStop has raised $2.7 billion through a convertible notes offering and may allocate part of the proceeds to Bitcoin under its revised treasury policy, though future crypto purchases remain unconfirmed. Crypto hardware wallet firm Ledger has secured its first professional sports jersey sponsorship through a newly announced multi-year partnership with the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs. Trump Media & Technology Group has filed to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on the NYSE, raising fresh concerns over potential conflicts as the former president promotes crypto while seeking reelection. Metaplanet has allocated an additional $5 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, accelerating its ambitious plan to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027 and expand its global Bitcoin treasury operations. Web3 Moonveil, a Layer 2 gaming-focused chain, has confirmed the launch of its native token, $MORE , on Binance Alpha, followed by listings on a series of leading centralized exchanges, including Gate, MEXC, Bitget, KuCoin, BingX, and LBank. Edwin has officially launched its AI-powered terminal designed to simplify DeFi access by offering a conversational, non-custodial assistant, also called edwin , that helps users navigate onchain services through intuitive chat-based interactions. InfoFi is a decentralized finance offshoot that uses AI and blockchain to tokenize valuable data, like market trends and social sentiment, transforming it into a tradable asset within the attention economy. The multichain crypto swapping protocol Jumper Exchange is enhancing its already-extensive interoperability by adding support for the Tezos Layer-2 network Etherlink. This will enable crypto traders and DeFi users to bridge assets between Etherlink and more than 50 blockchains and Layer-2s, including Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum. Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) and Moonveil have partnered up to revolutionize the Web 3 gaming ecosystem, allowing for fully decentralized and trustless games on Moonveil by leveraging Impossible Cloud Network’s (ICN) decentralized multi-service cloud platform. Modular blockchain Cartesi’s latest build of its Honeypot application, Honeypot v2 , boasts Permissionless Refereed Tournaments (PRT), designed to ensure rollup resistance to Sybil attacks without forcing networks to rely on permissioned validators or heavy hardware. Regulation Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to drop all appeals and end their five-year legal battle. However, Ripple and the SEC’s joint efforts failed when a U.S. judge refused to slash the penalty and lift an injunction in the XRP case, keeping key restrictions on Ripple’s institutional token sales intact. Kraken has obtained a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license from Ireland’s central bank, enabling it to deliver regulated crypto services across 30 European states, strengthening its foothold in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. U.S. Senator Adam Schiff has introduced new legislation seeking to bar the President, Vice President, and their families from profiting through cryptocurrency ventures while holding office.

2025-06-29T15:00:39,"Bitcoin MVRV Golden Cross In Sight – Next Leg Up Could Be Near","Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum despite ongoing market volatility, holding firmly above the $100,000 level as anticipation builds for a breakout into price discovery. After weeks of consolidation and multiple failed attempts to break all-time highs, BTC remains resilient, fueling speculation that a massive move could be just around the corner. The crypto market as a whole is closely watching Bitcoin’s next steps, as its direction will likely set the tone for altcoins and broader risk assets. Adding to the bullish narrative is fresh data from Santiment, which highlights an important on-chain development: a potential golden cross between the MVRV Ratio and its 30-day simple moving average. Historically, this crossover has signaled major turning points for Bitcoin, often marking the start of strong upward trends. As the two lines converge, investor sentiment is beginning to shift, with more traders positioning for a breakout. While resistance remains near all-time highs, the technical and on-chain setup suggests that Bitcoin may soon break out of its current range. With momentum building and market confidence growing, a confirmed move into new highs could trigger the next major leg of the bull cycle. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Consolidates Above $105K After a period of heightened geopolitical tension involving the US, Israel, and Iran, global markets have found a sense of relief. With those conflicts now largely de-escalated, risk appetite has returned, and Bitcoin has responded with strength. The leading cryptocurrency pushed decisively above the $105,000 level, reclaiming short-term momentum and signaling renewed confidence among investors. However, BTC now faces a critical challenge: breaking into uncharted territory above its all-time highs. Currently trading just below the key resistance zone near $109K–$112K, Bitcoin is consolidating in a tight range. Price action has shown resilience, but momentum has paused as bulls and bears battle for control. Still, analysts believe a breakout may be close. Market structure is intact, and support levels have held firmly through recent macro volatility. Top analyst Ali Martinez has drawn attention to a compelling on-chain signal : a potential golden cross forming between Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio and its 30-day simple moving average. Historically, this crossover has preceded major upward moves and has served as a reliable indicator of trend reversals. Martinez suggests that if the cross confirms, it could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s next leg higher. The coming days will be crucial. A strong breakout above resistance could open the door to price discovery and reignite broader crypto market momentum. Conversely, failure to break through could lead to continued consolidation. For now, Bitcoin is coiled and ready, waiting for a decisive catalyst to define its next major move. BTC Momentum Builds On 4H Chart Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,322, showing a tight consolidation just below the key $109,300 resistance level. The 4-hour chart reveals a clear structure of higher lows following the rebound from the $103,600 support zone, which has held strongly through several tests. This level now serves as the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s current range, while $109,300 remains the critical resistance bulls must flip for further upside. The price is trading above all major moving averages on this timeframe—50 SMA ($105,166), 100 SMA ($105,291), and 200 SMA ($105,810)—which are now converging into a bullish alignment. This structure supports the short-term bullish bias, indicating strength and growing demand above $105K. However, volume remains relatively subdued during this consolidation phase, suggesting that traders are waiting for confirmation before initiating new positions. A breakout above $109,300, especially on strong volume, would likely trigger a push toward new highs and potentially begin price discovery. On the downside, a breakdown below $105K would invalidate the current bullish setup and put the $103,600 support at risk. For now, Bitcoin appears coiled within a well-defined range, with momentum slowly building ahead of what could be a decisive move.

2025-06-29T14:50:40,"IBIT:CA: Bitcoin Exposure For Non-Crypto Investors","Summary IBIT:CA offers convenient, cost-effective Bitcoin exposure for traditional investors through BlackRock’s trusted ETF structure, bypassing crypto exchange complexities. Bitcoin’s strong historical performance and growing mainstream adoption make it a compelling asset for diversification, hedging, or price participation. IBIT:CA stands out with a low 0.32% management fee, matching Fidelity and undercutting other Canadian Bitcoin ETFs on cost. The ETF structure reduces custodial risk, but investors must accept Bitcoin’s high volatility and regulatory risks; prudent allocation is advised. Author's Note: All figures listed in Canadian currency unless otherwise noted. Investment Thesis The iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT:CA ) offers a convenient and cost-effective means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) through BlackRock’s family of iShares ETFs. In eight of the past eleven calendar years to 2024, bitcoin was the best performing asset by asset class. Whether for diversification, hedging or price exposure, bitcoin has seen its ownership base expand from crypto-enthusiasts to institutional and traditional investors. Traditional investors seeking exposure to bitcoin for participation in cryptocurrency may have found bitcoin to be inaccessible, inconvenient or intimidating due to the complex nature of coin exchanges or crypto exchange platforms. IBIT:CA offers the familiarity of an ETF format presented by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers. This product is an ideal vehicle for investors who want exposure to Bitcoin without having to interface with the complexities of owning it directly through a crypto exchange. Fund Profile Launched in Canada in January 2025, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has net assets of approximately $215MM on 5.1 million units outstanding. This Canadian debut follows the January 2024 listing of iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) on the NASDAQ. This U.S.-listed fund has grown to $70B in assets and has consistently been the highest volume bitcoin ETF. Through a custodial partnership with Coinbase, IBIT seeks to reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. IBIT:CA trades on the Cboe Global Stock Exchange, operating in Canada since 2015. This stock exchange is responsible for approximately 15% of listed security trading volume in Canada and specializes in ETFs, with over 1,200 funds trading on their ETF Market Canada. Beyond a small cash contingency of 0.08% to facilitate liquidity, Canadian-listed IBIT:CA invests substantially all of its holdings in the underlying U.S.-listed IBIT. This ETF can be owned in Canadian funds ((IBIT:CA)) or in U.S. currency ( IBIT.U:CA ) iShares Bitcoin ETF - USD Units. IBIT:CA has a management fee of 0.32%, equating to $32 in fees for every $10,000 invested. With no dividends and a strategy of long-term holding, the fund does not have any distributions. Background Bitcoin is not a productive asset in and of itself, therefore it’s helpful to think about cryptocurrency as an asset class to gain exposure to, rather than a vehicle to generate wealth. It is with this risk management lens that I consider the role of bitcoin in my portfolio. In previous coverage of MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) “MicroStrategy Incorporated: Get Bitcoin Exposure Without Leaving The Nasdaq”, I wrote: If you are a traditional investor like me who holds a portfolio of publicly traded equities in a brokerage account, you may have been sitting on the sidelines as bitcoin makes fresh headlines for breaking new valuation records. As a long-term buy-and-hold investor, I don’t spend a lot of time chasing fads or making investment decisions based on the “fear of missing out.” I do however spend time thinking about asset allocation in my portfolio and protection against inflation. The iShares Bitcoin ETF allows less adventurous investors to add bitcoin to their portfolios without leaving their brokerage accounts. My preference is to have my securities all in one place to optimize portfolio management. With this in mind, I have been reluctant to deal with the hassle of opening an account on a cryptocurrency trading platform. I prefer the simplicity of a one-stop-shop discount brokerage platform and am uninterested in transferring funds, reviewing a new trading commission structure and registering with another platform. The familiarity with the ETF structure and the iShares suite of products that can be purchased through one’s existing brokerage makes IBIT:CA convenient and accessible. My own brokerage account has an integrated cryptocurrency trading platform, so I can manage my modest bitcoin exposure within the context of my larger portfolio. This platform reflects my ""core and explore"" style of investing, whereby I hold a core portfolio of diversified equities with some modest exposure to bitcoin and other alternatives. In recent years, investor confidence in crypto exchanges was shaken through the high-profile fraud case of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX. A 2024 report from the Pew Research Center found that 63% said they had little to no confidence that ""current ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe"". For many investors, including myself, the opportunity to bypass cryptocurrency exchanges by owning bitcoin through exchange-listed wrappers on local exchanges offers additional peace of mind and removes a barrier to participation. Does Bitcoin Belong in Your Portfolio? I am not a bitcoin evangelist and I am not prepared to articulate a bull case for the cryptocurrency. It is worth noting, however, that as an asset class, bitcoin has delivered impressive long-term performance, far outpacing equity market indices. Performance of Bitcoin vs the S&P500 (SA) While I do not advocate chasing past performance, I do think that there is room for multiple asset classes to be represented within a diversified portfolio. To this end, it may be worth evaluating whether some exposure to bitcoin makes sense in your own portfolio. Bitcoin has become increasingly mainstream and institutional. With a $2.1T market cap , pension funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors have been drawn to bitcoin for the increased liquidity, transparency and exposure to new asset classes. A 2025 digital assets survey from EY-Parthenon research indicated that 85% of respondents increased allocations to digital assets and digital assets-related products in 2024. This survey also reports that firms have been increasing their weightings in digital assets, with 59% of respondents planning to allocate over 5% of their assets under management to cryptocurrencies. 2025Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey (EY Digital Asset Survey 2025) The growing suite of products for retail investors also speaks to bitcoin's shift toward mainstream investing. This growth has taken off following the January, 2024 decision from the SEC to greenlight the creation of U.S.-listed ETFs tracking the spot price of bitcoin. Retail investors have wasted no time in moving into these new funds. According to RBC Direct Investing : Inflows to U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted over $6 billion of inflows in May, equating to 7% of all ETF inflows this month. It is a notable haul and propels IBIT to the 5th highest amount of YTD ETF inflows; joining an impressive list led by beta-stalwarts VOO, SGOV, VTI and SPLG. Peer ETF Comparison With a singular underlying asset and no meaningful portfolio composition to differentiate bitcoin ETFs, these funds compete on fees. Bitcoin ETFs have been available in Canada since February 2021, when the Purpose Bitcoin ETF ( BTCC:CA ) debuted. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF has $3B in assets offering ample liquidity, however it has a relatively high 1.31% MER with a 1% management fee. The first mover advantage Purpose had in this space allowed it to charge a higher fee. The CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF C$ Unhedged Series Units ( BTCX.B:CA ), has approximately $1.3B in assets. This ETF charges an MER of 0.69% with a management fee of 0.40%. The Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC:CA ) is the third-largest provider in Canada with $1.2B in assets. Responding to new market entrants like iShares, Fidelity recently lowered its management fee from 0.40% to 0.32%. ETF Assets Management Fee iShares Bitcoin ETF ((IBIT:CA)) $215MM 0.32% Purpose Bitcoin ETF ((BTCC:CA)) $3.0B 1.00% CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF C$ Unhedged Series Units ((BTCX.B:CA)) $1.3B 0.40% Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF ((FBTC:CA)) $1.2B 0.32% Compared to its more established peers, the iShares Bitcoin ETF ties with Fidelity in offering relative value with its management fee of 0.32%. IBIT:CA hasn’t been trading long enough to report its MER. Risk Analysis This ETF structure seeks to mitigate the custodial risks associated with owning bitcoin directly through a crypto exchange platform. The inherent risks of the underlying cryptocurrency asset are still reflected in IBIT:CA, however. Bitcoin is highly volatile. While bitcoin has clocked double-digit returns in eight of the past eleven calendar years, when BTC corrects, it has done so in dramatic fashion. In 2018, bitcoin lost 78% of its value and again in 2022, it gave up gains to close 64% down. Bitcoin performance vs other asset classes (Blackrock iShares) Beyond volatility, IBIT:CA is highly concentrated with the ETF comprised of a singular asset. Prudent investors may consider a modest position in IBIT:CA as a complement to a diversified portfolio of stocks. Importantly, iShares rates the ETF’s risk as “high”, the highest rating on its five point risk scale. Investors should also consider regulatory risks before owning cryptocurrencies. The pro-crypto stance taken by the Trump administration in the U.S. has increasingly led to a regulatory environment seen by the industry as more constructive for product innovation. In other jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are viewed less favourably. Crypto Regulation by Country (Coinclub) Conclusion The iShares Bitcoin ETF offers an accessible and convenient option for Canadian investors seeking exposure to bitcoin. The ETF structure allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to engage with a cryptocurrency exchange and to own it through a familiar institutional name, BlackRock. With one of the lowest management fees in the sector, IBIT:CA offers better value than larger incumbent bitcoin ETFs. With little to differentiate these products, the lower fee is an important consideration. For traditional investors curious about cryptocurrency, this is an easy way to test the waters.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798113-ibitca-bitcoin-exposure-for-non-crypto-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT:CA|BTC-USD|IBIT",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T14:43:44,"PUDGY PENGUINS PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (June 29) – Pengu Takes Breath After Surging 50% in a Week, More Gains Ahead?","Amid the latest pause in Bitcoin’s rally, Pengu and a few other meme coins have regained momentum and shown strength after a month of decline. While indicating a bullish move, it is currently down on the day. Since the Ceasefire in the Middle East, a few meme coins have recovered nicely from their recent lows and posted gains over the past 48 hours. Pengu leads the rally so far with an over 30% increase, but it currently appears to have slowed down the rally after failing to close above the $0.015 level yesterday. The current daily drop looks more like a retest of a broken level. There’s still hope for more increases in the short term as the buyers are likely to mount pressure as soon as they find support on the lower timeframe. If that fails to happen, the Solana-based token may pull lower before picking up again. But from the look of things, the bulls are much more likely to have an upper hand in the coming days, provided that Bitcoin’s price remains strong weekly. Otherwise, the entire crypto market may continue to fall. Currently, market sentiments and biases look positive with a potential bullish sign. Once Pengu manages to surpass the previous monthly high, a bigger rally can be expected in the short term. Pengu Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Pengu currently appears indecisive on the daily chart. A push above yesterday’s high could allow recovery to the previous monthly $0.0175 resistance. The $0.0274 and $0.047 resistance levels would be the next area of interest to watch for a breakout. Failure to advance bullish may result in a deep pullback to the key $0.01 level. Below it lies the $0.0076 support. A breakdown there could roll us back to the $0.00525 level. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0175, $0.0274, $0.047 Key Support Levels: $0.01, $0.0076, $0.00525 Price: $0.0134 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The chart indicates a significant bullish reversal, with an inverted hammer candlestick pattern spotted in the analysis. The analysis is grounded in classical technical charting principles and predicts a potential uptrend as the pair moves toward a breakout in August. #XRP / #BTC – You Are Not #Bullish Enough: Inverted Hammer Candles #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and We Shall Fly So High . pic.twitter.com/imoZwmKA0E — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 28, 2025 XRP Inverted Hammer and Support Structure The chart features a large symmetrical triangle structure containing XRP/BTC’s recent price action. At the time of his analysis, the pair traded around 0.00002042 BTC ($2.194), sitting on the edge of structural support. What makes the current setup notable is the formation of an inverted hammer candlestick , which is commonly interpreted as a bullish reversal signal, particularly after a downtrend. The analyst emphasizes that XRP is not being viewed bullishly enough by the broader market, despite technical evidence to the contrary. He encourages the XRP community to “stay steady and strong,” reinforcing the sentiment that a major price move could be on the horizon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Fibonacci Levels and Short-Term Targets Critical resistance levels are also clearly laid out. This includes the Fibonacci retracement zones. Notably, the 0.702 level (approximately 0.00002468 BTC/$2.652) and the 0.786 level (around 0.00002893 BTC/$3.1) are marked as key upside targets in the short to mid-term. These lie above the current range but within striking distance should bullish momentum emerge. A green zone extending to 0.00002700 BTC ($2.9) provides a cue for a potential breakout zone above triangle resistance. Conversely, a red horizontal support line at approximately 0.00001930 BTC ($2.07) signals the last line of structural defense. This coincides with the lower boundary of the triangle and appears to be acting as a base for the inverted hammer to take effect. XRP Long-term Targets Longer-term projections are drawn using Fibonacci extensions, with the 1.272, 1.414, and 1.618 levels suggesting potential future targets of 0.00007262 BTC ($7.8), 0.00009502 BTC ($10.2), and 0.00013982 BTC ($15), respectively. These targets sit well above historical resistance, and all represent new all-time highs for XRP if the current pattern plays out. EGRAG CRYPTO has previously predicted double-digit targets for XRP , and the chart marks August 25 as a key date for the upcoming breakout. While market confirmation is still pending, the groundwork for an upward move is technically laid out, with specific levels to monitor in the weeks ahead.

2025-06-29T14:33:15,"BITO: On The Verge Of A Break To New Highs","Summary BITO provides convenient Bitcoin exposure via futures, offering strong correlation and significant income distributions, though not a perfect 1:1 price tracker. Distributions are highly volatile but meaningful, totaling nearly half the share price over the past year, making total return analysis essential. While direct Bitcoin ownership outperformed BITO on total return, BITO's accessibility and income potential make it an attractive alternative for many investors. Technical patterns and momentum indicators suggest further upside, so I maintain my strong buy rating on BITO for continued Bitcoin exposure. As alt-coin OG Bitcoin is knocking on the door to all-time highs once again, it’s a good chance to review which funds are best to gain exposure, if you so choose. Cryptos are firmly in the mainstream of investing now, as the rise of exchange-traded funds in their dozens, making it easier than ever to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. One very popular choice for Bitcoin exposure is the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) , a $2.5 billion fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin, but with a twist. The last time I covered BITO was last October, and I called it a strong buy on the idea that its downtrend was ending. It’s up 61% on a total return basis since then, so we’ll call that one a win. But what about now? I’m still quite bullish, and I’m doubling down on my strong buy rating. What is BITO? BITO seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin over time, minus fees and expenses. That’s a familiar goal as there are numerous funds that look to do the very same thing. But rather than owning Bitcoin directly, BITO owns a huge position in Bitcoin futures. Here’s what the fund owns as of the close on Friday. Fund website The fund owns $2.5 billion in July Bitcoin futures, and it rolls its positions regularly so it’s always got what is essentially spot exposure to Bitcoin futures. That, in turn, tracks spot Bitcoin prices without owning Bitcoin directly. This is a slightly different philosophy to funds that directly own Bitcoin, but as we’ll see below, owning futures works as well. StockCharts This is the 20-day rolling correlation between BITO and Bitcoin itself, and its current value is 0.89. That’s actually a bit lower than it has been in recent months, when it spent a lot of time very near 1.00. At any rate, 0.89 is still almost perfect, so if you’re looking for Bitcoin exposure, you can do much worse. The other thing is that BITO is not just a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin pricing; it offers massive distributions as well. Some funds do not offer distributions, and therefore, their price charts will more closely reflect the movements of Bitcoin itself. BITO offers that exposure to Bitcoin, but also a huge amount of distributions. ProShares has an explanation of how BITO (and its other similar funds) generate distribution, if you’re curious. And those distributions are extremely consequential to total returns for BITO. Seeking Alpha We can see that distributions are extremely volatile, so this is nothing like owning a Dividend King where you know what you’re getting with reasonable accuracy. BITO distributes based upon the formula in the link above, and the payout changes every single month. Over time, the distributions are meaningful to say the least, but the monthly payout range for the past year has been 36 cents to $1.77. Total distributions in the past 12 months is almost $12 per share , or more than half the current share price. That means that if we’re going to track BITO’s progress against simply owning Bitcoin itself – which is a logical alternative – we need to look at total returns, not simply price returns. Seeking Alpha For the past year, Bitcoin itself has outperformed BITO on a total return basis by about 15%. That’s a lot, and if you want to get the best exposure to Bitcoin, you’ll need a way to do that directly. However, if you like the ease and accessibility of owning it through an exchange-traded fund, BITO offers a nice alternative. The other thing is that BITO offers strong income possibilities, whereas Bitcoin obviously doesn’t, and never will. That income can be reinvested for more shares of BITO, or it can fund your lifestyle. It’s just a different way to gain exposure, and it’s not for everyone. Where is BITO headed? I have remained bullish on Bitcoin and linked funds for some time, and nothing about that has changed. The pattern in BITO looks very much to me like a bull flag, and if that’s right, BITO (and Bitcoin) are headed much higher. StockCharts BITO ran from the April low of $15 to a new high of $22.56, all the while paying its distributions. There was a 50-day SMA test in the past week, from which BITO bounced immediately and significantly. The flag pattern is filling out very nicely, the upper and lower bounds of which you can see above. In addition, the PPO has made a centerline test and the histogram is looking like it’s about to go positive. If that occurs, it makes the breakout direction from the flag much more likely to be up. Flags are consolidation patterns, so they are likely to resolve in the direction of prior trend. That was obviously an uptrend, and it amounted to about $7 per share from the April low. Should the flag resolve to the upside – which I fully expect – we should be looking at a similar move in BITO. That would be something like $29 as a target. We’ll see, but the risk/reward here is excellent as you can use the 50-day SMA, or the bottom of the flag pattern as a stop. Wrapping up If you are looking for direct exposure one-for-one with Bitcoin, BITO probably isn’t the best choice for that. The price doesn’t strictly track Bitcoin because BITO pays such massive distributions, and has a bit of tracking error from the futures it owns. On a total return basis, as well as the correlation of prices between the two, it is quite good. BITO offers income in a big way, but also the ease and convenience of owning Bitcoin exposure through an exchange-traded product rather than needing a wallet to hold Bitcoin. I continue to like Bitcoin, and I continue to like BITO as an alternative way to gain exposure to Bitcoin upside. I’m retaining my strong buy on BITO here.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798111-bito-on-the-verge-of-a-break-to-new-highs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","BITO",cryptocompare

Related Reading: You Won’t Believe Who’s Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Liquidity Zone (7 Days) indicator, which measures three important data: on one hand, it is used to monitor the price movement of Bitcoin; on another, the Net Delta of open interest or positions; and, lastly, it shows the distribution of open interest at various price levels. For a little context, the open interest Net Delta measures the difference between long and short open positions in the market. If the Net Delta reads positive, it means the buyers populate the market more. On the other hand, a negative reading means there are more short positions open than longs. In the post on X, Alphractal pointed out that, over the span of seven days, more positions have been opened in a bet against the price of BTC. From the chart below, the red bars represent a negative Net Delta. As has been formerly explained, what this means is that the short traders currently dominate the market. Interestingly, the shorts-dominated market does not exactly guarantee that we will experience a sell-off in the near future. This is because the high negative Net Delta was recorded at a time when Bitcoin’s price is still at a stable level, even with little growth. When sell positions are opened in a stable but bullish market, this usually indicates that the bears might be getting trapped. If, eventually, the Bitcoin price overcomes the sell resistance, a phenomenon known as a short squeeze will occur. In this scenario, sellers will be forced to buy back at higher prices, thereby pushing the Bitcoin price to the upside. This upward momentum will then further liquidate short positions. What’s Next For Bitcoin? There are uncertainties as to whether the Bitcoin market might break the sell resistance, or go in favour of the sellers. For this reason, Alphractal warns that those with bearish sentiment should be cautious about their next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,500 In Squeeze-Driven Rally – But Can It Hold?

The firm’s trading desk says that it’s “time to get bulled up again” following the de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, reports CNBC. America’s largest bank says fading geopolitical risks are enabling investors to shift their attention back to market fundamentals. “With Israel/Iran seemingly defused, the market is resuming its march to/through all-time highs… With this geopolitical risk behind us, the market is refocusing on the macro picture, preparing for earnings, and watching the looming deadline on the expiration of the tariff moratorium. We shift our view back to Tactically Bullish with the bullish hypothesis based on resilient macro data, positive EPS (earnings per share) growth and thawing trade war rhetoric.” Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is keeping a close watch on one group of stocks that it thinks will make an epic comeback in the coming months. In a new Bloomberg Television interview, Morgan Stanley Investment Management senior portfolio manager Andrew Slimmon says that the Magnificent 7 stocks, which dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500, will likely soar next year as they start to see their investments in artificial intelligence pay off. “I hear all the time: US exceptionalism is over. That’s the argument for outside the US. I get that. But I think what’s really going on here is that the very large, the Magnificent Seven, they’re spending a lot of money on capex (capital expenditures) rollout, and they’re telling us, ‘Don’t worry, this will all pay off down the road.’ Well, I wouldn’t bet against these guys, but right now their return on invested capital has come down a little bit. So I could see a scenario where you get to the end of the year, the rest of the world has done better than the S&P and the 493 has done better than the cap-weighted, and everyone said, ‘Oh, it’s all over, US exceptionalism is all over.’ And guess what? All these companies that start to employ AI are going to use these services, and you’re going to see the S&P cap-weighted come roaring back next year.” The Mag 7 is made up of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta.

2025-06-29T14:19:41,"Columbus Circle Capital I: Ugly Merger, Interesting Trade","Summary CCCM's merger with ProCap BTC values Bitcoin holdings at a steep premium, disadvantaging SPAC investors compared to direct BTC or ETF exposure. Deal structure favors preferred equity and the sponsor, leaving SPAC shareholders with less than their fair share and significant downside if BTC falls. Post-merger strategy lacks clarity on building a real operating business, and the capital structure limits flexibility to capitalize on BTC price moves. Despite long-term skepticism, CCCM offers a low-risk, short-term trade opportunity with limited downside and potential upside before the redemption deadline. This week, SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I ( CCCM ) announced plans to merge with ProCap BTC LLC. As a SPAC, CCC is just a pile of cash; ProCap is essentially just a pile of Bitcoin. At the current CCCM stock price of $10.73, and the current BTC price of just over $107,000, the merger values each dollar in ProCap's Bitcoin stash at about $1.43. Whether that's a good deal is a matter of perspective. One view is that paying $1.43 in cash for $1 in Bitcoin is ludicrous on its face. Investors can buy Bitcoin for pretty close to $1, whether via direct ownership or an exchange-traded fund. ProCap's structure does suggest some leverage to the BTC price, but that leverage is not guaranteed, and investors have myriad ways to gain levered exposure to Bitcoin, all of which appear to be lower-cost. The contrary view, however, is that 1.43:1 is actually a pretty good ratio for what have become known as Bitcoin treasury companies. The pioneer and the largest of the group obviously is Strategy ( MSTR ), which has an enterprise value 1.87x the value of its Bitcoin holdings. There's some value in Strategy's legacy software business, but at this point not much; even accounting for those operations, the premium here is in the range of 80%. Other companies (130, per the CCC/ProCap merger presentation) have executed similar strategies in Bitcoin and other coins and gotten bigger premiums; Metaplanet ( OTC:MTPLF ) is valued at nearly 5x its Bitcoin stash . The problem for ProCap, however, is that the initial response to the deal itself suggests the post-merger entity is not likely to follow the MSTR path, let alone that of Metaplanet. Meanwhile, ProCap chief executive officer Anthony Pompliano, a longtime investor (and Twitter/X personality and podcast host), has made some comments about creating an operating business here as well, but it's not clear exactly that is supposed to be. To top it off, the structure of the capital raise beyond the SPAC cash suggests a real possibility of a wave of pre-merger redemptions. All told, it's hard to have too much optimism about the post-merger entity here. But with CCCM stock not that far above the redemption price, there is an interesting pre-merger trade to be had, with a low-risk option on a spike in BTC and/or a return to a more optimistic outlook toward crypto treasury companies more broadly. The Deal Structure For CCCM Stock The post-merger ProCap will have $1 billion in capital, raised from three sources : CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 The SPAC has $256 million in cash in trust, thanks to a $250 million initial public offering last month. The $517 million in equity already has been raised, with most of the funds used to buy BTC over the last two days. The convertibles will be issued at the merger close. On its face, this doesn't seem like a bad deal: ProCap is raising $1 billion and buying just shy of 9,500 BTC (note that the presentation was based on a BTC price of $100,000). But a closer look shows that SPAC investors are being disadvantaged here. It also explains why the initial optimism toward the deal, spiked by leaked details to the Financial Times , has faded so dramatically: Data by YCharts Notably, the preferred equity is getting into the SPAC at $8 per share (each preferred stock unit converts to common stock at a 1.25x ratio ). The notes convert at $13 per share, but they're also 2x collateralized by Bitcoin (or cash, but as seen above the post-merger ProCap will have minimal cash). Paying $10.70 For $7.50 (Or Less) Because of both the discount offered the preferred equity holder and a pretty substantial promote for Pompliano, CCCM investors wind up getting what looks like less than their fair share: CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 In the indicative example, with the BTC price at $100,000, post-merger ProCap would be have a net asset value of $955 million ($950 million in BTC plus $5 million in cash). SPAC shareholders would get 19.7%, or $188 million; even at $10, the premium is about 1.33x. In reality, the numbers are a bit different. ProCap already has purchased 4,932 BTC this week for a total of $514 million. That leaves $436 million in cash (from the SPAC and the converts), for an NAV of $950 million, or a per-share NAV of $7.50. The current price of $10.70 is thus about a 1.43x premium. But even that is a bit inflated, because it assumes the convertibles actually convert into stock. Treat the converts as debt (as would be the case with CCCM and/or the post-merger stock below $13) and NAV is actually $715 million across 108.6 million shares. That's a per-share figure of just $6.58, suggesting a current premium of about 63%. (It's also an example of just how important the convertibles actually converting is to the success of the treasury plan.) Two Post-Merger Problems For Columbus Circle Capital I The structure here creates two problems assuming the merger goes through. The first is looking to the downside and upside. Even if the cash from the SPAC and the converts buys BTC at $100K (adding 4,910 BTC, essentially doubling the current stash), a move in the Bitcoin price to $80K would leave net asset value somewhere around $550 million (again, treating the converts as debt, so 108.6 million shares outstanding and $230M in net debt). Net asset value here is a little over $5; in this scenario, it's not hard to imagine CCCM dropping below $7. In other words, the downside here is amplified even with some kind of treasury premium: a ~25% decline in Bitcoin leads to a 35%-plus drop in CCCM stock. But the converse is not necessarily true. The SPAC agreement includes ""adjustment shares"", which will be issued to the sponsor and the preferred equity investors if BTC rises between now and the close. Basically, their number of shares increases by the same percentage BTC does . Imagine, for instance, BTC doubling; the share of equity owned by SPAC shareholders in the post-merger ProCap drops by half . NAV ($7.50 per share assuming conversion) only goes to about $10; at the same premium, CCCM stock would be worth less than $15. For this to work, then, the premium has to expand . In theory, post-merger this can happen (and indeed it has happened for MSTR, which has consistently outpaced Bitcoin). But part of the reason Strategy has outperformed is that it keeps adding to its Bitcoin haul on the way up. It would seem that ProCap has designs on a similar strategy (no pun intended). The issue is that the post-merger structure means that the company will have no cash to adjust its holdings. Pompliano and ProCap claim to have a workaround, however, as witnessed by the last two bullet points on this slide: CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 The problem is that the strategy here, such as it is, is basically to buy (Bitcoin) low and sell (CCCM stock) high. In bullet point #2, ""Strategically rais[ing] capital during favorable market cycles to scale our Bitcoin holdings"" means that ProCap will issue equity and/or converts when the demand is there. ""Tactical accumulation, including strategic dips, volatility harvesting, and programmatic purchases aligned with macro signals and capital cycles"" is a long way of saying that ProCap wants to buy the coin low. Buying low and selling high perhaps can work for an expert trader. For a publicly traded company, however, it's a much more difficult endeavor. Is ProCap going to have an at-the-market offering that just dumps shares every time the premium to BTC expands? That seems like an instantly recognizable and consistent overhang. Is it in turn going to buy every dip in BTC? That's certainly been a smart strategy for the past 15-plus years, but, again, ProCap has to actually raise the cash to make those buys. More broadly, there's no real evidence that Pompliano (or his associates) have the acumen to move into Bitcoin and out of the stock in a way that is accretive to shareholder value rather than investment bank and exchange fees. To be fair, Pompliano has said that ProCap will build a business on top of the Bitcoin stash. As he told CNBC in an interview : I believe that the future of these companies is going to be how do you build revenue and profit with financial services on top of that. No different than if you look at the traditional financial service firms. They have a balance sheet of dollars, and they go and they build these financial services on top that drive revenue and profit. I think that you still have to build a business on top of a big pile of Bitcoin. But there's been zero discussion of what these ""financial services"" are supposed to be. Pompliano told CNBC that he and ProCap ""sit at the intersection between the Internet and the Bitcoiners and the institutional world."" That's been a good business for Pompliano personally — he himself is investing $8.5 million in the deal — but there is no real evidence that positioning will create a good business for ProCap shareholders. Owning CCCM And Not ProCap And yet, with the pullback below $11, there is an intriguing potential trade here. The merger presentation cited $256 million in trust value for the CCCM SPAC, meaning redemption value should be $10.24 per share. That suggests 4%-5% downside from the current level (the cash in trust will increase over time as interest is accrued, but investors still will be down 4%-5% relative to simply holding a money market fund or short-term Treasuries). That's not a terrible downside given that there is some potential upside between now and when the redemption deadline for the merger arrives. A sharp rally in BTC would probably bleed over here. Meanwhile, the merger presentation points out Pompliano's impressive online reach. At least from a Twitter/X search, Bitcoin fans seem mostly disappointed with the deal , (trading in CCCM obviously suggests the same) but Pompliano has the time and the megaphone to change sentiment. Indeed, we've already seen a similar trade work in another SPAC, Colombier Acquisition Corp. II ( CLBR ). CLBR too saw an early retail-driven rally (this one being more political; Donald Trump Jr. is involved with its target, GrabAGun) that faded, only to bounce back strongly. When I covered the name in February, CLBR was barely above its redemption price; it's since gained 35%. CLBR was probably a better trade than CCCM; the structure here (particularly as the adjustment shares are understood) seems like it's leading toward a quite high redemption rate. Given that the premium to BTC for a treasury company is based on sentiment, the early response to the merger announcement itself is a red flag longer-term. But with 4-5% downside, and the volatility inherent in anything remotely exposed to crypto, CCCM seems like an interesting trade, too — at least until shares no longer can be redeemed. After that, the outlook looks much murkier, and much worse.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798109-columbus-circle-capital-i-ugly-merger-interesting-trade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|CCCM|CCCMU",cryptocompare

2025-06-29T13:38:08,"Ethereum Price Prediction: $10,000 Target Returns Amid Multi-Cycle Ascending Channel – Is ETH Ready?","During the US session on Sunday, Ethereum (ETH) is looking strong at $2,457, up 1.27% on the day. This is in line with the growing chatter that ETH could reach $10,000 in this cycle, as it has been stuck in a multi-year channel since 2017. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlights the significance of Ethereum’s long-term rising trend. Historical touchpoints along the lower band of this channel have triggered massive rallies, with increases of up to 300x in 2017 and 50x in 2020. While such extreme multiples are less likely now due to ETH’s $292 billion market cap, Pillows believes a climb toward $10,000 remains plausible. Analyst Spots Long-Term Pattern That Could Send ETH to $10,000 https://t.co/8E8yK0cuaK #Crypto #Ethereum — Coindoo.com (@coindoo) June 29, 2025 However, technical resistance must first be overcome. ETH was twice rejected near $2,600 in June. Analysts like Crypto Patel signal a clean break, and a close over $2,800 would confirm a bullish shift, potentially targeting $4,000 and beyond. Whale Activity and Withdrawals Reflect Long-Term Belief On-chain data supports the bullish thesis. Whale wallets and institutions are steadily accumulating ETH, even as price action remains range-bound. Lookonchain reports SharpLink Gaming acquired $4.82 million worth of ETH OTC, raising its total exposure to $478 million. Sharplink Gaming bought another $4,820,000 $ETH via OTC. They now hold $425,470,000 Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/0QtDdHcUAS — Ted (@TedPillows) June 28, 2025 Additional signs of confidence: $4.56M deposited into Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, likely for staking $293M withdrawn from exchanges—suggesting a move to cold wallets Low volatility accompanied by high-value transfers These patterns suggest whales are preparing for future appreciation rather than trading short-term moves. Network Growth vs Market Price: Disconnect or Opportunity? Ethereum’s network activity is surging. Daily transactions have topped 1.5 million, and active addresses exceed 356,000—the highest levels since early 2023. Gas fees have jumped 130% in a week, reaching $10.26M, indicating increased demand for DeFi and NFT platforms. Despite this, ETH’s price lags. Key valuation indicators reflect caution: NVT Ratio spiked to 2044—implying price may be ahead of usage MVRV Z-score dipped into negative territory, suggesting holders are underwater This disconnect between price and fundamentals could be a hidden buying opportunity—or a sign of excessive hype. Bitcoin Final Take: Breakout Depends on Key Levels Although the Ethereum price prediction remains bullish, is it really heading toward $10,000? Well, that depends on: Break above $2,800 to confirm the trend Whale interest and staking flows to stick Network usage to translate into price gains If ETH maintains its support around $2,400 and Bitcoin’s dominance stabilizes, Ethereum may follow with a breakout. Analysts at XForceGlobal expect a Wyckoff-style move toward $9,400 if momentum builds.

2025-06-29T13:24:16,"BTC and ETH Rebound as Altseason Optimism Fades: Binance Report","ˇTThis week, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) recovered from the decline triggered by geopolitical developments last week. While BTC showed greater resilience compared to ETH, both assets rebounded strongly as tensions appeared to ease. According to a weekly report by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, Bitcoin’s dominance recorded a slight decline during the recovery. However, this is not a strong indication that the market will soon witness an altseason. BTC, ETH Prices Rebound Binance said bitcoin’s resilience signaled a potential shift toward risk assets as macro conditions somewhat improved. After a broader shakeout triggered by geopolitical tensions, both traditional assets and BTC ended the week in the green. However, BTC solidified its position as an emerging hedge asset amid geopolitical uncertainty, recovering to $107,000 after falling to $98,000 at the beginning of the week. On the other hand, ETH followed a similar trajectory but exhibited greater downside volatility and a less pronounced recovery. The asset’s performance showed that it is less established in the role of a hedge asset. ETH closed the week below its opening price at $2,480 after plunging to a low of $2,130 on Monday. “While it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will sustain its outperformance following this weekend’s events, its strong initial recovery may signal market expectations for a continued upward trend in the largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at ~66%,” Binance added. Altseason Optimism Fades As both assets strive to remain above certain support zones, optimism for an altseason in this cycle is fading. Investors are increasingly asking when the altseason will begin. According to historical data, these have consistently followed strong BTC rallies, becoming more pronounced when the leading asset enters a consolidation phase. During these times, capital has rotated from BTC to more volatile, small-cap altcoins with higher speculative appeal. Interestingly, past altcoin seasons have been characterized by new industry themes, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and layer-2 solutions. In this cycle, the prevailing concepts — meme coins, BitcoinFi, and decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) — are modifications of previous trends, so they are not strong enough to trigger major rallies. This cycle is also different because of the oversaturated market of new projects. Binance analysts insist that even if fresh capital flows into altcoins, it is likely to be diluted across the numerous tokens currently in existence. Hence, the market requires a significant catalyst to trigger the altseason, as capital rotation and industry narratives are no longer sufficient.

Meme coin Hosico Cat (HOSICO) is up nearly 44% in 24 hours, buoyed by a $2.2 million Solana giveaway campaign. Meanwhile, Everscale (EVER) spiked on the back of a high-profile conference and ecosystem upgrades, and Shentu (CTK) soared despite a lack of clear catalysts. The rally among these altcoins suggests traders are chasing momentum and community-driven projects while waiting for a breakout in larger-cap assets. Hosico Cat Hosico Cat has surged 43.7% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.02769 from a low of $0.01889. The meme coin has shown a strong surge over a longer timeframe, climbing close to 82% in the last 30 days. HOSICO 24H price chart The price surge appears connected to a major promotional campaign the project is running.

Large-scale giveaways like this often drive short-term price action as they increase visibility and bring in new holders looking to participate in the rewards distribution. Hosico Cat, the inspiration behind the meme coin, is a well-known Scottish Straight cat famous for his golden fur and expressive face reminiscent of the character Puss in Boots.

2025-06-29T13:03:00,"Coinbase Named TIME ‘Disruptor’ as Stock Soars 42% on Crypto Policy Wins","TIME has named Coinbase one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies, highlighting the crypto exchange as a “disruptor” for its aggressive policy advocacy in Washington and growing impact on US digital asset markets. Key Takeaways: TIME named Coinbase a 2025 “disruptor,” citing its outsized influence on US crypto policy and markets. Coinbase’s stock surged 42% this year, boosted by Senate passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and S&P 500 inclusion. The exchange is expanding in Europe and pursuing tokenized equities approval. The recognition follows a sharp 42% year-to-date surge in Coinbase’s stock, which climbed from around $303 to a high of $382 after the Senate passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill on June 17. TIME noted that Coinbase , which in May became the first crypto stock added to the S&P 500 index, is “a key driver of the industry’s policy efforts in Washington D.C.” Coinbase to Be at the Center of US Crypto Hub: TIME With more industry-friendly legislation on the horizon, the publication said Coinbase could cement its role as the central hub for US crypto trading. Coinbase’s influence extends beyond the US. On June 20, the exchange secured a license to provide digital asset services across the European Union under the MiCA regulatory framework, granted by Luxembourg’s financial regulator. Coinbase will establish its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, a move expected to strengthen its global footprint. Looking ahead, Coinbase is seeking approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer tokenized equities , a move that could pit it directly against trading platforms like Robinhood and WeBull in the battle for retail investors. Moien, Lëtzebuerg. We’re pleased to have secured our Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) licence from the CSSF in Luxembourg. We can now offer a full suite of crypto products and services to 450 million people across all 27 European Union member states. pic.twitter.com/e9zbhy35YQ — Coinbase (@coinbase) June 20, 2025 Adding to Coinbase’s momentum, US President Donald Trump pledged at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in June to build a “clear and simple” regulatory framework for crypto markets under his administration. In a pre-recorded message, Trump said, “We will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.” Coinbase’s rising profile and policy wins come as institutional and retail investors increasingly view the exchange as a bellwether for the broader crypto market’s health. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs.

2025-06-29T13:00:37,"Bitcoin Consolidating Below $108,000 But Eyes $115,000 Target","Bitcoin’s price action has been relatively stable in recent days, currently trading just above $107,000 after briefly touching previous highs near $108,000. Amid this backdrop, technical analysis from a popular crypto analyst on the TradingView platform outlined a compelling structural setup forming on Bitcoin’s daily chart. The analysis shows that Bitcoin’s action is in a compression phase that could precede a breakout to $115,000 very soon. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Compression Structure Forming Below $108,000 Resistance Bitcoin’s price action is currently following movements in traditional risk assets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which have recovered following the recent de-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst RLinda shared an outlook on TradingView that highlights a structural setup forming on the D1 chart and predicts a breakout to as high as $115,000 if some resistance levels are cleared. According to RLinda, Bitcoin is in the middle of a compression phase just below the $108,100 resistance level. This follows what the analyst describes as a false breakout above $100,000, which led to a brief distribution and now an active accumulation zone. The daily chart shows price action gradually tightening within the $106,500 to $108,100 range since June 25, the essence of which the analyst called a pause for a breather before a possible continuation of growth. The current setup has already established well-defined boundaries, with support at $106,500 and $108,100 as immediate resistance. A breakout above this immediate resistance would pave the way for the next resistance around $110,400 and bring Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high at $111,000. On the other hand, a short-term pullback toward $105,650 is still possible before a new move to the upside. Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch Bitcoin’s price action is really pressing on this resistance level around $108,000 and is building momentum for a breakout once the price level gives way. The key resistance levels to monitor are stacked around $108,100, $108,900, and $110,400. As long as the structure between $106,500 and $108,100 holds, and Bitcoin’s price is sticky near the top of that zone, the breakout scenario becomes increasingly probable. Although there are currently no reasons for a decline on the daily and weekly candlestick charts, the analyst noted that a temporary pullback to $105,650 or even $104,650 cannot be ruled out. However, even such a pullback would likely only serve as a retest but still keep the broader setup intact.

2025-06-29T13:00:29,"Bitcoin In Stalemate With Liquidation Traps On Both Sides Of The Market","Bitcoin prices climbed by 5.07% in the past week to hit a local peak of $108,000 before experiencing a solid rejection. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has remained in the $106,000 – $107,000 range showing no indications of a breakout in either market direction. Amidst this market consolidation, renowned crypto analyst with X username KillaXBT has highlighted the key liquidation zones in the present Bitcoin market structure that are critical to the next significant price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Bitcoin: Clustering At $103K–$106K And $108K–$111K – What Could This Mean? In a recent X post , KillaXBT shares that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal decision zone as liquidation heatmap data from Coinglass reveals notable liquidity clusters forming on both ends of the current price range. The market expert explains that BTC is trapped between long and short liquidation zones in both low and high time frames (L/HTF) signaling a moment of market indecision On the 7-day chart (LTF), KillaXBT states there are accumulations of long positions between $103,400 and $106,000. This data suggests that a move below this price range could trigger cascading stop-losses and force liquidations, sending Bitcoin prices lower in a short-term decline. On the other hand, there are also liquidity clusters in the $108,000–$109,000 region, indicating the presence of potentially significant short positions. A breakout above $109,000 could initiate a sharp short squeeze, perhaps driving prices higher toward the current all-time high in the $111,000 price range. Using the 30-day chart (HTF), KillaXBT provides more information on the Bitcoin market stalemate. The analyst notes that more short-side liquidations are clustered between $108,300 and $109,000 than long-side liquidations between $103,000 and $106,000. However, the presence of short positions at $111,000 presents a scenario where bulls could reclaim control if they successfully push past this upper resistance. Ultimately, KillaXBT concludes the current BTC market structure suggests a delicate balance with high-leverage positions stacked both above and below current prices. The market expert warns that traders refrain from engaging the market until the highlighted liquidation zones are tested.

Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Sentora reports that Bitcoin’s weekly network fees totaled $3.39 million, marking a 38.9% decline from the previous week. Despite this drop in on-chain activity, exchange outflows of $310 million suggest a strong market confidence, as investors increasingly move their assets into private wallets, typically a sign of long-term holding intent.

2025-06-29T12:56:26,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Investors Enter Holding Pattern – Could This Propel BTC Higher?","Bitcoin is holding above $107,000 as traders digest mixed macro signals. The latest US core PCE data, the Fed’s preferred gauge, came in at 2.7% year-over-year in May, above the expected 2.6%. Core PCE rose 0.2% month over month, while headline PCE only rose 0.1%, indicating sticky inflation. This supports the Fed’s cautious tone on rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell advised being patient in upcoming decisions, citing inflation risks, including potential tariffs imposed by former President Trump. Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin is showing resilience, above $106,000, while other risk assets are showing stress. There is no significant selling pressure even after hotter inflation numbers, so market participants are in a wait-and-see mode, waiting for further macro developments or confirmation of a technical breakout. Metaplanet Doubles Down on BTC Institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains, as Japanese firm Metaplanet doubles down on its strategy. The company raised $300M in zero-coupon bonds to accelerate its Bitcoin-only acquisition plan, reaffirming a bold long-term vision under CEO Simon Gerovich. Recent filings indicate that Metaplanet purchased 1,111 BTC during the recent dip, to accumulate 21,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This is similar to MicroStrategy’s model but takes it further—Metaplanet isn’t just integrating Bitcoin, it’s building its entire corporate thesis around it. $300M raised for BTC purchases 1,111 BTC added during market dip Target: 21,000 BTC by 2026, 210,000 BTC by 2027 Bitcoin is Metaplanet’s only treasury asset The company’s strategy could mark the beginning of a new wave of corporate adoption as its single-asset approach gains traction in Japan and abroad. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Consolidation Signals Breakout On the technical front , BTC/USD is approaching a breakout after a week of consolidation.

Price is testing the $108,980 ceiling with a bullish engulfing candle and support from the 50-EMA.

MACD is positive so momentum could return if volume comes in to support the next move. A close above $108,980 would likely lead to a test of $110,448 and then $111,944. Bitcoin Price Chart- Source: Tradingview Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: Long above $109,000 (confirmed breakout) Targets: $110,448 and $111,944 Stop: Below $106,450 Alternatively, rejection at resistance could lead to a re-entry around $106,450 if buyers defend the mid-range. Until a clear breakout occurs, the Bitcoin price prediction signals a neutral bias in the short run, but a bullish structure is intact.

2025-06-29T12:45:45,"Central Banks Reveal ‘Doubts’ About US Dollar Following Geopolitical Tensions – Here’s Which Currencies They’re Shifting Toward","A new survey of central banks suggests growing skepticism about the future of the US dollar and its role in the global economy. Analysts from the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) – an independent think tank organization concerned with central banking, economic policy and public investment – say there is a global shift away from the dollar and into other currencies, primarily the euro and the renminbi. In the 2025 edition of its Global Public Investor report, which surveys 75 central banks around the world, OMFIF says there are clearly “growing questions over the dollar’s dominance in portfolios and public investors are seeking safe-haven assets.” The survey notes that lately, euros have outshined dollars and among emerging markets, the renminbi has surfaced as a new favorite. “The dollar is the only currency where net demand has fallen among central banks this year. This is attributable to rising concerns about the US political environment, highlighted by 70% of respondents, up from 31% last year, as well as geopolitics and US fiscal risks. The caution extends to global public funds – more than half think that US market exceptionalism will end.” However, OMFIF notes that the dollar’s reserve currency status is not yet under threat, given that 80% of central banks surveyed said that the dollar still provides safety and liquidity, and that the “vast majority” expect the greenback to constitute over 50% of global reserves over the next decade. Rather than a rapid “de-dollarization,” central banks are anticipating a “gradual currency diversification,” according to the report. As to what’s driving the move away from the dollar, according to the survey, the US political environment under the Trump administration is “directly leading to doubts about the dollar.” “This factor was selected by 70% of respondents as a discouraging factor for investing in dollar assets, more than double from a year ago. Linked to the recent political shift is the move towards trade protection and broader geopolitical uncertainty – which 60% flagged as an issue, up from 32% last year. Concerns about the fiscal outlook have also increased, with one central bank in Europe mentioning, ‘we are mindful of potential risks stemming from US fiscal imbalances’.” Read the full report here .

2025-06-29T12:26:24,"More than one in four working age South Koreans are invested in digital assets","Over 25% of South Koreans aged 20 to 50 now hold digital assets, with crypto accounting for 14% of their overall financial portfolios, according to a new report by the Hana Institute of Finance. According to the report, 31% of crypto ownership is held by investors in their 40s, 28% in their 30s, and 25% by persons in their 50s, narrowing the age gap between crypto ownership to 22%. Most investors between 50 and 59, 78%, said they invest in crypto as a means of wealth accumulation on their side, and 53% are using it to save towards retirement. The interest is not diminishing either, as 70% of all respondents wanted to invest more in crypto. Traditional financial institutions ‘ role and more robust legal protection were cited as having a role in raising confidence. Current crypto users are dominated by white-collar men in their 30s and 40s. The report , however, states that trading strategies are maturing. Frequent crypto purchases increased by 34% and medium-term activity increased by 47%. Short-term speculative trading marginally fell. Bitcoin leads, but users begin diversifying holdings Bitcoin is still the most popular, as six out of ten investors own BTC . However, with increased experience, most are venturing into altcoins and stablecoins. NFTs and security tokens are still unpopular, as nine out of ten investors prefer to keep only coin investments. Banking restrictions became a major problem. Seven in ten investors said they would prefer their main bank for crypto transactions if allowed to link multiple accounts. Currently, South Korea only allows one bank account per exchange, which is very strict and limits user experience and flexibility. Youth unemployment in South Korea is currently high at 6.6%, more than double the national average. The increasing cost of housing and the overall lack of wage increases are pushing young Koreans into high-risk crypto investments. This contrasts with older investors, who increasingly appreciate crypto for conducting structured savings and long-term wealth planning. KB Kookmin Bank pushes forward with stablecoin filings Institutional action is picking up pace. Recently, South Korea-based KB Kookmin Bank submitted 17 trademarks potentially related to a future stablecoin product, including designations such as KBKRW and KRWST. Both filings were filed with the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Services and cover software for virtual currency and blockchain-based systems. These trademarks are part of the bank’s wider plans to develop a national stablecoin consortium. KB is among eight big banks planning a joint venture to issue won-pegged stablecoins . The effort is coordinated with Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute and the Open Blockchain and Decentralised Identifier Association. Such steps correspond to the political shift with President Lee Jae-myung, whose government is likely to accelerate the institutional adoption of crypto. Although crypto was not featured in his inauguration speech, the Democratic Party Digital Asset Committee plans to push regulatory reforms and integrate crypto into the financial system. Lee will be in charge of significant crypto policies in South Korea, such as the possible implementation of the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA). This move started with Yoon, who had campaigned on it but could not witness it to completion since he was relieved early. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Since the presale began some months ago, it has moved at an unprecedented speed, reaching a total raise of nearly $16 million in no time. The early presale success reflects investors’ strong interest in Remittix, especially as top cryptocurrencies like BTC and XRP have been moving sideways in recent weeks. For Remittix, the broader crypto sentiment has only caused more attention. More investors are diversifying their portfolios with the new altcoin and the earliest adopters have already made about 500x gains. Regarding its long-term possibilities, experts have predicted that Remittix could do 1,000% gains or more in 2025, especially after the project kicks off officially and the RTX token gets listed on reputable crypto exchanges. Bitcoin’s institutional investors remain unfazed Despite the lingering bearish trend in the crypto market, the BTC price has maintained an average price of around $106K over the past month. Even the massive dip from the global tensions could not hold the BTC price from moving back to the green zone. The doggedness seen in the BTC price movement is largely a result of the continuous purchase of Bitcoin by institutions.

RTX could outshine BTC and XRP in 2025 Due to the slow upward movement in the BTC price, more retail investors are turning to altcoins like XRP for portfolio diversification. The interest in XRP stems from its big status in the crypto payment space, as businesses and individuals now leverage XRP for superfast cross-border payments at extremely low costs. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the XRP price shows similar slow growth to BTC. For context, XRP has been stuck around $2 for the past few months. Conversely, RTX is soaring and is now believed to be poised for the biggest gains compared to BTC and XRP in 2025. The massive jump in the RTX price would be fueled by its demand by businesses using the Remittix Pay API to process cross-border payments for their products and services. Plus, individuals sending money worldwide will also need RTX to spread love to their friends and families who can get the payment directly in their bank accounts and convert to 30+ fiat currencies in one place. Conclusion With Remittix’s promising outlook, now is the best time to buy RTX at $0.0781 before it reaches its $18 million soft cap value and explodes.

2025-06-29T12:08:27,"Monster $1.4 billion Bitcoin short squeeze alert","Bitcoin ( BTC ) appears poised for a significant short squeeze as it edges toward the $110,000 mark and potentially a new all-time high. Specifically, there is a notable buildup of short positions near $119,000 across exchanges like Bybit, OKX, and Binance. If Bitcoin continues its upward move, as much as $1.4 billion in shorts could be liquidated, triggering a potential short squeeze, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Coinglass on June 29. Bitcoin exchange liquidation map. Source: Coinglass The liquidation map shows rising short leverage even as long exposure declines, signaling imbalance. Therefore, a breakout above $110,000 could act as a catalyst, forcing shorts to cover and pushing prices higher. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s recent rally has been fueled in part by easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. To this end, analysts suggest that the rebound may lead to a new all-time high, potentially in the coming week if momentum holds. Bitcoin signals more bullish momentum Adding to the bullish setup, analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X post on June 28 that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is nearing a golden cross with its 30-day simple moving average ( SMA ).

Notably, the MVRV Ratio measures how over- or undervalued Bitcoin is relative to holders’ cost basis. A crossover above the 30-day SMA typically indicates strengthening sentiment and inflow of capital. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $108,190, up 0.8% in 24 hours and 2.4% on the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the same time, technical indicators support the bullish case. Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day SMA of $105,901, while the 200-day SMA at $87,663 confirms a strong long-term uptrend. The 14-day RSI stands at 55.89, indicating a neutral but supportive stance for continued upside.

2025-06-29T12:06:22,"Crypto News Digest: BlackRock Eyes Altcoin ETFs, $1.24B Inflows, Bolivia’s Bitcoin Surge","The past week has seen pivotal developments across the crypto industry, from institutional momentum to global adoption surges. Here is a concise round-up of the most important developments shaping the digital asset landscape brought to you by Outset PR, a crypto-native PR firm that pioneers a new niche of public relations through a data-driven approach. BlackRock Eyes Broader Crypto ETF Horizons BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is weighing an expansion of its crypto ETF lineup beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is evaluating funds tied to Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) and Solana (SOL), in a move that would mark a significant shift toward broader digital asset exposure. The deliberations come amid rising institutional appetite for tokenized assets and decentralized network infrastructure. While no formal product has been announced, industry analysts say such offerings could boost liquidity and legitimize second-tier cryptocurrencies in the eyes of traditional investors. The move echoes BlackRock’s broader strategy to deepen its presence in the digital finance sector, following its successful Bitcoin ETF rollout earlier this year. Crypto Investment Products See $1.24 Billion in Weekly Inflows Digital asset investment vehicles attracted $1.24 billion in net inflows last week, led by continued demand for Bitcoin ETFs. The data, released by CoinShares , suggests that institutional investors remain net buyers despite heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin accounted for the bulk of inflows, reaffirming its status as the sector’s bellwether. Analysts view the capital movement as a signal of confidence in the long-term viability of crypto assets, particularly among firms seeking inflation hedges and portfolio diversification. The figures mark one of the strongest weekly showings for crypto funds in 2025, underscoring a renewed sense of risk-on sentiment among large capital allocators. Bolivia’s Crypto Transactions Surge 530% Amid Currency Woes In a sign of rising grassroots adoption, Bolivia recorded a 530% increase in cryptocurrency transactions, according to new data from regional exchanges and blockchain analytics firms. The surge comes as the country struggles with inflationary pressures, currency controls, and limited access to formal banking services. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly being used for remittances, savings, and peer-to-peer commerce, particularly among urban youth and small businesses. The trend reflects a broader shift in emerging markets, where digital assets are gaining traction as financial lifelines. Bolivia’s rapid adoption mirrors similar patterns seen in Argentina, Venezuela and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results As digital assets evolve from speculation to real value, so must the way crypto firms tell their stories. Outset PR , a specialized Web3 communications agency, is reshaping how PR is executed in this sector by turning media visibility into verifiable growth. Outset PR replaces vague promises with performance-driven planning, leveraging retrospective data and real-time metrics to time publications, tailor narratives, and calibrate campaign outreach to business outcomes. Clients know exactly where their story will land, when it will break, and what results to expect. Unlike mass-blast agencies, Outset delivers PR strategies customized for each client’s growth stage, budget, and market focus. The secret lies in its proprietary traffic acquisition stack, which fuses organic editorial coverage with SEO-optimized, lead-generating distribution. The firm’s in-house analytics desk monitors crypto media performance across factors like domain activity, audience geography, and visibility trends providing actionable insights that fuel smarter outreach. Bottom Line Institutional and retail crypto adoption are advancing in parallel. While asset managers like BlackRock explore deeper forays into alternative tokens, individuals in unstable economies are accelerating real-world usage. With capital flows returning to the sector and geopolitical conditions driving demand, crypto’s utility story may soon rival its investment narrative. And as the stakes rise, so does the need for sharper communication. Outset PR’s integrated approach—blending storytelling with traffic acquisition and market intel—gives Web3 companies a powerful lens through which to define their public presence.

2025-06-29T11:47:10,"Bitcoin Offers Protection Against Authoritarian Regimes, Says Human Rights Foundation Executive","Bitcoin is proving to be a powerful tool for resisting authoritarian financial control, offering individuals an alternative to the risks of manipulated fiat currencies, according to a senior Human Rights Foundation (HRF) executive. Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Alex Gladstein, HRF’s chief strategy officer, emphasized BTC’s role in protecting citizens against oppressive regimes. “With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to do these things is completely decimated,” Gladstein said, describing BTC as “bad for dictators.” Bitcoin Shields Individuals From Hyperinflation Addressing what he described as a “hall full of American leaders,” Gladstein explained that Bitcoin, when used correctly and without linking to personal identities, becomes much harder for governments to track. This makes it difficult for authorities to freeze or seize funds, a common tactic used by authoritarian regimes to control their populations. Gladstein emphasized that those who self-custody their BTC are shielded from tactics often used by dictators, including asset freezes and hyperinflation. “If you’re self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you,” he stated, underlining BTC’s value as a hedge during periods of hyperinflation and economic instability . He added that BTC has already helped many people in countries facing authoritarian control, describing it as a technology that has “saved or rescued” lives by providing financial freedom. Ukraine’s Pro-Democracy Movement Gladstein recounted how the HRF first recognized BTC’s potential during Ukraine’s 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Many activists involved in the demonstrations, which would later evolve into the Maidan Square movement, faced frozen bank accounts as they organized for democratic reforms. “This was very early in Bitcoin’s life cycle; Bitcoin was worth like a hundred bucks at the time; we were very skeptical that this would work,” Gladstein said, reflecting on HRF’s cautious yet open-minded approach to using BTC. Despite uncertainties, the HRF proceeded with Bitcoin , successfully delivering funds to activists when traditional financial channels were blocked. “It got the value to them where traditional money couldn’t go,” Gladstein noted. Since joining HRF in 2007, he has focused on advancing human rights globally, particularly in regions under authoritarian rule, positioning BTC as a vital tool for protecting financial freedom.

2025-06-29T11:45:33,"Rallies Unlike Anything the Market Has Seen About To Kick Off for Crypto, According to Analyst","A closely followed crypto analyst is predicting a historic rally for altcoin markets based on an unprecedented technical setup. The pseudonymous analyst known as TechDev shares a chart with his 532,000 followers on the social media platform X showing the price action of TOTAL2 – which tracks the total market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and stablecoins – with a Bollinger Band indicator. Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to assess price volatility and identify potential breakout or mean-reversion opportunities. When the bands are close together, it suggests that volatility is historically low and the asset is potentially due for a big move. According to TechDev, the Bollinger Bands are tightly contracted for TOTAL2, suggesting that a huge burst to the upside for altcoins is imminent. “Altcoin compression is at a record high. Expansion will be unlike anything the market has seen.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst also believes that, based on the overall business cycle, Bitcoin is nowhere near its top. “Re-evaluate your top calls.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for investor risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, according to TechDev. “The steep part lies ahead.” Source: TechDev/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,165, up 4% in the last seven days.
