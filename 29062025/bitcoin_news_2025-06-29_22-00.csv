Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election.

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K.

2025-06-29T19:05:08,"Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released – Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends","The “2050 Generation Virtual Asset Investment Trends Report” published by Hana Financial Research Institute revealed that virtual asset investment in South Korea has become a serious financial asset rather than a speculative tool. According to the report, 27% of individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 invest in cryptocurrencies, and these investments constitute an average of 14% of their total financial assets. The research is based on survey results conducted with 1,000 people. The crypto ownership rate is at its highest level, with 31% among individuals in their 40s. 70% of investors state that they plan to increase their crypto investments in the future. Another noteworthy piece of data from the report is that more than half of investors in their 50s are holding crypto for retirement preparation. 78% of this age group stated that they invested in virtual assets for the purpose of creating large savings, and 53% directly for old age preparation. Related News: A Turning Point for Cryptocurrencies: Solana and Ethereum ETFs with Staking Could Soon Begin Trading While 79% of investors use crypto to “grow money,” only 24% say they invest for “fashion and entertainment,” and 22% say they invest for “daily living expenses.” This suggests that crypto is now being viewed as a serious portfolio asset. Behaviors towards crypto investments are also maturing. The proportion of regular investors increased from 10% to 34%, while the proportion of medium-term investors increased from 26% to 47%. The proportion of short-term investors decreased from 48% to 45%. While 90% of investors stated that they only hold coins, interest in new generation digital assets such as NFTs and security tokens remained low. 60% of investors who hold an average of two different coins include Bitcoin in their portfolios. Initially focused on Bitcoin, investment strategies have expanded over time with altcoin and stablecoin diversity. The biggest complaint from investors was the inability to establish a connection between exchanges and existing bank accounts. Under the current system, exchanges can only be assigned a single bank account. 70% of participants said they would prefer their main bank if this restriction was lifted. Market volatility (56%), stock market risk (61%) and fraud concerns (61%) still significantly influence investment decisions. However, investors see the more active role of traditional financial institutions (42%) and increased regulation (35%) as positive steps. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Yardeni predicts that the US stock market will surge to new all-time highs amid an improving macroeconomic picture. “I think we’re still very much in a bull market… I think the market is going to go higher because I think the economy is going to prove resilient. It has shown some weakness of late, but that’s really old data, data that is in response to all the uncertainties, and I think a lot of the uncertainties have dissipated. Clearly, [the trade war] is not a done issue yet, but I think it will be by the end of the summer.” The market strategist also notes that risk assets like stocks have a history of climbing a “wall of worry,” rallying even as most investors are sidelined amid fear, uncertainty and doubt. “There’s always risk, clearly, in the market, and things to be concerned about. Sometimes the market goes up best when everybody is worried. What’s interesting is here we are basically at a record high, and a lot of the sentiment indicators are still very wary, very cautious. You’re not seeing a lot of bullishness in the sentiment indicators. So that’s a good thing. That suggests that people just really haven’t bought into this recovery from the correction.” On Friday, the S&P 500 closed the trading day at 6,173 points – a new all-time high.

2025-06-29T19:00:16,"Strategy Exec Launches Massive MSTR Selling Spree","Some executives of the American business intelligence and software firm Strategy Inc. have decided to sell their MSTR shares instead. Some filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shown massive insider trading of the shares within the last three months. Strategy CEO Still Holds a Big MSTR Bag According to the filings, Strategy CEO Phong Le launched an MSTR selling spree during this period, with sales of over $14 million worth of shares recorded. This fund covers 8,400 shares of Class A common stock, sold on June 18 from his holdings. There were other transactions by VP & CAO Montgomery Jeanine, EVP & General Counsel Shao Wei-Ming, EVP & CFO Kang Andrew, Directors Carl Rickertsen and Patten Jarrod. Even after the offload transaction from Phong’s account, the Strategy executive still personally owns 16,390 shares of the same stock. Not only does he own a significant number of Class A common stock, but Phong also holds 6,000 and 4,500 shares of two different series of preferred stock (“Strife” and “Stride”). Selling Pressure? MSTR Remains in the Clear A significant number of MSTR holders have argued that this selling spree is rather a routine practice. Still, it is not surprising that some other crypto enthusiasts are wondering what this insider trading means for MSTR. While there is no specific response to this probe, it is worth noting that the selling spree is not a sure sign of a lack of confidence. For now, the sums are not significant enough to trigger any alarm or signal severe selling pressure. The company had recently purchased an additional 245 Bitcoin units at a cost of around $26 million. Its Bitcoin holdings are now approximately 592,345 BTC. Strategy Faces Class Action Lawsuits Over Bitcoin Meanwhile, Strategy has been sued for making misleading statements about Bitcoin, as well as the company’s business, operations, and prospects. About five law firms filed their identical class action lawsuits against the business intelligence software firm. Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, claimed that “the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated.” Strategy was further accused of understating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility, in addition to failing to reveal the magnitude of losses Strategy could incur on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08.

According to a new press release by the Department of Justice (DOJ), 39-year-old Oluwaseun Adekoya, who resides in New Jersey, has been convicted of bank fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and nine counts of aggravated identity theft for masterminding the plot. Authorities say that Adekoya obtained public information regarding people’s home equity lines of credit (HELOC), identified those who had substantial amounts and then used encrypted messaging apps to find out private identifying information about his victims. Adekoya subsequently recruited “a vast web of managers” around the nation, shared the information with them and supplied them with fake identification cards so they could impersonate HELOC customers at banks and credit unions to withdraw funds from victims’ accounts. To avoid detection, Adekoya utilized a network of burner phones and used encrypted chat applications to pass key information. He also laundered funds through bank accounts under other people’s names. According to the press release, Adekoya has an extensive criminal rap sheet and has been convicted of fraud-related crimes numerous times since 2008. Authorities say they had been investigating Adekoya since May 2022. He and 13 others were indicted in December 2023, and all have since pleaded guilty. Federal agents seized Rolex watches, a $51,000 Tiffany engagement ring, designer handbags and shoes, as well as a bank account containing $26,000 from Adekoya. Adekoya’s sentencing is scheduled on October 30th, and he is facing a minimum of two years and a maximum of 32 years behind bars.

2025-06-29T18:00:52,"Bitcoin Retail Demand At 6-Month Low — But Institutional Investor Activity Keeps Rising","The price action of Bitcoin has been quite strong over the past week, exhibiting good signs of recovery from last weekend’s low. While the premier cryptocurrency travelled as high as $108,000 in the last few days, it is now hovering around the $107,000 mark. The latest on-chain data suggests that a group of investors has stayed out of the market despite the price resilience of Bitcoin in recent months. BTC Retail Demand Falls By 10% In June: Analyst In a June 28 post on social media platform Z, on-chain analyst Maartunn revealed that a cohort of market participants known as retail investors has been relatively inactive over the past few months. This on-chain revelation is based on the Retail Investor Demand metric, which estimates the demand for BTC amongst small-scale investors. In essence, this on-chain metric tracks the activity of small wallets typically involved in transfers of small sizes. Specifically, this Retail Investor Demand indicator measures the percentage change in the cumulative volume of small transactions (worth $10,000 or less) over a 30-day period. In the chart highlighted by Maartunn, the 30-day change in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand plunged into the negative territory and has remained in the red since early June. More recently, the metric fell to the 10% level, which represents the lowest level in more than six months. Considering that the Bitcoin price action has been fairly steady in this period, it is quite surprising that small-scale investors have refrained from entering the market. The market seems to be rather dominated by institutional investors — primarily through the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Institutional And Bitcoin ETF Investors Take Charge This trend of falling retail demand was also spotlighted by on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci on the X platform, saying that institutional investors and spot ETF investors seem to currently have a strong appetite for accumulating Bitcoin. In the past week, the US-based BTC exchange-traded funds posted a significant weekly total net inflow of $2.2 billion. Furthermore, Kesmeci mentioned that if the decline in retail demand continues, it could mean that the Bitcoin price is nearing a bottom. Hence, the flagship cryptocurrency could enjoy some bullish momentum and upward price movement over the coming weeks. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,244, reflecting a mere 0.1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by more than 4% on the weekly timeframe.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-retail-investor-demand-at-6-month-low/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Retail Demand|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T18:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: Bitcoin, Sui, Sonic","All eyes are on Sui this week as the Layer-1 blockchain prepares for a major token unlock that could reshape its near-term price action. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) flirts with a breakout past $107,000 and ETF inflows near $50 billion, Sui ( SUI ) is drawing heightened scrutiny ahead of its July 1 unlock of 5.22 billion tokens—worth over $154 million, or 1.63% of total supply. This recurring monthly event, scheduled to continue through 2030, has become a significant driver of volatility. Technical indicators point to further downside as SUI trades below its 50-day moving average within a descending channel. With the price hovering near the $2 support level, traders are bracing for movement. Meanwhile, broader market sentiment remains mixed as macro data, including U.S. nonfarm payrolls and trade updates, loom. Sonic ( S ) is also in focus ahead of the latest U.S. nonfarm payroll data, to be released on July 3.

Data shows that Bitcoin ETF inflows jumped by over $2.2 billion last week, its third consecutive week of gains. This growth resulted in cumulative inflows of nearly $50 billion. Technical indicators suggest that the Bitcoin price is eyeing a bullish breakout to its all-time high, which may occur this week. It has formed a bullish flag and a cup-and-handle pattern, which often leads to more gains. The distance between the upper side and the lower side of the cup is about 30%. Measuring the same distance from its upper side brings the target to about $145,000. Such a move will likely trigger a new crypto market bull run .

Sui price at risk as a big unlock nears Meanwhile, Sui, a top layer-2 network, will be in the spotlight as the Sui Foundation unlocks 5.22 billion tokens worth over $154 million, or 1.63% of the total supply. Sui has a maximum supply limit of 10 billion tokens and a circulation of 3.39 billion. It unlocks over 55 million tokens on the first of every month, a trend that will continue until 2030. Technicals show that the SUI price has moved below the 50-day moving average and has formed a descending channel. Therefore, the price may continue falling as traders eye the support at $2 ahead of the unlock event.

Sonic price prepares for a token unlock Sonic, formerly known as Fantom, has been in a downtrend, with its token falling by 705 from its highest point this year. The main catalyst for the Sonic price will be on Thursday, when the network unlocks tokens worth over $73.7 million, representing 7.50% of the total float. Sonic has a circulating supply of 2.88 billion against a total supply of 3.17 billion. S price chart | Source: crypto.news The 12-hour chart shows that the Sonic price has crashed from the year-to-date high of $0.9833 to the current $0.3166. It recently moved below the support at $0.3810, the lowest swing on April 8. It remains below the 50-period moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the support at $0.20.

2025-06-29T17:30:59,"Coinbase (COIN) Shares Outperform S&P 500 Stocks","In the latest publication of The Kobeissi Letter, shares of Coinbase (COIN) recorded a significant spike. Moreover, the publicly-listed stock outperformed the broader market, including the other shares in the S&P 500. This June, COIN rose by 43%, surpassing the other shares to become the top performer in the S&P 500. GENIUS Act Impacts Positively on Coinbase Stock Performance The 43% surge pushed COIN to its highest level ever since its public debut in 2021. The spike is largely attributed to a shift in investor focus towards stablecoin revenue, triggered by Washington’s progress on the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) has recently rallied to over $108,600, gradually inching towards its previously held all-time high (ATH). This outlook is likely fueled by the series of positive institutional news entering the market. One of such is JPMorgan’s trademark application for digital asset services. Purpose Investments is also planning to launch a spot XRP ETF in Canada but is still awaiting regulatory approval from the appropriate authorities. Market Strength Remains Primarily Tied to BTC Even Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard acknowledged that the market strength is still primarily tied to BTC’s performance. As a result, he does not see the nearing of an ‘alt season’, even with altcoins like Ripple-associated XRP and Chainlink (LINK), registering strong gains. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC price is currently at $108,093.73, following a 0.88% spike in the last 24 hours. Already, Bitfinex analysts have projected that if BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 support zone, it could signal that a local bottom has formed. Additionally, Swissblock analysts anticipate significant volatility driven by Fed Chair Powell’s remarks during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Ark Invest Offloads COIN Shares Although COIN has recently registered remarkable growth, a few companies may have missed out on it. On June 26, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest offloaded shares from major fintech firms, including Coinbase. Precisely, the company sold more than $24 million worth of shares from Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. At the time, the US crypto market was displaying signs of strength and growing regulatory clarity, which caused COIN to reach an all-time high (ATH).

2025-06-29T17:28:49,"Trump Backs Bitcoin in Latest White House Speech – Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Bull Run","In Friday’s White House press conference, Donald Trump yet again declared his support for Bitcoin, calling it ‘amazing’ and pointing out its growing use in the economy. It has become amazing. I mean, it is the jobs that it produces, and I notice more and more you pay in Bitcoin. People are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country. – Donald Trump in latest White House speech In this article, we’ll quickly touch upon Trump’s latest pro-crypto comments, how they could spark another altcoin rally, and what the best crypto to buy is if you wish to capitalize on the momentum before the next leg up. Trump Says Bitcoin is Relieving Dollar Strain Easily the most notable piece of Trump’s speech was his claim that Bitcoin is relieving pressure off the US dollar. This is ‘ a much more significant statement than what it seems at first glance ,’ says digital asset researcher Anders. According to Anders, Trump’s comment suggests he understands the ‘Triffin dilemma,’ which is a long-standing economic paradox, and that he’s probably keen on using crypto to solve it. The Triffin dilemma is the term used to describe the conflict faced by the country (in this case, the USA) whose currency (the US dollar) serves as the world’s reserve currency. The ‘dilemma’ is that while the US dollar becomes stronger by boosting its global demand, this very strength then widens the country’s trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes imports cheaper and exports become more expensive. Using a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin – or XRP, which is a more ‘US-made’ crypto than $BTC – could help ease pressure on USD. If investments flow in the form of $BTC rather than $USD, it would reduce demand for the dollar, weakening it and, therefore, correcting the trade deficit. All in all, Trump’s renewed endorsement adds momentum to the crypto narrative. It positions Bitcoin (and potentially other tokens) as a genuinely strategic financial tool. With that in mind, here are a few cryptos that could benefit from Bitcoin’s latest tap on the shoulder. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best cryptos to invest in right now because, first and foremost, it’s the ONLY one offering free $BTC to its token holders. Buy $BTCBULL and store it in Best Wallet , and whenever Bitcoin crosses $150K and $200K for the first time, you’ll automatically receive your share of free $BTC. Additionally, holding BTC Bull Token will also beef up your crypto portfolio. That’s because the token is predicted to surge 277% and reach $0.0096 by 2026 . One $BTCBULL is currently priced at just $0.00258, and the project has in total raised over $7.6M (and counting) in early investor funding. Another reason for this new crypto’s potential bright future is its token burn mechanism. Simply put, the developers will shave off a part of the total token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. This will create artificial scarcity and upward price pressure, especially during Bitcoin bull runs. It’s a clever way of aligning the token’s growth with Bitcoin’s momentum. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Putting the Bitcoin Blockchain on Steroids Bitcoin is undoubtedly the OG crypto and blockchain, but it wasn’t really built with Web3 adoption in mind. It only processes seven transactions per second, as opposed to Solana’s 2K-3K TPS. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This new meme coin on presale aims to build the first-ever Layer 2 on Bitcoin that will directly tackle the problems of scalability and programmability on the network. By leveraging a Canonical Bridge and integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it will convert your $BTC from a traditional L1 asset into a high-speed, scalable L2 asset. You’ll be able to use this ‘wrapped’ Bitcoin on L2 for lightning-fast payments and swaps, as well as lending and staking on DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps. Also, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could be the next crypto to explode . It could reach $0.253 by 2030 – a nearly 2,000% gain from current prices . $HYPER is currently in presale, which is why you can buy it for a low price of $0.012075. Even though the presale is fresh out of the oven, it has amassed a chunky $1.7M so far. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Useless Coin ($USELESS) – Viral New Meme Coin with No Intrinsic Value or Utility Useless Coin ($USELESS) is the newest and perhaps the perfect epitome of what meme coins truly stand for: community-driven degen fun without any real utility or intrinsic value. With no staking, governance mechanisms, or revenue generation outside liquidity fees, $USELESS is almost a satirical take on all the other so-called utility tokens flooding the market right now. It launched just over a couple of weeks ago and has already gained over 92%. Currently trading at $0.1665 , $USELESS is hitting new all-time highs as we speak, so this might be a good time to get in. Wrapping Up With Donald Trump’s latest remarks on Bitcoin signaling renewed support for the crypto world, high-potential newcomers like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) can surge big time. That said, keep in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky.

This significant change aims to increase the network’s transaction speed, improve response time, and strengthen the performance of all ecosystem components. The Maxwell upgrade is the implementation of three key proposals, BEP-524, BEP-563 and BEP-564. Each of these proposals aims to further enhance the speed and reliability aspects of the BSC. With the new update: Block time will be reduced from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds. Communication between validators will be improved. Block synchronization between nodes will be accelerated. These improvements will benefit all network participants, including users, developers, validators, and node operators. Related News: How Much Bitcoin Does Elon Musk Currently Hold?

2025-06-29T16:50:12,"Crypto Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Set to Outperform Bitcoin – Early Investors Positioned for Massive Gains","In every bull run, there’s that one project. The one people talk about for years. For many, Bitcoin was that moment in 2011. But in 2025, a new name is being whispered in all the right corners. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris. And if you blink, you might just miss it. While the crypto space is constantly buzzing with new launches and flashy tokens, few manage to combine technical brilliance, real-world utility, and the raw energy of a community ready to take flight. Bitcoin Solaris is positioning itself not just as another blockchain but as a wealth engine, engineered with speed, security, and scalability at its core. Bitcoin Was the Spark. Solaris Is the Flame. Bitcoin changed the financial world, but even the most loyal BTC holders know it wasn’t built for today’s pace. Slow block times and high fees are no longer charming relics, they’re limitations. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in . BTC-S brings the legacy of Bitcoin’s security and fuses it with modern performance. The result? A blockchain that delivers 10,000 transactions per second with finality in just two seconds. But this is not just about speed. It’s about structure. Bitcoin Solaris features a powerful dual-consensus mechanism that uses Proof of Work for base-layer security and Delegated Proof of Stake for execution efficiency. The two layers operate in harmony, ensuring decentralization and speed coexist. Core Features That Make BTC-S Unstoppable Here’s what sets Bitcoin Solaris apart in a market flooded with promises: Dual-layer architecture that separates execution from consensus for optimized performance. Hybrid consensus ensures validators rotate securely while preventing centralization. Energy-efficient mining algorithm adjusted for mobile and lower-power devices. Smart contract functionality that supports advanced DeFi use cases. Cross-chain bridge development in progress for seamless asset transfers. The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to mine using just a smartphone, unlocking massive global participation. And with over 12,800 users already onboard, the network effect is well underway. The Future of DeFi Doesn’t Run on Hype It Runs on BTC-S The Tokenomics Engine Fueling It All Scarcity, utility, and a long-term vision define the tokenomics behind BTC-S. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, the breakdown is engineered for fairness and sustainability: 66.66 percent for mining rewards 20 percent for presale 5 percent for liquidity pools 2 percent each for ecosystem, marketing, community rewards, and staking Just 0.33 percent for team and advisors This design ensures the majority of tokens go to participants, not insiders. Presale Power: Why Investors Are Rushing In With only around five weeks left, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is generating massive buzz. Currently in phase 9 at $9 per token, the price is quickly approaching the $20 launch mark. Over $5.6 million has already been raised and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Shortest presale in crypto history Over 12,800 users and counting Token Empire called it a “no-brainer” in a detailed video review Getting in early feels like catching Bitcoin at $1 except this time, there’s a roadmap and performance metrics to back it up. Users can buy tokens directly through Trust Wallet or MetaMask , making entry simple for both seasoned and new investors. A Miner’s Dream: Accessibility Meets Power Unlike traditional PoW systems that require warehouse-sized rigs, BTC-S mining is designed for everyone. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users will soon be able to mine on smartphones using an adaptive energy-efficient algorithm. This isn’t theoretical. A live calculator on the official site already allows users to estimate their mining potential. The mining architecture is also reinforced by smart validator rotation. This ensures fair distribution and participation while maintaining robust decentralization. The Audits Say It All For those who care about security Bitcoin Solaris is already audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , providing added trust during the presale and beyond. The team is also engaging with the community directly through Telegram and X , offering transparency and updates straight from the source. Final Verdict: This Is That Moment Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a project. It’s an opportunity. The kind that only comes once per cycle. With technical firepower, real adoption mechanics, and a presale model designed for maximum gain, it’s easy to see why early investors are already dreaming big. Missing early Bitcoin might haunt you. Catching Bitcoin Solaris at the right time might just be your redemption story.

2025-06-29T16:39:01,"The Rocket  Fueled: Bitcoin Supply Shock Incoming, Keiser Says","Bitcoin appears to be tightening its grip on market attention once again—this time not because of price volatility, but due to a looming structural scarcity that some of the asset’s most vocal supporters say is unfolding in real time. Max Keiser, Bitcoin advocate and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele , issued a clear statement on Tuesday, June 25, 2025, via his X account. “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” Keiser posted, punctuating the forecast with a rocket emoji. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of Bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins. According to blockchain data, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created. That number is falling fast. This event, part of Bitcoin’s four-year issuance schedule, cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As a result, the daily release of new coins dropped to approximately 450 BTC per day—down from around 900 before the halving. That drop in new supply arrives just as institutional demand shows no signs of easing. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional entities have poured billions into the asset. Data from early 2025 shows that ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have absorbed large volumes of BTC. As of June 2025, BlackRock leads all ETF issuers with substantial Bitcoin holdings, outpacing even Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which now controls over 500,000 BTC. In January 2024 after the ETF approvals, Samson Mow warned of a double-edged market pressure: a supply shock from the halving and a demand shock from ETF buying. His view now seems to be taking shape. Mow and Keiser argue that market liquidity could dry up fast when these forces collide. Trading volumes also support the idea of a supply shock. On June 24, Bitcoin trading volume exceeded $3 billion in just one hour. Such spikes indicate growing participation from institutions and retail investors alike, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value is also finding renewed interest amid global instability. The ongoing accumulation by large firms and new treasury entrants such as Metaplanet and ProCap BTC, recently co-founded by VC investor Anthony Pompliano, add weight to the notion that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset . On June 25, 2025, Keiser’s remarks will be accompanied by a broader analysis of the changing dynamics in Bitcoin supply and demand. Analysts point to a structural shift—less Bitcoin is being created and more is locked away in institutional vaults. That imbalance already affects availability on exchanges, where reserves continue to drop. Keiser and Mow’s predictions are not new, but the timeline may tighten. With less than five million Bitcoin left to mine, and the next halving set for 2028—when block rewards will fall again to 1.5625 BTC—the pressure on circulating supply may continue to intensify. For now, the data shows demand rising while supply falls. Whether that translates to market movement remains to be seen. But Bitcoin’s architecture ensures one thing: the supply side will not expand. As of late June 2025, that’s no longer just a theoretical talking point—it’s becoming visible on the blockchain.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-rocket-fueled-bitcoin-supply-shock-incoming-keiser-says/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T16:36:19,"Is Bitcoin Really Creating Jobs Like Trump Claims?","Bitcoin prices broke the $100,000 mark. President Donald Trump declared cryptocurrency “amazing” and praised it for “the jobs that it produces”. Trump has made a sharp U-turn, crediting Bitcoin for job growth and positioning the U.S. as a crypto leader. Trump’s remarks came at a White House news conference on June 27, 2025. He told reporters, “It’s become amazing … it’s the jobs that it produces.” The president even claimed credit for building a “crypto industry.” This follows months of pro-crypto actions by his administration, including new regulations and a push for a national Bitcoin reserve Trump argues that Bitcoin adoption is strategically vital and notes that crypto held up better than stocks in recent declines. But did Bitcoin really generate a significant wave of new U.S. jobs, as he claims? The U.S. civilian labor force is about 163 million, so 31,000 jobs are roughly 0.02% of all workers. By comparison, conventional industries add millions of jobs each year. Outside mining, the broader crypto industry — exchanges, fintech firms, and blockchain startups — also employs people, but comprehensive job tallies for those sectors are not readily available. Critics caution that Bitcoin’s benefits come with trade-offs. The group notes many crypto farms “fail to provide promised jobs” even as they pay low rates. Lawsuits over noise and pollution have followed rapid mining growth. Many Bitcoin mining jobs are technical roles (power technicians, engineers), often filled locally. Mining boosters highlight infrastructure and training investments in rural areas, but critics say those commitments do not always materialize. Trump’s job-creation claim has a basis, but it has important caveats. An April Perryman Group report confirms tens of thousands of U.S. jobs tied to Bitcoin mining, generating more than $4.1 billion in gross product annually for the U.S. economy. However, that is a very small slice of total U.S. employment. Those jobs are concentrated in a few energy-rich states and often rely on special power incentives. Analysts say the net economic impact must account for higher energy costs and community concerns.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/is-bitcoin-really-creating-jobs-like-trump-claims/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T16:29:52,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $7.24 Market cap $152.13M 24-hour trading volume $30.93M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $7.40 24-hour low $7.07 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 9.92% 50-day SMA $9.16 200-day SMA $16.52 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis On the day of writing (June 29), ORDI’s price rose by 2.25% in 24 hours and dropped 23.47% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume rose by 32.41% in 24 hours, as more traders positioned themselves in the bear market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms showing little market momentum. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 42.84. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is moving sideways with little volatility. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T16:29:51,"Glassnode: ETFs, Macro Trends, and $114 Billion Futures Boom Drive Bitcoin Liquidity","The transformation of Bitcoin (BTC) from speculative novelty to a cornerstone of global finance is gaining momentum, with more than $544 billion in fresh capital flooding the network since late 2022. A new report from Glassnode and Avenir Group has uncovered a “liquidity trifecta” of on-chain dynamics, market microstructure, and macro linkages underpinning the original cryptocurrency’s maturation as a standalone asset class. The $550 Million Daily Money Machine According to the analysis , Bitcoin’s evolution has become visible in its on-chain fundamentals. Since March 2023, those investing in the crypto asset have locked in profits amounting to about $550 million daily, signifying a deep, mature market where participants have serious conviction, taking gains, knowing the market is strong enough to absorb it. The survey also found the action was just as intense off-chain, with Bitcoin futures and options becoming the new playground for big money. Total open interest went from $11.1 billion in late 2022 to $114 billion during BTC’s historic charge past $100,000 at the beginning of 2025, a testament that institutions are not just dipping their toes, but are diving into crypto headfirst. Other key signs of institutional accumulation came from analyzing market microstructure tools such as the Limit Order Book (LOB), which brought to light sophisticated liquidity patterns. For example, before the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF approval, there was extreme sell-side pressure, which was replaced with a buy-side surge after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit the financial products. Similarly, Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) metrics exposed speculative vs. genuine demand, with Glassnode claiming that the current perpetual futures dominance suggests BTC’s latest rally is leaning speculative. Altcoins Get Left Behind The joint report also noted that Bitcoin’s sensitivity to macroeconomic forces has eclipsed its crypto-native cycles. Its price now moves tightly alongside the Global Liquidity Index (GLI) and traditional markets like the S&P 500, while moving against assets like the U.S. dollar. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have validated this macro alignment. While some critics had dismissed them as fleeting speculation when they were first introduced, Glassnode’s “unhedged demand” metric, which filters out arbitrage-driven flows, shows that they now represent genuine long-term institutional muscle. Meanwhile, the study revealed that altcoins are facing a liquidity crisis, with capital concentration mainly favoring Bitcoin and speculative meme coins on Solana. Per the data, in this cycle, funds going into altcoins dropped by a whopping $46 billion compared to the last boom. Ethereum, which once captured up to 65% of altcoin inflows, has since seen its share plummet to just 31%, with only Solana and XRP managing to outpace BTC. In Solana’s case, the uptick was fueled mainly by an explosion of meme coins, which saw their collective value shoot up 9,150% from $400 million to $37 billion. XRP has also had a wild ride of its own, with the anticipated resolution to a long-winded legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs over the token’s status, helping boost its value in the market on several occasions.

2025-06-29T16:21:23,"Texas is going Bitcoin: 3 tokens to stack as U.S. states embrace BTC reserves","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Texas funds $10m Bitcoin reserve, setting stage for altcoin surge as ETF hopes and investor momentum grow. The Lone Star State just put its stamp on the future of finance. Texas has officially become the first U.S. state to authorize and actively fund a publicly managed Bitcoin reserve, thanks to the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott. With $10 million allocated toward purchasing Bitcoin for the state treasury, the move is more than symbolic; it signals a broader institutional shift in how governments perceive and use digital assets. But here’s the real opportunity: Bitcoin’s rise is opening the door for several other cryptocurrencies to follow in its institutional footsteps, especially as ETF approval odds skyrocket for assets like Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP. Behind the scenes, regulatory clarity is catching up, and analysts are calling this the next major green light for the altcoin market. For investors looking to front-run the next leg up, three standout tokens are gaining serious momentum, including a surprise meme-chain play under $0.002 that could eclipse them all. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Little Pepe: The memecoin building a blockchain movement Texas may be going all in on Bitcoin, but forward-thinking investors are zeroing in on a radically different project with explosive upside: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Currently in Stage 3 of its presale at just $0.0012, LILPEPE isn’t just another frog-faced memecoin. It’s a fully engineered Layer 2 blockchain, explicitly built for memecoins, focusing on speed, scalability, and anti-bot security. As memecoins continue to dominate retail attention, LILPEPE is creating the rails they’ll run on and positioning itself as the Solana of meme tokens. Why it stands out: Zero tax and near-zero fees Sniper bot protection — a first in meme token design Dedicated memecoin launchpad Tokenomics built for long-term scale: 26.5% Presale 30% Chain Reserves 13.5% Staking 10% Liquidity 10% Marketing 10% DEX Listings Unlike most low-cap memecoins, LILPEPE is confirmed for two Tier-1 CEX listings at launch, with rumors circulating about a possible deal with the world’s largest crypto exchange. Add a $777,000 presale giveaway (10 winners will receive $77,000 in LILPEPE each), and we have one of the most anticipated altcoins of the year. Solana: Regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand Solana’s inclusion in ETF filings isn’t just a nod to its strong performance — it’s recognition of its maturing role in the crypto ecosystem. The SEC’s engagement with filings for a Solana ETF, with a final deadline set for October 10, 2025, suggests that the agency views SOL as a potential commodity, especially given that CFTC-regulated Solana futures are already trading. Analysts estimate a 95% chance of ETF approval, fueling renewed demand from institutional investors. Solana has already recovered from the FTX fallout and established itself as the backbone for multiple high-velocity applications, from DeFi and NFTs to on-chain games and social platforms like Dialect and DRiP. If the ETF gets the green light, SOL could see Bitcoin-level inflows from traditional finance players looking to diversify exposure without venturing too far from the blue-chip space. XRP: A regulatory favorite with ETF momentum XRP’s journey through the legal gauntlet has made it one of the best-positioned digital assets for regulatory clarity. The SEC said on January 30, 2025, that it had received a request for a spot XRP ETF. Big names, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, are supporting it. Analysts expect almost specific approval because the final decision is due on October 17, 2025. Why the optimism? Regulators already view XRP as a commodity. It has CFTC-regulated futures contracts in place. A strong global remittance use case supports its real-world value. As Texas pioneers a Bitcoin reserve, states and municipalities will eventually seek diversified crypto treasuries. XRP, with its institutional-grade infrastructure and fast settlement system, is likely to be included. The bigger picture: Why states like Texas are setting the tone Texas isn’t alone. States like Arizona and New Hampshire have passed similar legislation, and many more are watching closely. What’s different about Texas is that it’s funding the reserve, showing commitment far beyond the performative level. And as Bitcoin ETFs normalize crypto exposure, it’s only a matter of time before states begin exploring other asset-backed reserves. This is where tokens like Solana, XRP, and LILPEPE come in. SOL brings scalability and developer activity. XRP offers remittance utility and legal clarity. LILPEPE taps into cultural energy while building its infrastructure, making it the highest-risk, highest-reward play of the three. Final thoughts: A portfolio strategy for the state-backed crypto era As regulations become clearer and more states adopt cryptocurrencies, the rules for both retail and institutional investors are changing. It’s no longer enough just to hold Bitcoin or Ethereum; investors need to find the next level of fundamental assets. Solana is a scalable smart contract platform. XRP is the compliance-first remittance tool. Little Pepe is the chain built for meme virality, web3 culture, and viral user onboarding. As Texas and others begin to normalize crypto treasuries, demand for high-conviction altcoins is expected to surge. For those willing to take action before the next leg up, now could be the time to stack before the rest of the country catches on.

It is no longer news that the United States has established its Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) valued at over $20 billion. Texas has signed the Bitcoin Reserve bill into law, with $10 million already allocated to the cause. Similarly, some governments are also mulling the idea of establishing their Bitcoin treasury amidst increasing demand. Recently, Pradeep Bhandari, a spokesperson for India’s ruling party, voiced his opinion about India exploring the idea of having its own BTC Reserve. Should the Asian country make such a move, Bhandari thinks it will be keeping pace with global changes. Bitcoin Gives Holders Financial Control The growing popularity and adoption of Bitcoin come from the perceived prospects of the coin and its future performance. Several entities are drawn to the financial control that the top crypto asset offers. During the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held in Washington, D.C., HRF’s Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, discussed the role of BTC in protecting citizens against oppressive regimes. Gladstein explained that the fact that governments are not able to track BTC makes it difficult for them to freeze or seize funds. Oftentimes, the industry has seen authoritarian regimes leverage this common tactic to control their populations.

2025-06-29T16:00:25,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2 Billion Inflows As Institutional Demand Surges – Details","The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin’s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Bitcoin ETFs On Impressive 14-Day Positive Streak Despite Market Uncertainty On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs’ positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market’s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares’ ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million – $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin’s price appreciation prospects. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel – Next Move Could Be Parabolic Ethereum ETFs Log $283 Million In Deposit To Close Out H1 2025 In other developments, SoSoValue data also reveals that US Ethereum Spot ETFs notched up a cumulative inflow of $283.41 million over the last week extending their positive streak to seven consecutive weeks. In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,441 with Bitcoin prices set around $107,339.

2025-06-29T15:45:18,"Wells Fargo Refuses To Reimburse Disabled Customer After $6,805 Drained From Bank Account: Report","The banking giant Wells Fargo is reportedly refusing to reimburse a disabled customer who lost thousands of dollars to scammers who impersonated bank employees. 52-year-old Paul Schendel, a diabetic man who was disabled due to a back injury, lost $6,805 to scammers posing as Wells Fargo employees, reports the local news station FOX 26. Schendel received a phone call one day from a number that showed up as Wells Fargo on the caller ID. The caller, who had specific knowledge of his banking details, told him that fraudulent activity had been detected on his Wells Fargo account. Later that day, a woman came to his door, cut up his bank card and took the pieces with her, including the chip. The woman even told Schendel that he should go to the bank the next day to get a new card. But when Schendel went to Wells Fargo, he was informed that the bank would never conduct such activities or ever call customers, and that the funds in his account would likely never be recovered. Schendel eventually got a letter from Wells Fargo confirming that the bank would not reimburse his losses. Says Wells Fargo, “We have completed our research of your inquiry about the charges of $6,805 on your account… Based on the information available to us, and because the transactions were made using your card and Personal Identification Number (PIN), we found it was made by you or someone who had your permission. Please consider your claim closed.” FOX26 says it reached out to Wells Fargo to learn about Schendel’s case, but has not yet received any word from the banking giant.

2025-06-29T15:31:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Can ETF Demand Power BTC To A New All-Time High?","Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stationary over the past 24 hours, holding above $107,000 to trade around $107,350. However, ETF demand and Fed policy cues could significantly dictate price action in the near term. BTC started the week with price swings and high volatility, as it fell below $100,000 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 on Monday. Mid-Tier Investors Drive Activity An analysis by CryptoQuant contributor “Oinonen” has revealed a sharp jump in whale-level and mid-tier investors driving wallet activity on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The analyst revealed that inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallets are generally controlled by high-net-worth individuals or mid-sized institutions. Whale-level inflows make up 20% of the total inflows, suggesting that mid-tier investors are driving exchange activity. However, whale activity has also peaked in recent sessions. Bitcoin inflows of 10,000 BTC surged on June 16, making up 83% of total exchange inflows on the day, reinforcing earlier observations about increased whale activity over the past year. Binance’s overall deposit metrics also indicate a growing trend of larger average deposits rising from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC . Most Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Not Survive Death Spiral According to a report by VC firm Breed, only a few Bitcoin treasury companies can avoid the “death spiral” that could impact BTC holding companies trading close to the net asset value (NAV). According to the report, the health of Bitcoin treasury companies depends on their ability to command a multiple of their net asset value (MNAV). The report outlined a seven-phase decline of Bitcoin treasury companies, starting with a drop in the Bitcoin price, driving the company’s share price close to its actual NAV. This makes it harder for the companies to secure debt and equity financing critical to the asymmetric trade of converting the US dollar into a supply-capped appreciating asset. As credit access dries up and debt maturity looms, margin calls could be triggered, forcing the companies to sell BTC in the market and lowering the asset price. This could cause a consolidation of holding companies to be acquired by stronger firms, potentially triggering a market-wide downturn. The report stated, “Ultimately, only a select few companies will sustain a lasting MNAV premium. They will earn it through strong leadership, disciplined execution, savvy marketing, and distinctive strategies that continue to grow Bitcoin-per-share regardless of broader market fluctuations.” A death spiral could trigger the next crypto bear market. However, the report stated that most Bitcoin treasury companies finance their purchases with equity instead of debt, mitigating potential impacts to a certain extent. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $107,000 over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading at $107,681. Market watchers expect price action to pick up in the next week, potentially rising to new all-time highs. Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicted that Bitcoin is displaying an extremely bullish setup that could push it to a new all-time high as early as next week. Van de Poppe highlighted $110.5 as the crucial breakout level. BTC could surge to a new all-time high if it clears this level. While momentum is slow, analysts believe the bull run is not yet over. The MVRC ratio is at 2:2, significantly lower than peak levels, indicating there is room to grow. BTC’s next big move depends on whether it can break above the resistance at around $110,000. However, analysts like AlphaBTC believe it will take substantial momentum to flip this resistance level. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued registering strong inflows. The week ending June 27 saw inflows skyrocket, with BlackRock’s IBIT registering weekly net inflows of $1,310 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registered net inflows of $504.5 million. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) registered net inflows of $268 million. US spot bitcoin ETFs extended their ETF streak to 14 sessions, recording over $2.9 billion in weekly inflows. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping 1.19% on Friday, slipping below the 50-day SMA, and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $102,180. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified. However, it rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. BTC surged over 4% on Monday following the Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement. As a result, it reclaimed $105,000 and settled at $105,442. The price continued pushing higher on Tuesday, rising 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,138. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Wednesday, with BTC rising 1.18% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,393. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $106,970. A marginal recovery on Friday saw BTC reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,129. Price action remained positive on Saturday, rising to $107,339. The current session sees BTC up 0.51%, trading around $107,885. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-29T14:50:40,"IBIT:CA: Bitcoin Exposure For Non-Crypto Investors","Summary IBIT:CA offers convenient, cost-effective Bitcoin exposure for traditional investors through BlackRock’s trusted ETF structure, bypassing crypto exchange complexities. Bitcoin’s strong historical performance and growing mainstream adoption make it a compelling asset for diversification, hedging, or price participation. IBIT:CA stands out with a low 0.32% management fee, matching Fidelity and undercutting other Canadian Bitcoin ETFs on cost. The ETF structure reduces custodial risk, but investors must accept Bitcoin’s high volatility and regulatory risks; prudent allocation is advised. Author's Note: All figures listed in Canadian currency unless otherwise noted. Investment Thesis The iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT:CA ) offers a convenient and cost-effective means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) through BlackRock’s family of iShares ETFs. In eight of the past eleven calendar years to 2024, bitcoin was the best performing asset by asset class. Whether for diversification, hedging or price exposure, bitcoin has seen its ownership base expand from crypto-enthusiasts to institutional and traditional investors. Traditional investors seeking exposure to bitcoin for participation in cryptocurrency may have found bitcoin to be inaccessible, inconvenient or intimidating due to the complex nature of coin exchanges or crypto exchange platforms. IBIT:CA offers the familiarity of an ETF format presented by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers. This product is an ideal vehicle for investors who want exposure to Bitcoin without having to interface with the complexities of owning it directly through a crypto exchange. Fund Profile Launched in Canada in January 2025, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has net assets of approximately $215MM on 5.1 million units outstanding. This Canadian debut follows the January 2024 listing of iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) on the NASDAQ. This U.S.-listed fund has grown to $70B in assets and has consistently been the highest volume bitcoin ETF. Through a custodial partnership with Coinbase, IBIT seeks to reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. IBIT:CA trades on the Cboe Global Stock Exchange, operating in Canada since 2015. This stock exchange is responsible for approximately 15% of listed security trading volume in Canada and specializes in ETFs, with over 1,200 funds trading on their ETF Market Canada. Beyond a small cash contingency of 0.08% to facilitate liquidity, Canadian-listed IBIT:CA invests substantially all of its holdings in the underlying U.S.-listed IBIT. This ETF can be owned in Canadian funds ((IBIT:CA)) or in U.S. currency ( IBIT.U:CA ) iShares Bitcoin ETF - USD Units. IBIT:CA has a management fee of 0.32%, equating to $32 in fees for every $10,000 invested. With no dividends and a strategy of long-term holding, the fund does not have any distributions. Background Bitcoin is not a productive asset in and of itself, therefore it’s helpful to think about cryptocurrency as an asset class to gain exposure to, rather than a vehicle to generate wealth. It is with this risk management lens that I consider the role of bitcoin in my portfolio. In previous coverage of MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) “MicroStrategy Incorporated: Get Bitcoin Exposure Without Leaving The Nasdaq”, I wrote: If you are a traditional investor like me who holds a portfolio of publicly traded equities in a brokerage account, you may have been sitting on the sidelines as bitcoin makes fresh headlines for breaking new valuation records. As a long-term buy-and-hold investor, I don’t spend a lot of time chasing fads or making investment decisions based on the “fear of missing out.” I do however spend time thinking about asset allocation in my portfolio and protection against inflation. The iShares Bitcoin ETF allows less adventurous investors to add bitcoin to their portfolios without leaving their brokerage accounts. My preference is to have my securities all in one place to optimize portfolio management. With this in mind, I have been reluctant to deal with the hassle of opening an account on a cryptocurrency trading platform. I prefer the simplicity of a one-stop-shop discount brokerage platform and am uninterested in transferring funds, reviewing a new trading commission structure and registering with another platform. The familiarity with the ETF structure and the iShares suite of products that can be purchased through one’s existing brokerage makes IBIT:CA convenient and accessible. My own brokerage account has an integrated cryptocurrency trading platform, so I can manage my modest bitcoin exposure within the context of my larger portfolio. This platform reflects my ""core and explore"" style of investing, whereby I hold a core portfolio of diversified equities with some modest exposure to bitcoin and other alternatives. In recent years, investor confidence in crypto exchanges was shaken through the high-profile fraud case of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX. A 2024 report from the Pew Research Center found that 63% said they had little to no confidence that ""current ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe"". For many investors, including myself, the opportunity to bypass cryptocurrency exchanges by owning bitcoin through exchange-listed wrappers on local exchanges offers additional peace of mind and removes a barrier to participation. Does Bitcoin Belong in Your Portfolio? I am not a bitcoin evangelist and I am not prepared to articulate a bull case for the cryptocurrency. It is worth noting, however, that as an asset class, bitcoin has delivered impressive long-term performance, far outpacing equity market indices. Performance of Bitcoin vs the S&P500 (SA) While I do not advocate chasing past performance, I do think that there is room for multiple asset classes to be represented within a diversified portfolio. To this end, it may be worth evaluating whether some exposure to bitcoin makes sense in your own portfolio. Bitcoin has become increasingly mainstream and institutional. With a $2.1T market cap , pension funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors have been drawn to bitcoin for the increased liquidity, transparency and exposure to new asset classes. A 2025 digital assets survey from EY-Parthenon research indicated that 85% of respondents increased allocations to digital assets and digital assets-related products in 2024. This survey also reports that firms have been increasing their weightings in digital assets, with 59% of respondents planning to allocate over 5% of their assets under management to cryptocurrencies. 2025Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey (EY Digital Asset Survey 2025) The growing suite of products for retail investors also speaks to bitcoin's shift toward mainstream investing. This growth has taken off following the January, 2024 decision from the SEC to greenlight the creation of U.S.-listed ETFs tracking the spot price of bitcoin. Retail investors have wasted no time in moving into these new funds. According to RBC Direct Investing : Inflows to U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted over $6 billion of inflows in May, equating to 7% of all ETF inflows this month. It is a notable haul and propels IBIT to the 5th highest amount of YTD ETF inflows; joining an impressive list led by beta-stalwarts VOO, SGOV, VTI and SPLG. Peer ETF Comparison With a singular underlying asset and no meaningful portfolio composition to differentiate bitcoin ETFs, these funds compete on fees. Bitcoin ETFs have been available in Canada since February 2021, when the Purpose Bitcoin ETF ( BTCC:CA ) debuted. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF has $3B in assets offering ample liquidity, however it has a relatively high 1.31% MER with a 1% management fee. The first mover advantage Purpose had in this space allowed it to charge a higher fee. The CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF C$ Unhedged Series Units ( BTCX.B:CA ), has approximately $1.3B in assets. This ETF charges an MER of 0.69% with a management fee of 0.40%. The Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC:CA ) is the third-largest provider in Canada with $1.2B in assets. Responding to new market entrants like iShares, Fidelity recently lowered its management fee from 0.40% to 0.32%. ETF Assets Management Fee iShares Bitcoin ETF ((IBIT:CA)) $215MM 0.32% Purpose Bitcoin ETF ((BTCC:CA)) $3.0B 1.00% CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF C$ Unhedged Series Units ((BTCX.B:CA)) $1.3B 0.40% Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF ((FBTC:CA)) $1.2B 0.32% Compared to its more established peers, the iShares Bitcoin ETF ties with Fidelity in offering relative value with its management fee of 0.32%. IBIT:CA hasn’t been trading long enough to report its MER. Risk Analysis This ETF structure seeks to mitigate the custodial risks associated with owning bitcoin directly through a crypto exchange platform. The inherent risks of the underlying cryptocurrency asset are still reflected in IBIT:CA, however. Bitcoin is highly volatile. While bitcoin has clocked double-digit returns in eight of the past eleven calendar years, when BTC corrects, it has done so in dramatic fashion. In 2018, bitcoin lost 78% of its value and again in 2022, it gave up gains to close 64% down. Bitcoin performance vs other asset classes (Blackrock iShares) Beyond volatility, IBIT:CA is highly concentrated with the ETF comprised of a singular asset. Prudent investors may consider a modest position in IBIT:CA as a complement to a diversified portfolio of stocks. Importantly, iShares rates the ETF’s risk as “high”, the highest rating on its five point risk scale. Investors should also consider regulatory risks before owning cryptocurrencies. The pro-crypto stance taken by the Trump administration in the U.S. has increasingly led to a regulatory environment seen by the industry as more constructive for product innovation. In other jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are viewed less favourably. Crypto Regulation by Country (Coinclub) Conclusion The iShares Bitcoin ETF offers an accessible and convenient option for Canadian investors seeking exposure to bitcoin. The ETF structure allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to engage with a cryptocurrency exchange and to own it through a familiar institutional name, BlackRock. With one of the lowest management fees in the sector, IBIT:CA offers better value than larger incumbent bitcoin ETFs. With little to differentiate these products, the lower fee is an important consideration. For traditional investors curious about cryptocurrency, this is an easy way to test the waters.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798113-ibitca-bitcoin-exposure-for-non-crypto-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT:CA|BTC-USD|IBIT",cryptocompare

Since the Ceasefire in the Middle East, a few meme coins have recovered nicely from their recent lows and posted gains over the past 48 hours. Pengu leads the rally so far with an over 30% increase, but it currently appears to have slowed down the rally after failing to close above the $0.015 level yesterday. The current daily drop looks more like a retest of a broken level. There’s still hope for more increases in the short term as the buyers are likely to mount pressure as soon as they find support on the lower timeframe. If that fails to happen, the Solana-based token may pull lower before picking up again. But from the look of things, the bulls are much more likely to have an upper hand in the coming days, provided that Bitcoin’s price remains strong weekly. Otherwise, the entire crypto market may continue to fall. Currently, market sentiments and biases look positive with a potential bullish sign. Once Pengu manages to surpass the previous monthly high, a bigger rally can be expected in the short term. Pengu Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Pengu currently appears indecisive on the daily chart. A push above yesterday’s high could allow recovery to the previous monthly $0.0175 resistance. The $0.0274 and $0.047 resistance levels would be the next area of interest to watch for a breakout. Failure to advance bullish may result in a deep pullback to the key $0.01 level. Below it lies the $0.0076 support. A breakdown there could roll us back to the $0.00525 level. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0175, $0.0274, $0.047 Key Support Levels: $0.01, $0.0076, $0.00525 Price: $0.0134 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The chart indicates a significant bullish reversal, with an inverted hammer candlestick pattern spotted in the analysis. The analysis is grounded in classical technical charting principles and predicts a potential uptrend as the pair moves toward a breakout in August. #XRP / #BTC – You Are Not #Bullish Enough: Inverted Hammer Candles #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and We Shall Fly So High . pic.twitter.com/imoZwmKA0E — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 28, 2025 XRP Inverted Hammer and Support Structure The chart features a large symmetrical triangle structure containing XRP/BTC’s recent price action. At the time of his analysis, the pair traded around 0.00002042 BTC ($2.194), sitting on the edge of structural support. What makes the current setup notable is the formation of an inverted hammer candlestick , which is commonly interpreted as a bullish reversal signal, particularly after a downtrend. The analyst emphasizes that XRP is not being viewed bullishly enough by the broader market, despite technical evidence to the contrary. He encourages the XRP community to “stay steady and strong,” reinforcing the sentiment that a major price move could be on the horizon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Fibonacci Levels and Short-Term Targets Critical resistance levels are also clearly laid out. This includes the Fibonacci retracement zones. Notably, the 0.702 level (approximately 0.00002468 BTC/$2.652) and the 0.786 level (around 0.00002893 BTC/$3.1) are marked as key upside targets in the short to mid-term. These lie above the current range but within striking distance should bullish momentum emerge. A green zone extending to 0.00002700 BTC ($2.9) provides a cue for a potential breakout zone above triangle resistance. Conversely, a red horizontal support line at approximately 0.00001930 BTC ($2.07) signals the last line of structural defense. This coincides with the lower boundary of the triangle and appears to be acting as a base for the inverted hammer to take effect. XRP Long-term Targets Longer-term projections are drawn using Fibonacci extensions, with the 1.272, 1.414, and 1.618 levels suggesting potential future targets of 0.00007262 BTC ($7.8), 0.00009502 BTC ($10.2), and 0.00013982 BTC ($15), respectively. These targets sit well above historical resistance, and all represent new all-time highs for XRP if the current pattern plays out. EGRAG CRYPTO has previously predicted double-digit targets for XRP , and the chart marks August 25 as a key date for the upcoming breakout. While market confirmation is still pending, the groundwork for an upward move is technically laid out, with specific levels to monitor in the weeks ahead.

2025-06-29T14:33:15,"BITO: On The Verge Of A Break To New Highs","Summary BITO provides convenient Bitcoin exposure via futures, offering strong correlation and significant income distributions, though not a perfect 1:1 price tracker. Distributions are highly volatile but meaningful, totaling nearly half the share price over the past year, making total return analysis essential. While direct Bitcoin ownership outperformed BITO on total return, BITO's accessibility and income potential make it an attractive alternative for many investors. Technical patterns and momentum indicators suggest further upside, so I maintain my strong buy rating on BITO for continued Bitcoin exposure. As alt-coin OG Bitcoin is knocking on the door to all-time highs once again, it’s a good chance to review which funds are best to gain exposure, if you so choose. Cryptos are firmly in the mainstream of investing now, as the rise of exchange-traded funds in their dozens, making it easier than ever to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. One very popular choice for Bitcoin exposure is the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) , a $2.5 billion fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin, but with a twist. The last time I covered BITO was last October, and I called it a strong buy on the idea that its downtrend was ending. It’s up 61% on a total return basis since then, so we’ll call that one a win. But what about now? I’m still quite bullish, and I’m doubling down on my strong buy rating. What is BITO? BITO seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin over time, minus fees and expenses. That’s a familiar goal as there are numerous funds that look to do the very same thing. But rather than owning Bitcoin directly, BITO owns a huge position in Bitcoin futures. Here’s what the fund owns as of the close on Friday. Fund website The fund owns $2.5 billion in July Bitcoin futures, and it rolls its positions regularly so it’s always got what is essentially spot exposure to Bitcoin futures. That, in turn, tracks spot Bitcoin prices without owning Bitcoin directly. This is a slightly different philosophy to funds that directly own Bitcoin, but as we’ll see below, owning futures works as well. StockCharts This is the 20-day rolling correlation between BITO and Bitcoin itself, and its current value is 0.89. That’s actually a bit lower than it has been in recent months, when it spent a lot of time very near 1.00. At any rate, 0.89 is still almost perfect, so if you’re looking for Bitcoin exposure, you can do much worse. The other thing is that BITO is not just a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin pricing; it offers massive distributions as well. Some funds do not offer distributions, and therefore, their price charts will more closely reflect the movements of Bitcoin itself. BITO offers that exposure to Bitcoin, but also a huge amount of distributions. ProShares has an explanation of how BITO (and its other similar funds) generate distribution, if you’re curious. And those distributions are extremely consequential to total returns for BITO. Seeking Alpha We can see that distributions are extremely volatile, so this is nothing like owning a Dividend King where you know what you’re getting with reasonable accuracy. BITO distributes based upon the formula in the link above, and the payout changes every single month. Over time, the distributions are meaningful to say the least, but the monthly payout range for the past year has been 36 cents to $1.77. Total distributions in the past 12 months is almost $12 per share , or more than half the current share price. That means that if we’re going to track BITO’s progress against simply owning Bitcoin itself – which is a logical alternative – we need to look at total returns, not simply price returns. Seeking Alpha For the past year, Bitcoin itself has outperformed BITO on a total return basis by about 15%. That’s a lot, and if you want to get the best exposure to Bitcoin, you’ll need a way to do that directly. However, if you like the ease and accessibility of owning it through an exchange-traded fund, BITO offers a nice alternative. The other thing is that BITO offers strong income possibilities, whereas Bitcoin obviously doesn’t, and never will. That income can be reinvested for more shares of BITO, or it can fund your lifestyle. It’s just a different way to gain exposure, and it’s not for everyone. Where is BITO headed? I have remained bullish on Bitcoin and linked funds for some time, and nothing about that has changed. The pattern in BITO looks very much to me like a bull flag, and if that’s right, BITO (and Bitcoin) are headed much higher. StockCharts BITO ran from the April low of $15 to a new high of $22.56, all the while paying its distributions. There was a 50-day SMA test in the past week, from which BITO bounced immediately and significantly. The flag pattern is filling out very nicely, the upper and lower bounds of which you can see above. In addition, the PPO has made a centerline test and the histogram is looking like it’s about to go positive. If that occurs, it makes the breakout direction from the flag much more likely to be up. Flags are consolidation patterns, so they are likely to resolve in the direction of prior trend. That was obviously an uptrend, and it amounted to about $7 per share from the April low. Should the flag resolve to the upside – which I fully expect – we should be looking at a similar move in BITO. That would be something like $29 as a target. We’ll see, but the risk/reward here is excellent as you can use the 50-day SMA, or the bottom of the flag pattern as a stop. Wrapping up If you are looking for direct exposure one-for-one with Bitcoin, BITO probably isn’t the best choice for that. The price doesn’t strictly track Bitcoin because BITO pays such massive distributions, and has a bit of tracking error from the futures it owns. On a total return basis, as well as the correlation of prices between the two, it is quite good. BITO offers income in a big way, but also the ease and convenience of owning Bitcoin exposure through an exchange-traded product rather than needing a wallet to hold Bitcoin. I continue to like Bitcoin, and I continue to like BITO as an alternative way to gain exposure to Bitcoin upside. I’m retaining my strong buy on BITO here.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798111-bito-on-the-verge-of-a-break-to-new-highs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","BITO",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T14:30:18,"Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe?","After an eventful start to the week marked by a sharp downward swing below $100,000, the Bitcoin price has recovered excellently, returning above the $107,000 mark to close the week. In spite of Bitcoin’s recent recovery, there seems to be a different sentiment in the market which, interestingly, has been growing over time. Here’s how the current growing sentiment could affect the premier cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Short Positions Surge Over The Past 7 Days — What This Means In a June 28th post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal shared an interesting on-chain development in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: You Won’t Believe Who’s Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Liquidity Zone (7 Days) indicator, which measures three important data: on one hand, it is used to monitor the price movement of Bitcoin; on another, the Net Delta of open interest or positions; and, lastly, it shows the distribution of open interest at various price levels. For a little context, the open interest Net Delta measures the difference between long and short open positions in the market. If the Net Delta reads positive, it means the buyers populate the market more. On the other hand, a negative reading means there are more short positions open than longs. In the post on X, Alphractal pointed out that, over the span of seven days, more positions have been opened in a bet against the price of BTC. From the chart below, the red bars represent a negative Net Delta. As has been formerly explained, what this means is that the short traders currently dominate the market. Interestingly, the shorts-dominated market does not exactly guarantee that we will experience a sell-off in the near future. This is because the high negative Net Delta was recorded at a time when Bitcoin’s price is still at a stable level, even with little growth. When sell positions are opened in a stable but bullish market, this usually indicates that the bears might be getting trapped. If, eventually, the Bitcoin price overcomes the sell resistance, a phenomenon known as a short squeeze will occur. In this scenario, sellers will be forced to buy back at higher prices, thereby pushing the Bitcoin price to the upside. This upward momentum will then further liquidate short positions. What’s Next For Bitcoin? There are uncertainties as to whether the Bitcoin market might break the sell resistance, or go in favour of the sellers. For this reason, Alphractal warns that those with bearish sentiment should be cautious about their next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,500 In Squeeze-Driven Rally – But Can It Hold? As of this writing, Bitcoin seems stuck within a choppy range over the past day and is currently valued at $107,309.

The firm’s trading desk says that it’s “time to get bulled up again” following the de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, reports CNBC. America’s largest bank says fading geopolitical risks are enabling investors to shift their attention back to market fundamentals. “With Israel/Iran seemingly defused, the market is resuming its march to/through all-time highs… With this geopolitical risk behind us, the market is refocusing on the macro picture, preparing for earnings, and watching the looming deadline on the expiration of the tariff moratorium. We shift our view back to Tactically Bullish with the bullish hypothesis based on resilient macro data, positive EPS (earnings per share) growth and thawing trade war rhetoric.” Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is keeping a close watch on one group of stocks that it thinks will make an epic comeback in the coming months. In a new Bloomberg Television interview, Morgan Stanley Investment Management senior portfolio manager Andrew Slimmon says that the Magnificent 7 stocks, which dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500, will likely soar next year as they start to see their investments in artificial intelligence pay off. “I hear all the time: US exceptionalism is over. That’s the argument for outside the US. I get that. But I think what’s really going on here is that the very large, the Magnificent Seven, they’re spending a lot of money on capex (capital expenditures) rollout, and they’re telling us, ‘Don’t worry, this will all pay off down the road.’ Well, I wouldn’t bet against these guys, but right now their return on invested capital has come down a little bit. So I could see a scenario where you get to the end of the year, the rest of the world has done better than the S&P and the 493 has done better than the cap-weighted, and everyone said, ‘Oh, it’s all over, US exceptionalism is all over.’ And guess what? All these companies that start to employ AI are going to use these services, and you’re going to see the S&P cap-weighted come roaring back next year.” The Mag 7 is made up of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta.

2025-06-29T14:19:41,"Columbus Circle Capital I: Ugly Merger, Interesting Trade","Summary CCCM's merger with ProCap BTC values Bitcoin holdings at a steep premium, disadvantaging SPAC investors compared to direct BTC or ETF exposure. Deal structure favors preferred equity and the sponsor, leaving SPAC shareholders with less than their fair share and significant downside if BTC falls. Post-merger strategy lacks clarity on building a real operating business, and the capital structure limits flexibility to capitalize on BTC price moves. Despite long-term skepticism, CCCM offers a low-risk, short-term trade opportunity with limited downside and potential upside before the redemption deadline. This week, SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I ( CCCM ) announced plans to merge with ProCap BTC LLC. As a SPAC, CCC is just a pile of cash; ProCap is essentially just a pile of Bitcoin. At the current CCCM stock price of $10.73, and the current BTC price of just over $107,000, the merger values each dollar in ProCap's Bitcoin stash at about $1.43. Whether that's a good deal is a matter of perspective. One view is that paying $1.43 in cash for $1 in Bitcoin is ludicrous on its face. Investors can buy Bitcoin for pretty close to $1, whether via direct ownership or an exchange-traded fund. ProCap's structure does suggest some leverage to the BTC price, but that leverage is not guaranteed, and investors have myriad ways to gain levered exposure to Bitcoin, all of which appear to be lower-cost. The contrary view, however, is that 1.43:1 is actually a pretty good ratio for what have become known as Bitcoin treasury companies. The pioneer and the largest of the group obviously is Strategy ( MSTR ), which has an enterprise value 1.87x the value of its Bitcoin holdings. There's some value in Strategy's legacy software business, but at this point not much; even accounting for those operations, the premium here is in the range of 80%. Other companies (130, per the CCC/ProCap merger presentation) have executed similar strategies in Bitcoin and other coins and gotten bigger premiums; Metaplanet ( OTC:MTPLF ) is valued at nearly 5x its Bitcoin stash . The problem for ProCap, however, is that the initial response to the deal itself suggests the post-merger entity is not likely to follow the MSTR path, let alone that of Metaplanet. Meanwhile, ProCap chief executive officer Anthony Pompliano, a longtime investor (and Twitter/X personality and podcast host), has made some comments about creating an operating business here as well, but it's not clear exactly that is supposed to be. To top it off, the structure of the capital raise beyond the SPAC cash suggests a real possibility of a wave of pre-merger redemptions. All told, it's hard to have too much optimism about the post-merger entity here. But with CCCM stock not that far above the redemption price, there is an interesting pre-merger trade to be had, with a low-risk option on a spike in BTC and/or a return to a more optimistic outlook toward crypto treasury companies more broadly. The Deal Structure For CCCM Stock The post-merger ProCap will have $1 billion in capital, raised from three sources : CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 The SPAC has $256 million in cash in trust, thanks to a $250 million initial public offering last month. The $517 million in equity already has been raised, with most of the funds used to buy BTC over the last two days. The convertibles will be issued at the merger close. On its face, this doesn't seem like a bad deal: ProCap is raising $1 billion and buying just shy of 9,500 BTC (note that the presentation was based on a BTC price of $100,000). But a closer look shows that SPAC investors are being disadvantaged here. It also explains why the initial optimism toward the deal, spiked by leaked details to the Financial Times , has faded so dramatically: Data by YCharts Notably, the preferred equity is getting into the SPAC at $8 per share (each preferred stock unit converts to common stock at a 1.25x ratio ). The notes convert at $13 per share, but they're also 2x collateralized by Bitcoin (or cash, but as seen above the post-merger ProCap will have minimal cash). Paying $10.70 For $7.50 (Or Less) Because of both the discount offered the preferred equity holder and a pretty substantial promote for Pompliano, CCCM investors wind up getting what looks like less than their fair share: CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 In the indicative example, with the BTC price at $100,000, post-merger ProCap would be have a net asset value of $955 million ($950 million in BTC plus $5 million in cash). SPAC shareholders would get 19.7%, or $188 million; even at $10, the premium is about 1.33x. In reality, the numbers are a bit different. ProCap already has purchased 4,932 BTC this week for a total of $514 million. That leaves $436 million in cash (from the SPAC and the converts), for an NAV of $950 million, or a per-share NAV of $7.50. The current price of $10.70 is thus about a 1.43x premium. But even that is a bit inflated, because it assumes the convertibles actually convert into stock. Treat the converts as debt (as would be the case with CCCM and/or the post-merger stock below $13) and NAV is actually $715 million across 108.6 million shares. That's a per-share figure of just $6.58, suggesting a current premium of about 63%. (It's also an example of just how important the convertibles actually converting is to the success of the treasury plan.) Two Post-Merger Problems For Columbus Circle Capital I The structure here creates two problems assuming the merger goes through. The first is looking to the downside and upside. Even if the cash from the SPAC and the converts buys BTC at $100K (adding 4,910 BTC, essentially doubling the current stash), a move in the Bitcoin price to $80K would leave net asset value somewhere around $550 million (again, treating the converts as debt, so 108.6 million shares outstanding and $230M in net debt). Net asset value here is a little over $5; in this scenario, it's not hard to imagine CCCM dropping below $7. In other words, the downside here is amplified even with some kind of treasury premium: a ~25% decline in Bitcoin leads to a 35%-plus drop in CCCM stock. But the converse is not necessarily true. The SPAC agreement includes ""adjustment shares"", which will be issued to the sponsor and the preferred equity investors if BTC rises between now and the close. Basically, their number of shares increases by the same percentage BTC does . Imagine, for instance, BTC doubling; the share of equity owned by SPAC shareholders in the post-merger ProCap drops by half . NAV ($7.50 per share assuming conversion) only goes to about $10; at the same premium, CCCM stock would be worth less than $15. For this to work, then, the premium has to expand . In theory, post-merger this can happen (and indeed it has happened for MSTR, which has consistently outpaced Bitcoin). But part of the reason Strategy has outperformed is that it keeps adding to its Bitcoin haul on the way up. It would seem that ProCap has designs on a similar strategy (no pun intended). The issue is that the post-merger structure means that the company will have no cash to adjust its holdings. Pompliano and ProCap claim to have a workaround, however, as witnessed by the last two bullet points on this slide: CCCM/ProCap merger presentation, June 2025 The problem is that the strategy here, such as it is, is basically to buy (Bitcoin) low and sell (CCCM stock) high. In bullet point #2, ""Strategically rais[ing] capital during favorable market cycles to scale our Bitcoin holdings"" means that ProCap will issue equity and/or converts when the demand is there. ""Tactical accumulation, including strategic dips, volatility harvesting, and programmatic purchases aligned with macro signals and capital cycles"" is a long way of saying that ProCap wants to buy the coin low. Buying low and selling high perhaps can work for an expert trader. For a publicly traded company, however, it's a much more difficult endeavor. Is ProCap going to have an at-the-market offering that just dumps shares every time the premium to BTC expands? That seems like an instantly recognizable and consistent overhang. Is it in turn going to buy every dip in BTC? That's certainly been a smart strategy for the past 15-plus years, but, again, ProCap has to actually raise the cash to make those buys. More broadly, there's no real evidence that Pompliano (or his associates) have the acumen to move into Bitcoin and out of the stock in a way that is accretive to shareholder value rather than investment bank and exchange fees. To be fair, Pompliano has said that ProCap will build a business on top of the Bitcoin stash. As he told CNBC in an interview : I believe that the future of these companies is going to be how do you build revenue and profit with financial services on top of that. No different than if you look at the traditional financial service firms. They have a balance sheet of dollars, and they go and they build these financial services on top that drive revenue and profit. I think that you still have to build a business on top of a big pile of Bitcoin. But there's been zero discussion of what these ""financial services"" are supposed to be. Pompliano told CNBC that he and ProCap ""sit at the intersection between the Internet and the Bitcoiners and the institutional world."" That's been a good business for Pompliano personally — he himself is investing $8.5 million in the deal — but there is no real evidence that positioning will create a good business for ProCap shareholders. Owning CCCM And Not ProCap And yet, with the pullback below $11, there is an intriguing potential trade here. The merger presentation cited $256 million in trust value for the CCCM SPAC, meaning redemption value should be $10.24 per share. That suggests 4%-5% downside from the current level (the cash in trust will increase over time as interest is accrued, but investors still will be down 4%-5% relative to simply holding a money market fund or short-term Treasuries). That's not a terrible downside given that there is some potential upside between now and when the redemption deadline for the merger arrives. A sharp rally in BTC would probably bleed over here. Meanwhile, the merger presentation points out Pompliano's impressive online reach. At least from a Twitter/X search, Bitcoin fans seem mostly disappointed with the deal , (trading in CCCM obviously suggests the same) but Pompliano has the time and the megaphone to change sentiment. Indeed, we've already seen a similar trade work in another SPAC, Colombier Acquisition Corp. II ( CLBR ). CLBR too saw an early retail-driven rally (this one being more political; Donald Trump Jr. is involved with its target, GrabAGun) that faded, only to bounce back strongly. When I covered the name in February, CLBR was barely above its redemption price; it's since gained 35%. CLBR was probably a better trade than CCCM; the structure here (particularly as the adjustment shares are understood) seems like it's leading toward a quite high redemption rate. Given that the premium to BTC for a treasury company is based on sentiment, the early response to the merger announcement itself is a red flag longer-term. But with 4-5% downside, and the volatility inherent in anything remotely exposed to crypto, CCCM seems like an interesting trade, too — at least until shares no longer can be redeemed.

2025-06-29T13:38:08,"Ethereum Price Prediction: $10,000 Target Returns Amid Multi-Cycle Ascending Channel – Is ETH Ready?","During the US session on Sunday, Ethereum (ETH) is looking strong at $2,457, up 1.27% on the day. This is in line with the growing chatter that ETH could reach $10,000 in this cycle, as it has been stuck in a multi-year channel since 2017. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlights the significance of Ethereum’s long-term rising trend. Historical touchpoints along the lower band of this channel have triggered massive rallies, with increases of up to 300x in 2017 and 50x in 2020. While such extreme multiples are less likely now due to ETH’s $292 billion market cap, Pillows believes a climb toward $10,000 remains plausible. Analyst Spots Long-Term Pattern That Could Send ETH to $10,000 https://t.co/8E8yK0cuaK #Crypto #Ethereum — Coindoo.com (@coindoo) June 29, 2025 However, technical resistance must first be overcome. ETH was twice rejected near $2,600 in June. Analysts like Crypto Patel signal a clean break, and a close over $2,800 would confirm a bullish shift, potentially targeting $4,000 and beyond. Whale Activity and Withdrawals Reflect Long-Term Belief On-chain data supports the bullish thesis. Whale wallets and institutions are steadily accumulating ETH, even as price action remains range-bound. Lookonchain reports SharpLink Gaming acquired $4.82 million worth of ETH OTC, raising its total exposure to $478 million. Sharplink Gaming bought another $4,820,000 $ETH via OTC. They now hold $425,470,000 Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/0QtDdHcUAS — Ted (@TedPillows) June 28, 2025 Additional signs of confidence: $4.56M deposited into Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, likely for staking $293M withdrawn from exchanges—suggesting a move to cold wallets Low volatility accompanied by high-value transfers These patterns suggest whales are preparing for future appreciation rather than trading short-term moves. Network Growth vs Market Price: Disconnect or Opportunity? Ethereum’s network activity is surging. Daily transactions have topped 1.5 million, and active addresses exceed 356,000—the highest levels since early 2023. Gas fees have jumped 130% in a week, reaching $10.26M, indicating increased demand for DeFi and NFT platforms. Despite this, ETH’s price lags. Key valuation indicators reflect caution: NVT Ratio spiked to 2044—implying price may be ahead of usage MVRV Z-score dipped into negative territory, suggesting holders are underwater This disconnect between price and fundamentals could be a hidden buying opportunity—or a sign of excessive hype. Bitcoin Final Take: Breakout Depends on Key Levels Although the Ethereum price prediction remains bullish, is it really heading toward $10,000? Well, that depends on: Break above $2,800 to confirm the trend Whale interest and staking flows to stick Network usage to translate into price gains If ETH maintains its support around $2,400 and Bitcoin’s dominance stabilizes, Ethereum may follow with a breakout. Analysts at XForceGlobal expect a Wyckoff-style move toward $9,400 if momentum builds. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For now, ETH’s bullish trajectory is intact—but upside depends on reclaiming key resistance levels and validating long-term investor conviction through sustained volume and accumulation. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.74M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.74 million in its public presale, with $1,748,091.98 raised out of a $1,974,249 target. The token is priced at $0.012075, with the next price tier expected within hours. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging.
