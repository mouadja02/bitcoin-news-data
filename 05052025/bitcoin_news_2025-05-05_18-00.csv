The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations. Bitcoin percent supply in profit. Source: X.comBitcoin's price staged a recovery from its long-term cumulative mean percentage in profit, marking a notable shift. Previously, in August 2024, Bitcoin retested the 75% mean at around $60,000. This suggests that the price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent the bottom, aligning with the structural market conditions observed in Q3 2024.Confirming the decrease in holder sales through exchanges, the total exchange flow (inflow + outflow) to network activity ratio provides further insight. Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. explained that the chart shows a 1.5x decrease in ratio following Bitcoin’s all-time high, directly confirming that the current growth is more organic.Bitcoin exchange flows to the network activity ratio. Source: Axel Adler Jr. The analyst explained that, unlike previous price peaks, where a high ratio (marked by orange bars) signaled heavy selling, current levels show no such urgency, reinforcing a more stable market environment.High profitability and reduced exchange inflows indicate diminished selling pressure from holders, enabling an improved holder’s mindset between $75,000 and $95,000. This suggests that investors viewed BTC as undervalued and not as an exit opportunity, which aligned with the broader bullish sentiment.

But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher? BTC price jumped 6x last time gold rallied  Bitcoin has historically delivered far more substantial gains than gold when their markets rally concurrently.

He links this bold target to Trump’s tariff policies, which he believes could weaken the US dollar by around 25%, boosting gold’s appeal alongside strong central bank demand and underweight investor positioning.Holmes predicts that Bitcoin could break through its $97,000 supply overhang and climb to $120,000–$150,000 in the near term, with a longer-term potential of reaching $250,000 as adoption accelerates.BTC can hit $155K if gold’s lagging correlation holdsIn late April, gold climbed to an all-time high of $3,500, up 33.35% year-to-date (YTD).

2025-05-05T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto market manipulation schemes are becoming increasingly coordinated","Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXCMarket manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.A tale as old as time Market manipulation is as old as markets themselves. In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Thales of Miletus used his knowledge of weather patterns to predict a bumper olive harvest, quietly leasing all the olive presses in the region at a low rate before the season started. Then, when the harvest came in, and demand for presses spiked, he rented them out at inflated prices, pocketing the difference. For a more recent historical example, albeit still 300 years in the past, see the South Sea Company bubble in which company directors dumped shares at peak prices, leaving regular investors rekt. Or the Dutch tulip bubble of a century earlier. Market manipulation has existed in crypto since the first exchanges came onstream around 2011. Those who were around back then may recall the pump-and-dump schemes on the BTC-E exchange orchestrated by a notorious trader called Fontas. Or they might remember Bear Whale, whose 30,000 BTC sell wall crashed the market at a time when total daily trading volume was less than $30 million — for all of crypto combined. While not technically market manipulation, it showed how easily one individual could move the crypto market.Fast forward to today, and crypto is a multi-trillion dollar asset class, rendering manipulation of large-cap assets virtually impossible for solitary whales. But when a group of nefarious traders team up, it's still possible to move markets — and well-organized insiders are doing just that.Manipulators make their moveThe days when a single whale could set a BTC sell wall that took weeks to topple are long gone. While crypto is magnitudes more liquid these days, it's also much more fragmented. This presents opportunities to enterprising traders who hunt in packs to move markets to their advantage. Often working through private Telegram groups, people coordinate activities targeting markets where they can have the most effect. The trend highlights the growing participation of major players in market manipulation schemes, presenting a new level of risk for the crypto industry. Recent: What are exit liquidity traps — and how to detect them before it is too lateIn February, analyst James CryptoGuru warned of large-scale manipulation risks involving spot Bitcoin ETFs. He explained that these instruments could put downward pressure on Bitcoin's price — particularly when traditional financial markets are closed. Such a strategy could trigger liquidations among leveraged traders and create temporary imbalances, allowing large players to accumulate BTC and ETH at discounted prices.Because crypto — both onchain and on-exchange — is highly interconnected, the ripple effects of a successful manipulation attempt extend far and wide. If a trading pair queried by APIs for feeding other markets is knocked out of sync on one centralized exchange, it can generate arbitrage opportunities elsewhere, including on perps markets. As a result, an attack can be initiated on one exchange, and the profits claimed on another, making it extremely hard to catch the culprits.The integrity of the cryptocurrency market faces increased risk. Coordinated groups have deep pockets, technical tools, and cross-platform access to execute and mask complex operations. The troubling part is that most exchanges remain reactive by design since it's virtually impossible to prevent market manipulation. As a result, attackers have a high chance of retaining the advantage, even if the window in which they're free to run amok is becoming increasingly smaller.Not all manipulators break the rulesJust as Thales of Miletus wasn't breaking the rules when he profited off olive season, much of what constitutes crypto manipulation isn't illegal. When a large fund starts buying a particular token through one of their public wallets to attract attention — is that manipulation? Or when market makers go beyond simply matching bid-ask spreads to actively propping up a token's price at the request of a project? Many things move markets, but mostly things that aren't illegal — at least not now.While the moral code governing influencers, market makers, trading firms, and other players of serious size can be debated at length, other cases require less nuance. The last time anyone checked, using thousands of exchange accounts staffed by dozens of users to inflate a particular asset is blatant manipulation. Exchanges, aided by increasingly sophisticated AI-powered tooling, are fighting back.The days when one user would cause mayhem on the markets may be over. The threat hasn't, however, dissipated in the multichain, multi-exchange era — it's multiplied. As a result, exchanges are now locked into a game of whack-a-mole, trying to detect suspicious behavior initiated by hundreds or thousands of accounts simultaneously.Thankfully, exchanges don't have to do it alone, as successful collaboration cases show. When Bybit was hacked in early 2025, other platforms stepped in to lend ETH and help it meet its withdrawal obligations — a rare but powerful sign of solidarity in the face of crisis.As well-funded, highly organized groups continue to test the system, one thing becomes clear: manipulating the market may be relatively easy — but doing so without being detected is increasingly difficult. Collective vigilance, data sharing, and early detection are becoming the most effective tools in safeguarding the integrity of the crypto trading ecosystem.Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXC.

2025-05-05T14:08:00.000Z,"How a $243 million crypto heist led to a real-world kidnapping","$243M Bitcoin scam that led to kidnapping and chaos              In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.It all started when a Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency investor received a suspicious phone call. The person on the other end posed as a security representative from Google. A second call came from someone claiming to be with Gemini, a well-known crypto exchange.What followed was a textbook case of social engineering. The scammers convinced the victim to download software that gave them remote access to his computer. Moments later, 4,100 Bitcoin worth $243 million at the time vanished from his wallets.And that’s when things really got weird.                  How crypto detectives unmasked the thieves behind the $243M heist              The crypto world may seem like the Wild West, but it has its sheriffs. One of them is ZachXBT, a pseudonymous investigator revered for his blockchain detective work.ZachXBT was walking through an airport when he got an alert about suspicious transactions. By the time he was in the air, he’d already traced the stolen funds to a mysterious wallet.Within hours, he and a team of independent investigators started tracking the money across dozens of exchanges, even notifying the platforms to freeze the assets.But the real breakthrough? A video.A source anonymously sent ZachXBT screen recordings of the thieves celebrating the heist, cheering over Discord and flashing millions on-screen. One of them accidentally revealed his real name: Veer Chetal, an 18-year-old honor student from Danbury, Connecticut.Yes, the same Danbury where the kidnapping took place.Did you know? In January 2025, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France and later safely released following a police intervention. The abduction was linked to a cryptocurrency ransom demand, highlighting the growing intersection of digital assets and real-world crime.                  Real-world consequences: The kidnapping of Veer’s parents              Just one week after the digital heist, Sushil and Radhika Chetal (Veer’s parents) were house-hunting in their $240,000 Lamborghini Urus when two vehicles ambushed them. Authorities have described Veer’s parents solely as victims of the kidnapping, with no indication they were involved in the crypto theft.Reportedly, armed attackers dragged the couple into a van, bound them with duct tape and fled the scene. Thankfully, quick-thinking bystanders (including an off-duty FBI agent) helped police track the van. The Chetals were rescued, and four of the six suspects were caught within hours.But why target the parents?It turned out the motive was chilling: Veer’s co-conspirators wanted to extort him. They knew he was involved in the crypto theft. Now, they viewed his parents as leverage to force him to share the loot — or more of it.From Minecraft to multimillion-dollar crimeVeer Chetal wasn’t just some teenager with a knack for crypto. He was allegedly part of “the Com,” an underground online collective that evolved from Minecraft servers and video game scams into a sophisticated criminal network involved in everything from SIM swapping to crypto fraud.His path from honor student to alleged cybercriminal seems to have accelerated fast. Classmates noticed him suddenly showing up to school in a Corvette, then a BMW, then a Lamborghini. He threw parties on yachts and wore luxury brands that most teens have only seen in rap videos.His digital partner in crime? Malone Lam, a Singaporean hacker known in online circles as “Greavys” and “Anne Hathaway.” After the heist, Lam blew through millions on nightclubs, cars and champagne in Los Angeles and Miami, even trolling ZachXBT online by holding up signs mocking him in clubs.                  The collapse: Arrests, raids and guilty pleas              The lavish lifestyle didn’t last long. The FBI, aided by crypto investigators, tracked Lam, Veer and others across states and continents.Here’s what happened:Lam was arrested in Miami after a SWAT-style raid on a mansion he’d rented.Another suspect was caught at LAX wearing a $500,000 watch.Veer was quietly arrested, too, the son of the kidnapped couple, and is now facing federal charges.By March 2025, five out of six of the Florida-based kidnappers had pleaded guilty. They face up to 15 years in prison. Others involved in the digital theft are still under investigation, and a federal wallet now holds the recovered Bitcoin.Did you know? Despite using sophisticated laundering methods, one co-conspirator failed to use a VPN, exposing his location through an IP address tied to a high-end rental. Authorities traced him to Jeandiel Serrano, aka VersaceGod, who was enjoying a vacation in the Maldives by the time they caught up with him.                  The growing link between digital crime and real-world consequences              What’s frightening is how seamlessly this crime flowed from the digital world into the physical. As cybersecurity expert Allison Nixon put it: “We are seeing an evolution from disorganized crime to organized crime, and we are somewhere in the middle point of that.”Groups like the Com are no longer just pranksters or hackers; they're hardened, organized, and increasingly violent. They share success stories and flaunt wealth, recruiting the next generation through Discord, Telegram and Minecraft.The $243 million crypto heist that led to a real-world kidnapping is more than just a headline. It’s a warning. It shows how cybercrime no longer stays online, and how youthful arrogance, digital anonymity and unchecked greed can have very real-world consequences.And as fast as this group got rich, they got caught even faster.Ultimately, not even Lamborghinis and champagne could protect them from the blockchain breadcrumbs they left behind.                  The dark side of crypto and the need for vigilance              While cryptocurrency offers many advantages, it also has a darker side that cannot be ignored. The very features that make crypto attractive — decentralization, anonymity and ease of transfer — are also what make it a breeding ground for illegal activities. From money laundering and fraud to scams and cybercrime, crypto has become a tool for a wide range of criminals. The lure of quick profits and easy money, combined with the anonymity of digital currencies, makes crypto especially appealing to young, impressionable individuals. Many are introduced to it through seemingly harmless channels, such as online gaming or social media, where they may encounter cybercriminals looking to recruit the next generation of offenders. This makes it all the more important for parents and guardians to stay aware of their child’s digital activities and online behavior.Cryptocurrency is not inherently dangerous, but it can open the door to hazardous paths if misused. For those new to the space, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. Scammers can use sophisticated techniques to deceive and steal, and the lack of regulation can leave victims without recourse. As crypto continues to grow in popularity, the potential for cybercrime will likely expand, and the consequences of digital theft could become more severe and tangible.Keeping an eye on your child's digital activityWith the rise of cryptocurrencies, it’s essential for parents to educate their children about the risks associated with digital assets. Keeping an eye on their online interactions, including the apps, games and forums they frequent, is critical in ensuring they don't fall prey to digital criminals. Encouraging open conversations about internet safety, teaching them about the dangers of sharing personal information online and monitoring their digital wallets are simple yet effective ways to protect them from the darker side of crypto.As the boundaries between the digital world and real-world consequences continue to blur, it’s important to stay vigilant. Whether it’s ensuring your child’s safety in the digital space or understanding the broader risks posed by crypto, being proactive can help navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance. By taking precautions and staying informed, you can harness the benefits of cryptocurrency while minimizing its dangers.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-a-243-million-crypto-heist-led-to-a-real-world-kidnapping?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.“President Trump’s announcement promises exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for significant investment in one of the President’s business ventures,” a letter co-signed by California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff read.A call for impeachment over a memecoinAlso in late April, Senator Jon Ossoff expressed support for impeaching Trump during an April 25 town hall, citing the president’s plan to host the dinner for top TRUMP memecoin holders. He said:“When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him. There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.”Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis and at least one other Republican in Congress were reportedly also critical of Trump for offering the top holders of his memecoin a dinner and White House tour. Lummis, of Wyoming, reportedly said that the US president offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.”In a May 4 post on X, Warren claimed the Trump family’s stablecoin surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates,” which involved settling the investment using USD1. She argued this raised serious national security concerns and warned against the Senate passing crypto-friendly legislation.Warren expressed concerns around foreign involvement in the US president’s finances. She also suggested that the Senate should refrain from approving pro-crypto bills:“The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption.“Related: America’s crypto renaissance is already failing; but we can fix itSource: Elizabeth WarrenWarren’s post included a clip from a recent interview during which Trump gave conflicting answers to whether he has profited from the crypto memecoin he launched in January, just days before he reentered the White House.

It doesn’t make sense.”Much like the memecoin, the USD1 stablecoin also attracted its fair share of criticism.

As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level and falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are struggling to keep XRP above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2.18, signaling a lack of strength.If this trend continues, a close below the moving averages, namely the 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA at $2.06, could sink the XRP/USDT pair to the psychological support level at $2.00. Related: Is XRP price going to crash again?If this support fails, XRP price could tumble toward the downside target at around $1.20 by the end of May, down 45% from current price levels.XRP’s descending triangle target echoes an earlier analysis that warned of a possible decline to as low as $1.61 if key support levels don’t hold.Conversely, a clear breakout above the triangle’s resistance line at $2.18 will invalidate the bearish structure, putting XRP in a good position to rally toward the $3.00 psychological level.Declining XRP network activityThe XRP Ledger has experienced a significant drop in network activity compared to Q1 2025. Onchain data from Glassnode shows that the network's daily active addresses (DAAs) are now far below March's peak. On March 19, the ledger recorded a robust 608,000 DAAs, reflecting high user engagement and transaction activity. However, this metric crashed in April and early May, as shown in the chart below. With only around 30,000 daily active addresses, user transactions have decreased, possibly signaling reduced interest or a lack of confidence in XRP's near-term outlook.XRP Daily Active Addresses. Source: GlassnodeHistorically, declines in network activity typically signal upcoming price stagnation or drops, as lower transaction volume reduces liquidity and buying pressure.Meanwhile, XRP’s 1.17% drop over the last 24 hours is accompanied by a 30% increase in daily trading volume to $2 billion. Trading volume increases amid a price decline can be interpreted as profit-taking or repositioning by crypto traders as they wait for XRP’s next move. Popular analyst Dom commented on the increased selling volume, pointing out that “a large amount of market selling over the last week” is why XRP failed to sustain upward moves. Source: DomThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He noted that consumer-focused applications, in particular, are thriving in the network.Web2.5 is a term used to describe platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. These applications avoid full decentralization, often drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

Source: CointelegraphConsumer-focused Web2.5 platforms generate revenue on AptosPampati told Cointelegraph that one of the trends he sees within the Aptos ecosystem is that founders want to build “great consumer experiences.” He said the Aptos network was built to support projects with almost a Web2-like scale. Because of its Meta origins, Aptos has a developer stack focusing on abstracting friction away from Web3. Pampati described this as more of a Web2 user experience “without sacrificing Web3 principles.” He said platforms that followed such models had found success within the ecosystem:“We see a lot of great consumer Web 2.5 platforms emerging. So, those that are focused on distribution and those that are focused on fan loyalty are also generating tons of revenue because they've created great products.”Pampati said the trend is mainly influenced by their developer stack and what the Aptos platform offers, which focuses on broad consumer applications. Related: From digital identity to outer space: Projects push crypto use casesThe challenge of attracting the next million usersWhile Web2.5 applications address some of the user experience problems for crypto and Web3, Pampati said that one of the challenges in the space remains the onboarding of non-crypto natives to the industry. “I think the biggest challenge is trying to predict the next catalyst that pulls forward the next million, 10 million users into crypto. I think there’s a lot of tendency to go and refight old wars,” Pampati told Cointelegraph, adding that founders often move back into concepts like memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Still, he said, finding the next catalyst to spur broader mainstream adoption will require creating something new. Pampati added that collaborating and motivating founders to “see through the corners and not just try to recreate what’s already been created before” remains a challenge.

2025-05-05T10:00:28.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin says rollups must prove security before decentralizing","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has explained when he believes rollup-based layer-2 platforms should go decentralized, and why “as soon as possible” is not the correct answer.In a May 5 X post, Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“Rollup development is classified into stages: stage zero, stage one and stage two. Each stage is increasingly decentralized, with stage two being fully decentralized and trustless.Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyondCode that experienced warCryptocurrency systems that manage significant assets are exposed to profit-motivated bad actors worldwide. Even if a project does not feature a bug bounty program promising payments to people who find vulnerabilities, it is still taken apart under a microscope — it may just pay more for found faults.This threat is growing as nation-state-backed bad actors increase their crypto activity level. One such example is the Lazarus hacking group, responsible for many high-profile hacks in the crypto space, including the $1.4 billion ByBit hack.Wang suggested introducing a new metric for veteran code that survived the pressure of being exposed to highly motivated advanced hackers and hacker groups: “BattleTested.”  The BattleTested badge would be awarded to a rollup that consistently secured at least $100 million of assets for at least six months, with at least $50 million being in Ether (ETH) and a major stablecoin.Also, this badge would be lost at every update, as the new code needs to survive the onslaught of attackers to earn it as well. Buterin commented on the analysis:“A good reminder that stage 2 is not the only thing that matters for security: the quality of the underlying proof system matters too.“Analyst at Kronos Research Dominick John told Cointelegraph that “to responsibly transition from stage 1 to stage 2, rollup teams must […] take a hard look at correlated risks like shared custody weaknesses or geopolitical chokepoints that can compromise the reliability of multisig security councils.” He said that such risks often go unnoticed until the locked value crosses $100 million. He added:“The real green light for decentralization comes not when the proof system looks good on paper, but when it proves under real economic pressure that it’s more reliable than the potential for coordinated failures among council members.“Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 yearsWhen to go decentralized?Buterin explained that the best time for a protocol to go decentralized is when its onchain proof system is safe enough for the centralized components serving as a centralized point of failure or collusion risk to be the bigger threat. This is because until a system is proven to be secure enough, decentralization, which increases the reliance on this system, may end up making the system less secure.Chart showing example rollup risk analysis per stage. Source: Vitalik ButerinMike Tiutin, chief technology officer at decentralized compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “going decentralized too early […] can leave users vulnerable.” John explained that “decentralization isn’t a race, it’s a long-term responsibility shared by the entire ecosystem.” He explained that rushing to stage two puts ideology before safety and increases risks:“In stage one, councils can step in if something breaks. In Stage 2, a single bug could wipe out billions with no rollback.”While going decentralized right away is recognized as problematic, many experts highlight the issue of not going decentralized at all. Arthur Breitman, co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told Cointelegraph that “prominent Ethereum L2s” are “fundamentally custodial”:“Privileged entities control core logic, jeopardizing asset integrity; banking on their immunity to collusion is fragile, and failure is likely to be correlated.“Magazine: What are native rollups?

Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to create the conditions that would make that happen. Killing crypto in AmericaEvery crypto project faces the same fundamental problem: Achieving decentralization is critical to avoid regulatory scrutiny, but until a project launches its token, a degree of centralization is unavoidable.The SEC’s outdated Howey test ensures that nearly every legitimate crypto project gets classified as a security. The logic is self-defeating. Projects can’t decentralize without launching a token, but launching a token in the US instantly puts them in the SEC’s crosshairs.This isn’t just a theoretical issue; it has real consequences. Liquidity providers, essential for all new token launches, won’t engage with US-based projects because they assume their tokens will be classified as securities. Centralized exchanges refuse to list tokens issued from US entities for the same reason. Even decentralized exchanges face pressure from their legal teams to avoid actively seeding liquidity for American projects. The result? US founders are boxed out of the global crypto economy before they even get started.Offshore jurisdictions are winningThis regulatory failure has spawned an entire cottage industry of offshore legal firms specializing in setting up token-issuing entities. With its FINMA no-action letter system, Switzerland has become a hotbed for crypto projects because it offers one of the few structured ways to get legal clarity on a token’s classification. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands have also established themselves as crypto safe havens, providing flexible corporate structures that allow projects to operate with far less regulatory risk. Recent: US Treasury wants to cut off Huione over ties to crypto crimeThe absurdity is that the actual work — the development, the hiring, the innovation — still happens in the US. The token issuance gets pushed offshore via “Associations” and “Foundations,” which serve non-profits operating independently of US-based development shops. American founders are forced to funnel money into unnecessary legal fees, overseas operators, and shell foundations to avoid the inevitable crackdown from US regulators. This isn’t just bad for crypto; it’s bad for America. Until it can be solved, the US will continue to hemorrhage talent, investment, and influence to less myopic jurisdictions.Make America crypto-friendlyThe US has spent years fumbling crypto policy, and now, even with an administration that claims to be pro-crypto, it’s still failing to deliver real change. The solution isn’t to promise capital gains tax exemptions on crypto, as some have suggested. That does little to ameliorate the punishing regulatory landscape US-based projects are forced to navigate. If the US truly wants to lead in crypto, it also must take the lead in providing regulatory clarity.That means finally recognizing that the same regulations that have governed traditional financial markets can’t always be applied to crypto. The Howey test doesn’t work. Instead, the government must provide a new and functional legal framework for the crypto industry. It’s time for US legislators and regulators to acknowledge that crypto tokens can’t achieve decentralization instantaneously and almost always require the efforts of a team of core contributors to bootstrap initial growth and development. The federal government must devise a version of the Howey test that does not automatically classify every new crypto token as a security but instead allows tokens a grace period to decentralize. In conjunction with this, the US must establish new protections to ensure insiders aren’t unduly benefiting from crypto projects while they scale. In addition to swiftly ending the “regulation by enforcement” approach employed under Gary Gensler’s SEC, a tactic seemingly designed to gradually smother crypto activity in the US, the government must provide clear guidelines. It needs to be feasible for market makers to evaluate whether US tokens are commodities or securities with a degree of stability and predictability. This is the only way to end the blanket bans market makers have placed on US tokens and bring crypto development back to America.America’s window of opportunity is closingCrypto founders aren’t waiting for Washington to figure it out. Every day, without clear regulations, more crypto projects are incorporated offshore. The US doesn’t even need to “embrace” crypto. It just needs to stop actively driving it away.If this administration truly wants to make the US the leader in crypto, it needs to move beyond campaign slogans and start fixing the fundamental problems that forced this industry offshore in the first place. And it needs to act fast. Opinion by: Shane Molidor, Founder, Forgd. This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: KomdigiSabar said proper supervision would require active participation from the community. “We invite the public to help maintain a safe and trusted digital space for all citizens,” he said. “Komdigi also appeals to the public to remain vigilant against unauthorized digital services, and to immediately report suspected violations through the official public complaint channel.”The community response has been divided over the action by Komdigi.“Good job Indonesia — at least somebody is standing up to that scam,” one Reddit user wrote.Related: From digital identity to outer space: Projects push crypto use casesOthers fired back, hinting at potential benefits stemming from World’s offering in Indonesia for the general public.“If giving up your iris biometrics means you can feed your loved ones for a few weeks, that might be a trade worth making. In the end, it all depends on what matters most to you,” another Redditor said.World’s latest news from Indonesia follows World’s debut in the United States in May 2025, with the platform rolling out its digital identity tech in six cities initially.A number of global regulators were pushing back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of biometric data passed by users.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/indonesia-suspend-world-id-registration-rule-violation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-05T08:24:15.000Z,"Notcoin says tap-to-earn ‘probably dead’ as Telegram games see shift","Notcoin, one of the most prominent Web3 gaming projects of 2024, said the tap-to-earn genre is “probably dead” as Web3 gaming shifts to more fun and engaging projects.During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for Not Games, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different game genres as tap-to-earn failed to sustain players’ interests. “We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said. Notcoin’s Sasha (left), and Vladimir Plotvinov (middle), and Uliana Salo (right) at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphGamers want a “fun time” with friends In 2024, Notcoin was one of Telegram’s most popular tap-to-earn games, onboarding more than 30 million users within three months of its release. In a previous interview, Sasha attributed the game’s growth to its ability to “solve the issue” of onboarding Telegram users into crypto. While Telegram gaming exploded in 2024, gamers soon went game-hopping, moving to other games as soon as they “farmed” what they could in one project. Sasha told Cointelegraph: “Users who come to farm — their motivation is just to earn something. And with games, it’s more like I have fun, I want to play with my friends, and I want to play within a group.”He added that while Telegram’s first wave of games didn’t provide that social element, Web3 can still play a vital role in the platform’s gaming ecosystem.He told Cointelegraph that Telegram games started to shift to models that move away from simply “farming” tokens. In these new experiences, the Web3 economy part becomes an “add-on” instead of the main value proposition. However, development may take some time. Sasha told Cointelegraph that Telegram has no “real games” yet, but is optimistic for the future.How artificial intelligence improves Web3 gaming developmentVladimir told Cointelegraph that artificial intelligence and Telegram have made creating games easier for Web3 developers. The Notcoin co-founder said that the advent of AI technology allowed developers to be faster and more efficient when writing game code:“It saves time. My speed of delivery becomes faster. I write code faster than usual because I save a lot of time on other easy tasks.”However, he urged developers to pay attention when using AI when creating their projects. “You have to pay a lot of attention, have the expertise and experience because you have to see like how the API will work, how it will be connected to each other, how it will work on high load with a lot of users,” Vladimir said. Related: Web3 games with one wallet still the vision for players — The SandboxTelegram Web3 gaming to grow exponentiallyWhen asked if Telegram’s Web3 gaming industry will still grow despite the perceived death of tap-to-earn, Salo told Cointelegraph that Telegram has a market similar to Facebook and WeChat, which are platforms with their own gaming ecosystems. “We believe in our chances because we already have a similar platform like WeChat and Facebook that already have their game ecosystems, and it’s a huge market. The number of users is practically the same,” she said. Salo noted that Telegram’s gaming scene currently lacks major publishers and investor funding, but she expects exponential growth.  Salo added that they’re trying to get to a point where gamers play not just to get tokens but because it’s fun. “We're trying to get this extra part, like this ‘fun’ with something that people are doing not only for money, just for themselves,” Salo said. Magazine: TV hit Peaky Blinders to launch crypto game, FIFA Rivals on Polkadot: Web3 Gamer",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/notcoin-telegram-gaming-tap-to-earn-dead-token2049?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-05T08:05:00.000Z,"How cybercriminals are exploiting digital twins to scam crypto users","What is a digital twin?              A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In essence, they help prevent costly mistakes by modeling complex systems in the virtual world before implementing them in the real world.Digital twins have taken on a darker role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Cybercriminals use digital twin technology rather than simulating physical objects to create synthetic identities, replicas of real individuals, often derived from stolen data. These digital copies are then used to infiltrate online communities, impersonate influencers or executives, or manipulate systems for financial gain.                  How cybercriminals weaponize digital twins to scam crypto users              In the crypto world, where anonymity and trustless transactions reign supreme, digital twins have emerged as a potent tool for cybercriminals to exploit. Scammers can take advantage of the decentralized, unregulated nature of crypto platforms to perpetrate these frauds.  Here’s a deeper look at how scammers weaponize digital twins:Identity cloning: Cybercriminals gather personal data from social media, data breaches and other online sources to create a highly accurate digital twin of a real person. This might include images, voice recordings, writing style and even behavioral patterns. Once the digital twin is created, it can be used to impersonate individuals and gain trust from others in the crypto community.Fake influencers or advisers: Crypto influencers, who often command significant trust and attention, are prime targets for digital twin scams. By replicating their speech patterns, mannerisms and even generating deepfake videos, scammers can pose as trusted personalities in the space. These fake versions may promote fraudulent investment schemes, fake tokens or manipulate users into sending crypto to scam wallets.Synthetic KYC (Know Your Customer) scams: Some digital twins are created to bypass KYC processes on exchanges or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Attackers can generate fake identities and provide forged documents or images to appear legitimate, gaining access to accounts or executing unauthorized transactions. This can enable criminals to launder stolen funds or impersonate legitimate traders.Phishing with personalization: Phishing scams in the crypto space often target individuals with highly personalized messages. When a scammer creates a digital twin of a known figure, they can tailor their communications to appear more convincing. By using these personalized messages, they trick victims into clicking on malicious links, giving away private keys or downloading harmful software.Did you know? In 2023, a Hong Kong finance employee was tricked into transferring $25 million after joining a video call with what turned out to be deepfake versions of their colleagues, generated using publicly available footage.                  Examples of digital twin-related scams in crypto              While digital twin scams in crypto might sound futuristic, they’re already happening, and AI is a big part of the problem. These scams don’t always rely on evil digital twins alone; many use deepfake videos, AI-generated profiles and hallucinated interfaces to deceive users. Here are some real-world examples:Deepfake CEO scam defrauds chief financial officer via video call: In a sophisticated attack, scammers created digital avatars of a company’s CEO and executives using publicly available video materials. They conducted a video call with the company’s chief financial officer, convincing him to transfer funds under false pretenses. The digital twins were so convincing that the executive did not suspect foul play during the call.UI spoofing mimics trusted crypto platforms: Cybercriminals have employed UI spoofing to create near-perfect replicas of legitimate cryptocurrency platforms. These counterfeit interfaces trick users into entering sensitive information or making transactions, believing they are interacting with the real platform. The high fidelity of these digital twins makes them particularly dangerous, as they can bypass traditional security measures.AdmiralsFX scam uses deepfakes to lure investors: A large-scale scam operated by a call center in Tbilisi, Georgia, used deepfake videos of celebrities to promote a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platform called AdmiralsFX. Victims were shown AI-generated videos of public figures endorsing the platform, leading them to invest substantial amounts of money. The operation defrauded over 6,000 individuals, highlighting the potent combination of deepfake technology and social engineering.                  How to spot interactions with evil digital twins: 6 Red flags              Digital twin scams rely on sophisticated impersonation techniques, and scammers often use synthetic identities to build trust and manipulate their targets. To help you stay alert, here are six red flags that can help you identify interactions with synthetic identities. Watch for these warning signs to protect yourself from falling victim to fraud.Digital twin scams in crypto often hide behind polished, AI-generated responses that sound perfect but lack authenticity. If someone avoids live video calls and instead offers pre-recorded clips or deepfakes, be skeptical. Real people show up. Scammers frequently use urgency, pushing you to act fast with phrases like “limited offer” to bypass your judgment. One major red flag is receiving unverified crypto requests via DMs — legit professionals don’t do that. Always check profiles for inconsistencies like low follower counts or recent creation dates. Finally, be wary if someone insists on sticking to one platform and refuses to switch to secure or verified channels. These tactics combined often signal a coordinated scam using digital twin or AI deception.Did you know? Unlike traditional simulations, digital twins are dynamic virtual environments powered by real-time data. While a simulation models one process, a digital twin can run multiple simulations at once, constantly learning and adapting through a live feedback loop.                  Can blockchain help prevent digital twin-powered crypto scams?              While blockchain technology is often targeted by cybercriminals due to its decentralized and pseudonymous nature, it also holds the potential to offer powerful solutions for combating digital twin-based scams.Blockchain, with its transparent and immutable features, provides unique tools that can help verify identities and secure transactions, making it harder for scammers to manipulate the system. Leveraging blockchain’s capabilities introduces robust security layers that verify the legitimacy of interactions, helping reduce fraud, identity theft and digital impersonation.Onchain identity verification: One of the most important developments in blockchain technology is the concept of decentralized identity (DID). With DID, individuals can verify their identity on the blockchain without relying on centralized authorities. This ensures that scammers cannot create synthetic identities without being detected. Blockchain provides a transparent, secure and verifiable system for managing identities, reducing the risk of impersonation.NFT identity markers: Some platforms use non-fungible tokens (NFT) as a form of digital identity. NFTs are unique and traceable on the blockchain, which makes it much harder to clone someone’s identity. If you’re engaging with a person who has a verified NFT identity, you can be more confident that they are who they claim to be.Immutable audit trails: Every transaction on the blockchain is permanently recorded and timestamped. This means that if someone tries to impersonate another person or create a fraudulent identity, their actions leave a trace. If a synthetic identity is used to scam individuals, the blockchain’s audit trail can help authorities track the perpetrator.Smart contract protections: Smart contracts on blockchain can be used to implement certain safeguards. For instance, smart contracts can include identity verification processes, ensuring that transactions aren’t processed unless the user’s identity is verified. This can help prevent users from sending crypto to scammers using fake identities.While not a silver bullet, blockchain can significantly strengthen trust and security in increasingly AI-powered digital environments.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-cybercriminals-are-exploiting-digital-twins-to-scam-crypto-users?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-05T08:04:30.000Z,"Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoption","Increasing institutional interest and moves toward legal frameworks for stablecoins have seen the space grow, with five major projects slated to expand the market in the near future. In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market. Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption.Tether to relaunch in the USStablecoin giant Tether is eyeing a relaunch in the US with a dollar-based stablecoin. Tether’s USDt (USDT) is already known worldwide as the largest stablecoin on the market, providing liquidity to crypto trading pairs on numerous exchanges. However, Tether has found itself in hot water with regulators over proof of its reserves, other financial transparency and Anti-Money Laundering concerns. In an April 30 interview with CNBC, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the firm wants to launch a rebranded coin in the US, separate from its ubiquitous international stablecoin. “A domestic stablecoin would be different from the international stablecoin,” he said.Tether holds the lion’s share of the stablecoin market. Source: NansenThe move would give Tether access to US financial markets as the latter’s exposure to crypto widens under the pro-crypto administration of US President Donald Trump.Trump dabbles in the dollar with USD1At the beginning of March, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the cryptocurrency project tied to the Trump family, launched its dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, on the BNB Chain and Ethereum.According to CoinMarketCap, the coin has over $2 billion in market capitalization at publishing time. The stablecoins follow other high-profile crypto projects that use the president’s personal brand as a marketing tool, namely the TRUMP and WLFI memecoins that launched ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Trump’s ability to influence stablecoin policy has led a group of US senators to call for an inquiry into his personal interests in the project, calling it a clear conflict of interest.

Bridge was founded by two former Coinbase executives, Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, in 2022 and competes with firms using the ubiquitous SWIFT global payments system. The stablecoin initiative is the latest development in the firm’s expanding crypto plans. After a false start on Bitcoin support in 2014, the firm began rebuilding its crypto team in earnest in 2021. On Oct. 9, 2024, the firm opened USDC support for users in 70 countries. UAE’s largest bank to issue stablecoinAbu Dhabi’s International Holding Company, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) partnered to launch a dirham-backed stablecoin on April 28.According to The National, FAB — the largest bank in the UAE — will issue the stablecoin on the ADI network pending approval from the central bank. The ADI network is a project of the ADI Foundation in Abu Dhabi, which itself is a nonprofit organization founded by Sirius International Holding, a local holding firm with a $243 billion market capitalization. The firms claim that the stablecoin will “have a significant impact on various industries, including finance, commerce, and trade.”Related: Stablecoin adoption grows with new US bills, Japan’s open approachVisa, SBI and Mastercard add more stablecoin support New stablecoin issuances are picking up the pace, and payments firms, banks and financial institutions are adding support for them as well.On April 28, international payments giant Mastercard partnered with OKX to expand its stablecoin card options, which allow cardholders to spend stablecoins through their Mastercard linked with prominent crypto firms. Two days later, Visa announced that it partnered with Stripe and Bridge on April 30 to offer stablecoin payments on its network in Latin America, starting with Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Chile.SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency subsidiary of the Japanese financial conglomerate SBI, said it was preparing to add support for USDC after local regulators softened their approach to foreign stablecoins. Pending formal approval, the trading platform will be one of the first in Japan to offer cryptocurrency trading in USDC (USDC).SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo shows the firm getting the go-ahead from Japanese regulators.

Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”Trump launched his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, according to CoinGecko.The token has been in a steady decline since launch, but it surged late last month after its website offered top holders a chance to dine with Trump on May 22. It's currently trading at $11.35, down nearly 85% from its peak.Trump was apparently unaware of his token’s recent surge, repeatedly asking how much it was now worth.  Two companies, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of Trump’s sprawling Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital, together own 80% of the token’s total 1 billion supply.Most of those tokens are locked up and will be released over the next three years. The first unlock on April 18 saw 40 million tokens, worth $454 million, go to CIC Digital. Trump-controlled entities own 80% of the TRUMP token supply, which will be released periodically until 2028. Source: Trump MemeTrump’s memecoin project has made at least $350 million so far, according to a March analysis from the Financial Times, which found those behind the token made $314 million from selling them and $36 million from fees.Trump has been criticized over his many crypto dealings, which his opponents say are a conflict of interest as he looks to unburden the sector from regulators. Even those in his own party, Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Lisa Murkowski, have criticized Trump’s dinner offer to his top tokenholders. Trump said during the interview that he would contribute his presidential salary “back to the government,” prompting Welker to ask if he would also contribute any potential crypto earnings.“I never thought of that,” Trump answered. “I mean, should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so.”Trump reiterates crypto commitmentIn a part of the interview, Trump made a meandering statement that reiterated his campaign promise to support crypto.“I want crypto. I think crypto’s important because if we don’t do it, China’s going to. And it’s new, it’s very popular, it’s very hot,” he said.Trump claimed former President Joe Biden “went after it violently, and then, before the election, he changed his tune entirely” to garner the crypto vote.

The Bitcoin faucets encouraged wallet creation and transactions, which assisted with the expansion of Bitcoin’s user base and network activity.Other websites such as FreeBitco.in started offering similar services between 2011 and 2013.

At its peak, the exchange facilitated around 30% of all Bitcoin transactions, according to Shrem’s personal page.In order to offer the instant Bitcoin purchases that Bitcoin’s first dominant exchange, Mt. Gox, lacked, BitInstant purchased Bitcoin from Mt. Gox in large batches before reselling it to customers nearly instantly.However, BitInstant’s business model faced scaling issues as its transaction volume grew. To support its expansion, the company received $100,000 from early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, with additional backing later coming from Erik Voorhees and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.BitInstant co-founders Gareth Nelson (left) and Charlie Shrem (right) pictured together at an industry event.

2025-05-05T05:32:12.000Z,"Industry calls for urgent crypto law reforms after Australian election","The Australian crypto industry has called on the newly reelected Labor government to urgently make digital asset legislation a top priority to ensure Australia doesn’t fall further behind global markets.The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days. Joy Lam, Binance’s head of global regulatory and APAC legal, said the exchange has been consulting with Treasury officials since late 2023 about its proposed legislation, and it was now time for action.“Timing is really quite critical now because obviously it's something that has been discussed and kicked around for quite a few years,” she told Cointelegraph. Coinbase managing director for APAC John O’Loghlen said the reelected Albanese Government has the “opportunity and the responsibility to move quickly on this issue” and called for a Crypto-Asset Taskforce to be established within its first 100 days “with the aim of bringing forward legislation that protects consumers, promotes innovation, and stops the exodus of talent and capital to other markets.”Reelected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Source: Anthony AlbaneseBTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said that “beyond the political implications, this result sets the stage for meaningful progress in Australia’s approach to digital asset regulation.”Lam noted that the UK released its draft regulations last week, stablecoin bills are moving forward in the US, and the EU has already implemented its MiCA legislation.“So there's a very clear shift. Everyone's moving towards providing the regulatory framework that is needed for the industry to develop in a sustainable way. So time is really of the essence now.”Draft crypto legislation within monthsTreasurer Jim Chalmers’ office told Cointelegraph that exposure draft legislation would be released sometime this year for consultation, and any legislated reforms would be “phased in over time to minimize disruptions to existing businesses.”Although the Treasury has draft legislation on “regulating digital asset platforms” and “payments system modernization” scheduled for release by the end of June, Lam isn’t confident. \""I don't know whether this quarter specifically is still sort of the timeline,” she said. Related: Australian election will bring pro-crypto laws either way While the ALP has been attacked by some over not taking any action in its first term in government, that may actually have resulted in a better outcome than legislation that took its cues from the approach of Joe Biden’s administration, which took a hard line on banks dealing with cryptocurrency and viewed most coins as securities. Industry figures report a noticeable evolution in the government’s approach to crypto between when proposals were first put out for consultation at the end of 2023 and when the Treasury released its much more positive “Statement on Developing an innovative Australian digital asset industry” in March this year.Australia Votes running tally on the Australian election. Source: ABC The statement sets out key priorities, such as using the existing Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) regime to underpin the regulation of Digital Asset Platforms and payment stablecoins. It’s focused on the safe custody of client assets by centralized providers and sidesteps issues around decentralized finance platforms. Lam welcomed the use of the AFSL regime. “Obviously, we don't need to reinvent the wheel,” she said. “It’s something that people know and understand. It's a pretty sensible move, and it’s also going to be much easier for regulators.”Tokenization and sandboxThe government will also review the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox, which aims to provide space for innovative digital asset startups to grow free of red tape. The statement also highlights opportunities with tokenization. Lam said the change in emphasis showed the government has been listening to the industry. “It reflects the industry feedback that they would have received in 2023 as a result of the consultation, as well as the changing landscape because obviously it’s been evolving pretty quickly internationally,” Lam said. “They do have the benefit now of looking at what has worked and hasn’t worked in other jurisdictions, and really building on those lessons.”Dea Markovy, policy director at Fireblocks, told Cointelegraph that “a lot of the groundwork and research is done” and it was looking broadly positive.“Of course, a lot of details are still to come around Australia’s Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs) regime. What is significant here is the willingness of the Government to cut through the complexity and uncertainty on crypto intermediaries licensing.” The securities regulator ASIC released its own crypto regulations proposals (INFO 225) in December, and feedback from those consultations will help inform the government's new legislation. “In essence, it details how different token issuances and crypto intermediation will fit into Australia’s existing securities legislation, providing for a transition period,\"" explained Markovy.The draft guidance suggests NFTs, in-game assets and memecoins are not financial products — the local equivalent of a “security” — while a yield-bearing stablecoin or a gold-backed token probably are.The Treasury statement also highlighted issues with debanking. Lam said that simply regulating the industry would go a long way toward solving the issue.“What we really want from governments and regulators is that clean licensing framework, because that goes a long way to mitigating the risk and giving the banks the comfort that they need,” she said. “And then, there’s probably going to need to be some additional guidance given to banks.”Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/industry-calls-urgent-crypto-law-reforms-after-australian-election?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-05T03:30:34.000Z,"OpenAI ignored experts when it released overly agreeable ChatGPT","OpenAI says it ignored the concerns of its expert testers when it rolled out an update to its flagship ChatGPT artificial intelligence model that made it excessively agreeable.The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post.The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.”“Unfortunately, this was the wrong call,” the company admitted. “The qualitative assessments were hinting at something important, and we should’ve paid closer attention. They were picking up on a blind spot in our other evals and metrics.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on April 27 that it was working to roll back changes making ChatGPT too agreeable. Source: Sam AltmanBroadly, text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weighting, impacting how the model responds.OpenAI said introducing a user feedback reward signal weakened the model’s “primary reward signal, which had been holding sycophancy in check,” which tipped it toward being more obliging.“User feedback in particular can sometimes favor more agreeable responses, likely amplifying the shift we saw,” it added.OpenAI is now checking for suck up answersAfter the updated AI model rolled out, ChatGPT users had complained online about its tendency to shower praise on any idea it was presented, no matter how bad, which led OpenAI to concede in an April 29 blog post that it “was overly flattering or agreeable.”For example, one user told ChatGPT it wanted to start a business selling ice over the internet, which involved selling plain old water for customers to refreeze. Source: Tim LeckembyIn its latest postmortem, it said such behavior from its AI could pose a risk, especially concerning issues such as mental health.“People have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn’t see as much even a year ago,” OpenAI said. “As AI and society have co-evolved, it’s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.”Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: Survey The company said it had discussed sycophancy risks “for a while,” but it hadn’t been explicitly flagged for internal testing, and it didn’t have specific ways to track sycophancy.Now, it will look to add “sycophancy evaluations” by adjusting its safety review process to “formally consider behavior issues” and will block launching a model if it presents issues.OpenAI also admitted that it didn’t announce the latest model as it expected it “to be a fairly subtle update,” which it has vowed to change. “There’s no such thing as a ‘small’ launch,” the company wrote. “We’ll try to communicate even subtle changes that can meaningfully change how people interact with ChatGPT.”AI Eye: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-ignored-experts-overly-agreeable-chatgpt-model-release?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

A super majority of Solana validators adopted the patches around two days later.Solana development firms Anza, Firedancer and Jito were the main parties behind the security patch, while Asymmetric Research, Neodyme and OtterSec also assisted.The foundation confirmed that all funds remain safe.Related: Bloomberg Intelligence boosts Solana ETF approval odds to 90%Despite the fix, the Solana Foundation's private handling of the issue with Solana validators raised centralization concerns from some in the crypto community. This included a Curve Finance contributor who raised concerns about the foundation’s close relationship with Solana validators.“Why does someone have a list of all validators and their contact details? What else are they talking about in those comms channels,” they asked, fearing that they could collude to potentially censor transactions or roll back the chain.Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko didn’t directly deny the claims but said members of the Ethereum community could also coordinate to resolve a similar security bug.Source: CloutedMore than 70% of Ethereum network validators are also controlled by crypto exchanges or staking operators such as Lido, Yakovenko said in arguing his point.“It’s the same people to get to 70% on ethereum.

2025-05-04T15:23:53.000Z,"How to set up stop-loss and take-profit orders","Key takeawaysBitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and profit-securing tool.They help reduce losses and boost revenue by automatically buying or selling an asset when its price reaches a set level. With Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009 and its subsequent trading on exchanges, these advanced trading strategy tools became crucial for dealing with its well-known price volatility. As Bitcoin (BTC) gained traction, traders began to use stop-loss and take-profit strategies from forex and stock markets. At first, price monitoring was manual. Then, automated features on crypto platforms changed everything.What are stop-loss and take-profit orders?Stop-loss and take-profit orders are trading strategies that help investors manage risk and secure gains automatically. They’re instructions you set on a trading platform to close a position when certain price levels are reached. They help limit losses in case of significant price drops or lock in profits when a price target is reached. They can be set up to boost gains and cut losses. This helps keep emotions out of trading, which can prevent regrettable mistakes. They also help if you can’t monitor the market constantly.There must be specific conditions for the orders to trigger. Bitcoin trading is very volatile. Its fast price changes and possible system delays can cause orders to trigger at a different price or not trigger at all. This type of trading strategy gives peace of mind to risk-averse investors.Bitcoin stop-loss ordersIf you don’t want to take risks and preserve your capital, you can use a stop-loss order designed to limit your losses. You can use it for a buy order, setting up a price level below your entry point, or right above it for a sell trade.In case of a price drop, the order is executed automatically at your designated price, preventing further losses. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a stop loss at $85,000, your position sells if the price drops to $85,000, capping your loss at $5,000.Bitcoin take-profit ordersTo lock in some gains, you can use a take-profit order. Set a price level above your entry point, and when the market reaches that level, the trade is executed, giving you the expected gains. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a take profit at $95,000, if the price hits $95,000, it sells, securing a $5,000 profit per BTC.Importance of stop loss and take profit for Bitcoin tradingBitcoin’s wild price changes make stop-loss and take-profit orders important. These tools help lower the risk of losses and boost the chance of gains.Remember, setting up these orders doesn’t guarantee they will be executed. Their execution relies on various factors, like market volumes.Why set up a stop loss for BitcoinBitcoin’s volatility has gone down over time. Still, it can have big price swings. Without proper Bitcoin trading risk management, traders may face heavy losses.Here are some of the most important reasons why it would be useful to adopt stop-loss orders in your Bitcoin trading strategy.Bitcoin volatility: BTC can still drop 10% in a very short time due to factors such as news, whale moves or market sentiment. On Dec. 5, 2024, for example, BTC suffered a flash crash from $103,853 down to $92,251 before recovering. A stop loss caps your downside trend when a flash crash hits. Without it, you’re gambling on timing the recovery manually.Non-stop market: The Bitcoin market is open 24/7. Setting up a stop loss will prevent losses due to sudden drops while you’re sleeping. Emotions: An emotional state can be a huge game-changer in trading. Emotional investors may panic-sell or panic-buy, triggering significant losses. A stop loss will reduce the risk of making costly emotional mistakes before fear kicks in.Why set up a take-profit order for BitcoinA Bitcoin trading strategy may include defining price targets and a percentage of gains. Setting up a take profit order for BTC may be necessary as part of an overall trading risk management plan and will help reach the following targets.Locking gains: BTC’s volatility, in both bull and bear markets, can lead to quick spikes and can reverse just as quickly. A take profit ensures you cash out before pullbacks.Greed control: Without a take profit order, traders may be tempted to chase higher highs, which may not occur over the short term.Non-stop market: You can’t just sit and watch the market 24/7. A take-profit order ensures profits in case of a sudden pump while you’re asleep.How to set up BTC stop-loss and take-profit ordersSetting up stop-loss and take-profit for Bitcoin trading varies by platform. However, the process is usually similar on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, Coinbase Pro and Kraken.The following step-by-step guide to setting up your BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders should give you a good overview of the process.Step 1: Choose a Bitcoin trading platformThis may be the most crucial aspect of your process to set up your advanced BTC trading strategies. Pick a platform that aligns with your needs. Make sure to check the fees, volumes, reputation and security because these features can impact your trading strategy.Step 2: Open a BTC trading positionOnce you’ve set up your trading account, log in to your platform and navigate to the trading section, and look for the order form. Choose a BTC pair, for example, BTC/USD.Place your buy order (long) or sell order (short). For example, you can place your order to buy 1 BTC at $90,000.Step 3: Set your stop loss for BTCHere’s an example of an order from the Kraken platform. Click on the stop-loss option from the order menu as shown below to set up the tool.Set the stop-loss price by first deciding your risk level, or how much you’re willing to lose in case the Bitcoin price drops significantly.For example, if you bought BTC at $92,500, you can set the stop loss at $87,300, meaning you set your loss at roughly 5.62%.The loss = 92,500 - 87,300 = 5,200Now, to find the percentage loss: (5,200 / 92,500) * 100 = 5.62%Step 4: Set your take profit for BTCStay in the same trade interface. Just as above, after you select your BTC pair and buy the relevant BTC amount, click on the take-profit option.Set the take-profit price based on your exit strategy. For example, you want to set it 5% above the entry price, which would be $94,500 if you bought BTC for $90,000.Enter $94,500 as the sell price. When Bitcoin hits this price, it will sell automatically.Step 5: Confirm and monitor your ordersConfirm and activate after double-checking the amount and price, then submit.If your notifications are active, you will receive one once the order is triggered.Nothing stops you from monitoring your order status, and you can cancel or amend it if the market conditions change.Best practices for BTC stop-loss placementTraders can limit their potential losses by using stop-loss orders. This helps them protect their capital during volatile market conditions. Therefore, with Bitcoin’s possible daily swings of 5%–10%, it’s safe to base a stop loss on volatility.Volatility: Platforms like TradingView might offer an option called Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days. This lets you set an average range below your entry point. For instance, you can choose a range of $3,000, so if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000, the order will trigger once it goes down to $87,000. Align with support levels: Historically, BTC respects price floors. Setting up a stop below a crucial support level gives some peace of mind. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000 and $88,000 is your support level, set a stop-loss order at $87,800, just below the zone to bypass stop-hunting bots.Avoid obvious levels: Whales and bots target batches of stop-loss orders at round numbers ($80,000, $85,000) or chart patterns, triggering orders before price reverses. Moving the stop loss a bit lower, like to $87,800 instead of $88,000, will probably trigger the order more effectively. BTC trailing stop lossA trailing stop-loss order automatically adjusts a stop-loss price as the market price moves in a profitable direction to lock in profits and limit losses by following a trade’s price. It’s designed to keep a fixed distance below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the current market price. A simple stop loss may miss profits, while a trailing stop locks them.You can set a trailing stop loss at 3%–5% below the peak as the price rises. If you buy BTC at $90,000 and it hits $95,000, the trailing stop loss moves to $93,250. You can adjust manually or automatically if the platform allows.Account for slippageSlippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. This can occur due to market volatility or low liquidity.In case of low liquidity during BTC crashes, execution can skip your stop loss. For instance, $88,000 may fill at $87,500. Widening the stop loss slightly by 0.5%–1% can solve the problem.How to adjust stop-loss and take-profit Bitcoin ordersWhen and how to adjust a stop lossStop-loss adjustments should be made carefully. This helps protect capital from unexpected market changes and secures profits when possible. It’s often done by adjusting the order to support or resistance levels. Another common strategy is using trailing stop-loss orders. You can use “modify position” or “edit trade” on your platform to adjust them.Tighten the stop loss after a move in your favor. In case BTC’s price rises after entry, you can move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profits. If BTC rises after entry, move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profit.For example, if BTC bounces from $88,000 to $93,000, you can tighten the stop loss to $90,500, thereby ensuring no loss if it is reversed.Trail the stop loss during a trend. As BTC keeps running upward during a bull market, trailing the stop loss captures more on the upside. A percentage- or ATR-based trail can be used. For instance, with a $90,000 entry, if BTC rallies to $100,000, you can trail the stop loss to $97,200 to lock in $7,200 per coin, which is an 8% profit if it then dips.Widen the stop loss during consolidation, as tight stop losses will get hit in unsettled ranges. For instance, if BTC stalls after the $90,000 entry, you can extend the stop loss from $88,000 to $87,500 to avoid sudden drops below support.Adjust before major events, like US Federal Reserve rate announcements or ETF approvals. These can cause big swings and increase slippage risks. You can tighten the stop loss to 1%–2% if you decide to remain in the trade, or you can widen it to 10% to ride the upward trend.When and how to adjust the take-profit orderTake-profit orders can be adjusted to maximize gains, adapting to momentum or resistance. Just like a stop loss, you can modify them on your trading platform by selecting the open trade and choosing the “modify position” or “edit trade” option. Extend the take profit during strong momentum. This is to avoid missing a peak in a bull run. If you see volume spiking or a breakout clearing resistance, you can push the take profit higher. For instance, you buy at $90,000 and set the take profit at $93,000. If BTC hits $92,500 fast, you can adjust the take profit to $95,000 or $97,000 to maximize profits.Take partial profits at key levels. Resistance levels like $85,000 or $90,000 often see BTC reversing. Then you can decide to sell some of your position to grab some gains and let the rest ride.Tighten the take profit near resistance levels. BTC usually stalls at round numbers or past highs. If the price approaches resistance, you can cut the take profit from $90,000 to $88,500, for example.Reset the take profit after a pullback. If you just missed a take profit trade, do not despair, as BTC usually retraces and then runs up again. If you enter the trade at $90,000 and BTC dips to $85,000, you can reset your take profit order to $87,000 or $88,000 for a moderate win.Common mistakes to avoid with BTC ordersBitcoin’s fast-moving market needs a solid trading strategy. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are key tools. However, if they aren’t set up properly, they could do more damage than benefit. Here are some common mistakes traders make with BTC orders and how to get around them.Setting stops too tightly: Placing a stop loss too close to an entry price means it may get hit by an average drop of 2%–3%. Always keep Bitcoin’s high volatility in mind and use volatility and support level metrics.Ignoring slippage: Slippage can occur due to high volatility or low liquidity. Ignoring it may lead to costly mistakes. Especially on leveraged orders, slippage may result in heavy losses, which may affect your risk plans. Widening the stop loss slightly during highly volatile times may help reduce the risk of big losses.Chasing round numbers: Setting a stop loss at a round number is not a good idea. This can attract bots and whales looking to hunt stops or dump orders. Always set it up $100–$500 below or above a round number to avoid being caught in this typical mistake.Forgetting to adjust: Leaving a stop loss at $88,000 and a take profit at $93,000 after BTC pumps to $95,000 means you may miss profits or risk a reversal. Regularly monitoring the BTC price will ensure you’re ahead of the game and can adjust the orders accordingly. Setting platform alerts is also useful.Misjudging market context: Use your judgment following market trends. Setting a tight stop loss before a Fed announcement or a wide take profit in a bearish trend may incur heavy losses. Adjust accordingly while following trends and sentiments. Tighten the orders pre-event and widen them post-event. Aligning a take order with resistance is also a good idea.Not accounting for fees: Large-scale orders may be subject to high fees, which should be accounted for when setting up orders. Always factor fees into targets, as in the long term, it will make a difference.Panic-canceling orders: Emotions can lead to big losses. So, it’s smart to stick to your initial plan. This is especially true for BTC, which often faces flash crashes but can recover quickly. You can use trailing stops to adjust automatically.Avoid these mistakes by planning strategically, staying disciplined and adapting to Bitcoin’s volatile nature. Always test strategies on a demo account before trading live.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-04T15:00:00.000Z,"Is this the end of Bitcoin DeFi?","Opinion by: Markus Bopp, CEO of TAP ProtocolNot long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term. If Bitcoin is to be treated like gold, it must be secured like gold. Very soon, we will see governments and institutions seek to secure Bitcoin in what will no doubt look like a digital Fort Knox. With more institutional and instrumental influence over the most valuable digital asset in the world, verifiable storage, hardened security protocols and structures built on resilience will become paramount. This shift could raise the stakes for developers. As institutional adoption rises, so does the demand for specialized developers capable of delivering institutional-grade security and long-term stability. What does this demand mean for the developer community that made Bitcoin what it is today? How will this affect the grassroots development built on Bitcoin’s core principles of full decentralization and transparency? Will a more institutional Bitcoin leave room for innovation, or is this the end of Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi)?Bitcoin’s institutional turn Bitcoin, the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, was designed to operate outside of traditional systems. Yet the moment governments and traditional institutions stopped keeping their distance, the future of Bitcoin has begun to pivot. What was once met with skepticism now draws a new kind of curiosity. The same players who once warned against digital assets are now staking their claims. The International Monetary Fund’s latest Balance of Payments Manual now classifies digital assets like Bitcoin as part of the international financial system, placing it firmly alongside traditional reserves and gold. As of January 2025, governments worldwide hold an estimated total of 471,000 BTC, worth over $16.3 billion. Strategy continued to lead and cross its Bitcoin holdings at a corporate level, doubling down on the cryptocurrency as a long-term strategic play. Recent: Bitcoin DeFi surge may boost BTC demand and adoption — BinanceThis kind of institutional recognition validates Bitcoin’s core principle but also throws it into flux. Holding it in sovereign reserves, governments are simultaneously affirming its legitimacy while also conforming it to the very system it was meant to disrupt. The changing developer landscapeAs the crypto landscape continues to evolve, fresh talent is still entering the space. There’s no guarantee all will stay. In 2024, the total number of developers in the industry declined by 7% year-on-year. Yet seasoned and established developers saw a 27% increase in activity, contributing to a record share of the industry’s output. While opportunities for small-scale contributors may be fading, the ecosystem supports a core of experienced builders, a signal that the space is maturing. The influx of institutional investors to crypto like Bitcoin is likely to drive up Bitcoin’s price, a consequence that might see them price out smaller developers and create an even higher barrier to entry. As the stakes around Bitcoin continue to rise, the demand is no longer just for innovation. It’ll be for security, compliance and infrastructure that can meet enterprise-grade “Fort Knox” level expectations. We’ll see a new wave of specialized developers stepping up to build intelligent, compliant and institutional-grade decentralized applications. From secure custody solutions to regulated exchanges and seamless bridges, institutional and government demands will shape the next phase of Bitcoin development.A new infrastructure As Bitcoin integrates more deeply into institutional finance, the development focus is maturing from experimentation to durability, compliance and security. Developers will likely focus on building not directly on Bitcoin but instead with Bitcoin. Bitcoin DeFi has so far been celebrated as a way to unlock open finance with the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, and it still might. Still, its future will depend on incoming compliance and regulatory frameworks. If governments go down the path of shoehorning the asset into traditional financial models, we’ll find developers seeking ways to bridge Bitcoin’s liquidity and value to more operable, friendlier chains. If governments are open to preserving Bitcoin’s core offering as a new, borderless and decentralized currency, that will signal the community to continue innovation. The question for the community then isn’t whether Bitcoin can support innovation under institutional oversight. It’s whether Bitcoin can thrive in a world that could now seek to contain it.Opinion by: Markus Bopp, CEO of TAP Protocol.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-04T12:30:08.000Z,"‘Everything is lining up’ — Tokenization is having its breakout moment","Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is evolving from an abstract concept to a practical financial tool as institutional players increasingly test and deploy blockchain-based infrastructure at scale.This past week alone saw a flurry of announcements from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms advancing their RWA initiatives.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a digital ledger technology shares class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund. It will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors.The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY).On the same day, Libre announced plans to tokenize $500 million in Telegram debt through its new Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). The fund will be available to accredited investors and usable as collateral for onchain borrowing.The week’s biggest headline came from Dubai, where MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA tokenization deal with United Arab Emirates-based real estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk. The deal is touted as the largest RWA tokenization initiative to date.Source: MultiBank“The recent surge isn’t arbitrary. It’s happening because everything’s lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph:“Rules are getting clearer in major markets. The tech is stronger, faster, and ready to scale. And big players are actually doing it — BlackRock is tokenizing funds, Citi is exploring digital asset custody, and Franklin Templeton has tokenized money market funds on public blockchains.”Related: Real-world asset tokenization: Unlocking a new era of financeTokenization has moved beyond theoryMarcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, said the recent announcements “demonstrate that tokenization has moved beyond theoretical discussions into practical application by market leaders.”He added that the growing adoption by big institutions gives the space more credibility, making others feel more confident to join in and help boost new ideas and investments.Kazmierczak stated that the renewed interest in RWA tokenization is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration and growing regulatory clarity.Trump, who has pledged to “make the US the crypto capital of the world,” has taken a different approach to crypto compared to the Biden administration. That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations.However, the narrative appears to be shifting. Since Trump’s election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.Additionally, the DOJ recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.Source: ALXAside from regulatory clarity, advancements in technological capabilities, especially in wallets, have also played a key role in driving tokenization adoption, Felipe D’Onofrio, chief technology officer at Brickken, said.“In parallel, macroeconomic pressures are pushing institutions to search for efficiency and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets,” he added.Related: New era in mining: How tokenization can transform the salt industryEthereum remains main hub for tokenizationEthereum continues to serve as the primary hub for RWA tokenization, thanks to its mature ecosystem, broad developer support and robust infrastructure.“Ethereum remains by far the most suitable blockchain for large-scale RWA issuance due to its unparalleled security, developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption,” Kazmierczak said.However, he noted that dedicated RWA-specialized ecosystems like Canton Network, Plume, and Ondo Chain are building compelling alternatives with features designed explicitly for compliant asset tokenization.According to data from RWA.xyz, the market value of tokenized US Treasurys currently stands at $6.5 billion. Ethereum accounts for the lion’s share of the market, hosting over $4.9 billion in tokenized Treasurys.Source: RWA.xyzHerwig Koningson, CEO of Security Token Market, said companies like BlackRock have shown that it’s possible to build large-scale tokenized products, worth billions of dollars, using more than one blockchain at the same time.He said this shows that the success of tokenizing assets doesn’t depend so much on which blockchain is used, but rather on what the company needs the system to do.“This is why you will see many banks and traditional firms use permissioned blockchains or even private DLT systems,” Koningson said.Related: $21B tokenized RWA market doubtful, institutions uninterested — Plume CEOChallenges remain, but growth potential is hugeYet hurdles remain. Regulation continues to be a significant barrier, especially for risk-averse institutions requiring guarantees around compliance and privacy.Technical limitations also persist, chiefly the lack of interoperability between blockchain platforms, according to Piscini. However, he said hybrid models are gaining traction by offering the privacy of permissioned systems with optional future interoperability with public chains.Looking ahead, Piscini estimated that more than 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. D’Onofrio also made a modest projection, estimating that between 5% and 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by 2030.On the other hand, RedStone’s Kazmierczak predicted that approximately 30% of the global financial system will be tokenized by the end of this decade.In terms of numbers, STM.co predicted that the world’s RWA market will be anywhere between $30 and $50 trillion by the end of 2030.Most firms predict that the RWA sector will reach a market size of between $4 trillion and $30 trillion by 2030.If the sector were to achieve the median prediction of about $10 trillion, it would represent more than 50 times the growth from its current value of around $185 billion, including the stablecoin market, according to a Tren Finance research report.Magazine: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-breakout-moment-blackrock-multibank-telegram?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: TradingViewThe current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse. As of 2025, the pair is down over 80% from its 2021 peak, weighed by skepticism over Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake (PoS), rising competition, and Bitcoin’s growing dominance as an institutional asset.In response to the growing concerns, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed new architecture and protocol-wide standards to make Ethereum simpler, faster, and as maintainable as Bitcoin within five years. Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standardsOne analyst called Buterin’s proposal “the most bullish thing for ETH.”The bullish hopes come as ETH/BTC attempts to break free from its multi-year “bearish parabola.” This resistance curve has been instrumental in limiting the pair’s upside attempts since December 2021 but showed signs of exhaustion as of May 3.Edit the caption here or remove the text“We might see an end of this bearish parabola,” wrote chartist Jimie.He noted that if the curved resistance holds, ETH/BTC could drop toward 0.016 BTC — the same level where it bottomed in September 2019 before rallying by roughly 450%.Flush ETH and buy Bitcoin, says Adam BackSkeptics like Bitcoin’s proof-of-work pioneer, Adam Back, argue that Buterin is overlooking deeper design flaws while proposing to simplify Ethereum in the coming years. Back criticizes Ethereum’s account-based system, saying it adds unnecessary complexity compared to Bitcoin’s simpler UTXO (unspent transaction output) model. He argues this growing complexity increases technical risks and makes Ethereum harder to scale and secure.Source: X/Adam BackHe also warns that Ethereum’s shift to PoS has concentrated power among insiders by redirecting miner rewards to large tokenholders.“At this point, just flush ETH before it hits zero and buy Bitcoin,” he wrote, suggesting no upgrade can fix what he views as Ethereum’s flawed foundation.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

For example, the electricity cost to produce 1 BTC in Ireland is roughly $321,000, but it costs just over $1,300 to mine 1 BTC in Iran. Electricity is only part of the equation — hardware, labor and maintenance costs also play a crucial role.Recent data from CoinShares and MacroMicro.me paints a challenging yet nuanced picture for Bitcoin miners in the United States.

Maybe not, but many creatives are changing their perspectives and the role blockchain should play in the creator economy. ZORA token launch and airdrop go awryThe ZORA token launched on April 23, and it quickly became a point of controversy among users. To start, Zora did not officially announce that it had gone live until two hours after it was already trading, leading to confusion on social media.Source: ZachXBTThe token’s price quickly fell by over 50% within those roughly two hours, from $0.037 to $0.017, adding to users’ complaints. It has since fallen even further, sitting around $0.013 at the time of writing.ZORA’s tokenomics also became a point of contention. 45% of the supply is reserved for the team and investors, while 25% is for the treasury — leaving 20% for community incentives and just 10% for the user airdrop. This led some to complain that the project was keeping too much for itself.Others disliked its general lack of utility. Zora repeatedly stated that the token “is for fun only and does not entitle its holders to any governance rights or a claim on any equity ownership in Zora or its products.” But the project seemed to respond to this criticism on May 1 by announcing that ZORA would have some additional functionalities within the network.However, many others came to the defense of the project, saying that sharing on the platform has been financially lucrative. Others were simply thankful they received anything at all.Source: WbnnsSinger Vérité, who has racked up hundreds of millions of streams as an independent artist and was an early adopter of Web3 tech, told Cointelegraph that “on a base level, I’m appreciative of being rewarded for participating in something early.”She said that while she doesn’t know the team very well, “I feel like they are genuinely trying to construct new models for valuing digital artifacts and have built an aesthetic and culture around their brand in juxtaposition to what are usually awful crypto vibes.”Source: VéritéNFTs no longer the top of the creator food chain Zora’s token launch was the latest move in a broader shift away from the traditional NFT model for creators, in this case toward embracing the cultural dominance of memecoins. While posts on Zora used to be minted as NFTs, now each post creates an instantly tradeable memecoin, also known as a “content coin.” Creators are given 1% of the supply and earn 50% of the trading and liquidity provider fees.Source: ZoraWhile the move from NFTs to content coins was itself controversial, it represents a shift to a new class of creators, according to Adam Levy, host of the Mint podcast and founder of Blueprint, which helps creators go viral onchain. He told Cointelegraph that the wild success of memecoin launchpad Pump.fun “brought in a brand new class of creators that now Zora is trying to capitalize on.”I think the Pump.fun or coin-like model is a perfect token model for a new class of creators that are emerging just generally on the internet. I think it’s like the Gen Z brain rot type of creator that spends a lot of their time remixing content or trying to create viral content in terms of like memetic content.NFT sales remain way down compared to their 2021 peak, and many creators have simply left the NFT space due to its perceived shortcomings. Music-related NFTs, which used to be prevalent on platforms like Zora, have taken a particularly hard beating.Several builders of the most popular creator platforms have moved on to work on other projects. For instance, the team behind music NFT platform Sound.xyz has shifted its focus to a new platform called Vault, which still uses blockchain technology but keeps it hidden on the back end.In a February X post, Sound co-founder David Greenstein said a hyperfocus on speculation led to the decline in NFT interest. “Over time, it became less about the artist, the music, and real connection—and more about financial transactions,” he wrote. “When speculation cooled, so did the energy behind supporting artists.”This sentiment was echoed by Vérité, who said, “I don’t think digital artifacts will have lasting value outside of speculation, experience and patronage.”Related: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor SwiftAccording to music artist and builder Latashá, “We weren’t getting focused on culture; we were getting focused on speculation. And once the bear market hit, it really showcased that.” Latashá, who was previously head of community at Zora and is now building several blockchain-based platforms, told Cointelegraph that people also got too caught up in the language of Web3 instead of simply using the technology:The language and the jargon and even the communities that created that really kind of boxed themselves in when they only stay in that place, right? And so, I always knew that the language was going to change and that the crypto was going to become just the tool, as it should be.What’s next for the onchain creator economy?Despite the shift of interest away from NFTs toward things like memecoins, as encapsulated by Zora, many builders and creators still believe blockchain remains incredibly powerful — just that maybe it needs to be used in a different way.“I learned that you can’t force your idealism onto the world and into the market,” said Vérité. “I am less interested in making ‘Web3 tools’ work because they’re on the blockchain and more interested in finding new ways to solve problems that face artists, audiences and the systems that connect them, regardless of form.”“I definitely won’t sell NFTs to fans,” she added.Levy, on the other hand, remains firm in his belief in NFTs, specifically. “I still have endless conviction in what I’m doing,” he said. He pointed out that cryptocurrency overall, let alone NFTs, is still in the very early stages of adoption. “I think we all need to zoom out.”I don’t think it’s just a fad. I don’t think that this is going to disappear. And I don’t think that because I’ve tasted the sugar of what this is as a creator. [...] And I know there’s a better way to create content on the internet and to monetize on the internet.One notable shift has been to hide the blockchain elements and focus solely on user experience. For example, rap duo Run The Jewels has a fan club where members are rewarded with “JWL” points that can be used to unlock exclusive experiences. JWL is actually an onchain token, but that fact is buried in the club’s FAQ page. “We still need to come up with a better way of making crypto wallets accessible to people so that it is easier,” Renata Lowenbraun, CEO of independent music Web3 platform Infanity, told Cointelegraph. “The moment that happens, everything will change.”Lowenbraun compared blockchain to the internet, saying the internet took decades to truly catch on. NFTs, she argued, had a “false start” before the infrastructure had a chance to mature, “but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to stick and it’s not going to be around and it’s not going to have these amazing applications, particularly for creative people and creative ventures.”For Latashá, the future is in the hands of the artists themselves. “I think artists are just going to build their platforms. I think that’s going to be the future,” she said.From 2021 to 2024, we were really dependent on platforms. [...] And then we witnessed platforms kind of move like Web2 platforms, where they had so much ownership over our worlds and how we move that I think we finally all learned like, ‘Oh yeah, if this is really about building something different, it’s going to have to come from us.’Whatever the future of the Web3 creator economy holds, it’s clear that it won’t be without road bumps along the way. But if the builders and artists are to be believed, the road bumps lie on the path toward greater artist independence.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/zora-airdrop-whats-next-web3-creator-economy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3FREFRESH1635508618602&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Others were simply thankful they received anything at all.Source: WbnnsSinger Vérité, who has racked up hundreds of millions of streams as an independent artist and was an early adopter of Web3 tech, told Cointelegraph that “on a base level, I’m appreciative of being rewarded for participating in something early.”She said that while she doesn’t know the team very well, “I feel like they are genuinely trying to construct new models for valuing digital artifacts and have built an aesthetic and culture around their brand in juxtaposition to what are usually awful crypto vibes.”Source: VéritéNFTs no longer the top of the creator food chain Zora’s token launch was the latest move in a broader shift away from the traditional NFT model for creators, in this case toward embracing the cultural dominance of memecoins. While posts on Zora used to be minted as NFTs, now each post creates an instantly tradeable memecoin, also known as a “content coin.” Creators are given 1% of the supply and earn 50% of the trading and liquidity provider fees.Source: ZoraWhile the move from NFTs to content coins was itself controversial, it represents a shift to a new class of creators, according to Adam Levy, host of the Mint podcast and founder of Blueprint, which helps creators go viral onchain. He told Cointelegraph that the wild success of memecoin launchpad Pump.fun “brought in a brand new class of creators that now Zora is trying to capitalize on.”I think the Pump.fun or coin-like model is a perfect token model for a new class of creators that are emerging just generally on the internet. I think it’s like the Gen Z brain rot type of creator that spends a lot of their time remixing content or trying to create viral content in terms of like memetic content.NFT sales remain way down compared to their 2021 peak, and many creators have simply left the NFT space due to its perceived shortcomings. Music-related NFTs, which used to be prevalent on platforms like Zora, have taken a particularly hard beating.Several builders of the most popular creator platforms have moved on to work on other projects. For instance, the team behind music NFT platform Sound.xyz has shifted its focus to a new platform called Vault, which still uses blockchain technology but keeps it hidden on the back end.In a February X post, Sound co-founder David Greenstein said a hyperfocus on speculation led to the decline in NFT interest. “Over time, it became less about the artist, the music, and real connection—and more about financial transactions,” he wrote. “When speculation cooled, so did the energy behind supporting artists.”This sentiment was echoed by Vérité, who said, “I don’t think digital artifacts will have lasting value outside of speculation, experience and patronage.”Related: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor SwiftAccording to music artist and builder Latashá, “We weren’t getting focused on culture; we were getting focused on speculation. And once the bear market hit, it really showcased that.” Latashá, who was previously head of community at Zora and is now building several blockchain-based platforms, told Cointelegraph that people also got too caught up in the language of Web3 instead of simply using the technology:The language and the jargon and even the communities that created that really kind of boxed themselves in when they only stay in that place, right? And so, I always knew that the language was going to change and that the crypto was going to become just the tool, as it should be.What’s next for the onchain creator economy?Despite the shift of interest away from NFTs toward things like memecoins, as encapsulated by Zora, many builders and creators still believe blockchain remains incredibly powerful — just that maybe it needs to be used in a different way.“I learned that you can’t force your idealism onto the world and into the market,” said Vérité. “I am less interested in making ‘Web3 tools’ work because they’re on the blockchain and more interested in finding new ways to solve problems that face artists, audiences and the systems that connect them, regardless of form.”“I definitely won’t sell NFTs to fans,” she added.Levy, on the other hand, remains firm in his belief in NFTs, specifically. “I still have endless conviction in what I’m doing,” he said. He pointed out that cryptocurrency overall, let alone NFTs, is still in the very early stages of adoption. “I think we all need to zoom out.”I don’t think it’s just a fad. I don’t think that this is going to disappear. And I don’t think that because I’ve tasted the sugar of what this is as a creator. [...] And I know there’s a better way to create content on the internet and to monetize on the internet.One notable shift has been to hide the blockchain elements and focus solely on user experience. For example, rap duo Run The Jewels has a fan club where members are rewarded with “JWL” points that can be used to unlock exclusive experiences. JWL is actually an onchain token, but that fact is buried in the club’s FAQ page. “We still need to come up with a better way of making crypto wallets accessible to people so that it is easier,” Renata Lowenbraun, CEO of independent music Web3 platform Infanity, told Cointelegraph. “The moment that happens, everything will change.”Lowenbraun compared blockchain to the internet, saying the internet took decades to truly catch on. NFTs, she argued, had a “false start” before the infrastructure had a chance to mature, “but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to stick and it’s not going to be around and it’s not going to have these amazing applications, particularly for creative people and creative ventures.”For Latashá, the future is in the hands of the artists themselves. “I think artists are just going to build their platforms. I think that’s going to be the future,” she said.From 2021 to 2024, we were really dependent on platforms. [...] And then we witnessed platforms kind of move like Web2 platforms, where they had so much ownership over our worlds and how we move that I think we finally all learned like, ‘Oh yeah, if this is really about building something different, it’s going to have to come from us.’Whatever the future of the Web3 creator economy holds, it’s clear that it won’t be without road bumps along the way. But if the builders and artists are to be believed, the road bumps lie on the path toward greater artist independence.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/zora-airdrop-whats-next-web3-creator-economy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-03T13:15:00.000Z,"What is a sealed-bid token launch?","What are the various methods for launching crypto tokens?              Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how tokens are brought to the market.The sealed-bid token launch is a growing trend in this crypto fundraising landscape. Unlike public presales or airdrops, where participants see pricing or allocation terms in advance, sealed-bid models keep each bid confidential until the process ends. This approach is increasingly favored for enabling better price discovery, limiting front-running and curbing manipulation, especially for in-demand tokens.Did you know? Sealed-bid auctions are a crypto twist on traditional finance. They have been used for government bond sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). Now they are redefining token launches by hiding bidder-related information and transparency.                  Sealed-bid token launch, explained              A sealed-bid token launch is a method of distributing cryptocurrency tokens where participants submit private bids without knowing what others are offering. This approach, derived from traditional sealed-bid auctions, involves participants offering secret bids, and the highest bidder typically wins. Auction systems, such as sealed-bid launches, are increasingly built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, using privacy-enhancing technologies such as Zama’s fhEVM (fully homomorphic Ethereum Virtual Machine) to ensure confidentiality and fairness. Unlike open auctions, where public visibility can escalate prices through bidding wars, sealed-bid formats prevent strategic bidding based on competitors’ actions. In crypto, a sealed-bid token launch leads to fair and transparent token allocation, minimizing price manipulation and front-running. Systems enforce a single bid per participant by leveraging cryptographic techniques like commitments and smart contract logic to prevent multiple bids and enforce payment obligations. Each participant specifies desired token quantities and prices. After the bidding window closes, bids are revealed and assessed using predefined rules, like clearing prices or allocation tiers. This method often reduces bot interference and promotes equitable access during high-demand launches.A key feature of a sealed-bid token launch is its “one-shot” bidding process. Bidders cannot revise their offers or view others’ bids beforehand, which sets up a level playing field. However, it also brings in strategic uncertainty, as participants must estimate optimal bids without cues about other bids. In April 2024, Conor McGregor fundraised for his memecoin REAL using a sealed-bid launch. The mixed martial arts icon introduced the fundraising through a sealed-bid token auction to prevent bots and snipers from manipulating the sale. The project hoped to promote transparency and integrity in a space often plagued by front-running and rug pulls.While the project didn’t disclose token lock-up details, the sealed-bid format and focus on long-term engagement suggest a strategic attempt to execute a transparent and more community-driven launch.                  How do sealed-bid token launches work?              Sealed-bid token launches follow a structured process that minimizes the chances of manipulation and ensures transparency. Here is how the process usually unfolds:Step 1 (Project announcement): The crypto project typically announces the sealed-bid token sale through its official website, social media channels like X, or platforms like Binance Launchpad. It outlines details such as the number of tokens available, bidding timeline, minimum and maximum bid limits, and the process of token allocation.Step 2 (Private bid submission): Participants submit bids to an auctioneer on the platform by providing secret bids before a deadline. Each bid includes the desired token quantity and the offered price. Participants cannot view other bids, ensuring privacy and reducing strategic manipulation.Step 3 (Bid locking): Once submitted, all bids are locked. This prevents users from changing or withdrawing their bids, reinforcing transparency.Step 4 (Token allocation): Post deadline, the smart contract processes all bids. Tokens are distributed either to the highest bidders or through a pricing model like a clearing price or a tiered allocation. Lower bids may receive a partial allocation or a refund.In McGregor’s fundraising, participants submitted private bids in USDC (USDC) during a limited 28-hour window without knowing what others were offering. Once the auction closed, bids were ranked, and tokens were allocated to the highest bidders until the supply ran out. Such auction systems function on a smart contract that ranks all offers, calculates the cutoff price, and allocates tokens to qualifying bidders. Excess funds are refunded automatically. This onchain process eliminates the need for intermediaries, offering immutability and trustless execution.                  Advantages of sealed-bid token launches              Sealed-bid token launches offer an alternative to other models of token sales. This format has gained popularity in crypto, thanks to its potential to create more balanced token distribution and pricing.Transparency: While individual bids remain hidden during the process, all bids and allocations are revealed after the deadline via smart contracts. This ensures onchain verifiability and trust.Reduces gas wars and front-running: Unlike first-come-first-served launches where users race to submit transactions, sealed bids are submitted over a set period. It reduces congestion and the risk of bots exploiting faster access.Encourages fairer price discovery: Since bids are placed without seeing other offers, participants bid based on perceived token value. This mechanism leads to a more organic price that reflects market demand rather than hype or manipulation.Minimizes whale dominance: Sealed bids make it harder for large players to take tokens by simply outbidding small participants in real-time. Prevents manipulation: By removing live price visibility, sealed-bid launches reduce the chances of orchestrated pump-and-dump behavior. It discourages collusion of bidders or biased decisions on the part of the project.Did you know? Sealed-bid launches may evolve with decentralized identity tools. A world might emerge where only verified wallets can bid — combining privacy, fairness and compliance in one go.                  Risks and limitations of sealed-bid tokens              Although sealed-bid token launches introduce a range of benefits, they also entail various risks and compromises. These issues can affect both project teams and participants:Opacity at the initial stage: Since bids remain confidential until the sale concludes, some users might feel lost, unaware of what other people are bidding.Complexity: Sealed-bid auctions can be complex and less transparent to average investors. This complexity may deter participation, especially from those unfamiliar with such mechanisms.Less suitable for small-cap projects: Small-cap projects generally lack an established community. Moreover, small-cap projects rely on viral marketing and word-of-mouth to gain traction, but the closed environment of sealed-bid auctions can dampen momentum.Blockchain-specific risks: As the whole process is executed onchain by a smart contract, blockchain-specific risks such as malfunctioning code and an attacker breaching the network are always present.Risk of underfunding: If the project doesn’t attract enough competitive bids, which is common with lesser-known tokens, it may fall short of funding goals. McGregor’s REAL could raise only 39% of its target.The REAL memecoin, backed by McGregor and launched through a sealed-bid auction, failed to meet its fundraising target, securing only $392,315 — approximately 39% of its $1.008 million goal. Several external factors played a significant role in this outcome. Several external factors contributed significantly to this outcome. Chief among them was the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which coincided with the token’s launch and led to a generally risk-averse investment environment. This was compounded by growing skepticism toward memecoins, as investors became increasingly wary following a series of high-profile scams and failed projects in the space. The celebrity endorsement, while attention-grabbing, may have also backfired — many investors viewed McGregor’s involvement as superficial and questioned the project’s long-term credibility. Additionally, the token’s design raised red flags, particularly its 12-hour unlock window, which resembled patterns seen in pump-and-dump schemes. A lack of transparent communication and insufficient community engagement further weakened investor confidence. While the sealed-bid auction format is designed to ensure fairness and reduce manipulation, its complexity may have posed a barrier to broader participation, particularly among retail investors unfamiliar with the mechanism.                  Use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto and future potential              Sealed-bid token launches offer a unique approach to fair token distribution. These launches are gaining attention as an alternative to traditional public sales or airdrops. Their design ensures privacy and minimizes manipulation during high-demand token sales.Here are some prominent use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto that reflect their future potential:DAO fundraising and decentralized launchpads: Sealed bids can enhance transparency in fundraising campaigns by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), thus boosting their credibility. The sealed-bid format reduces front-running and increases trust. Future decentralized launchpads may adopt similar systems to build credibility and avoid hype-driven token launches.KYC and identity integration: As compliance becomes more critical, sealed-bid systems could integrate with Know Your Customer (KYC) or digital identity verification layers. This would allow only verified participants to bid, reducing Sybil attacks and increasing regulatory confidence. Such integration could attract institutional investors and expand access to compliant, fair token sales.Effective for scarce supply tokens: Sealed-bid auctions are most effective when distributing tokens with limited supply. By hiding bid amounts until the auction ends, this method encourages genuine price discovery and prevents bots or whales from dominating the sale.As the crypto space matures, sealed-bid launches may become a standard for transparent and inclusive fundraising.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-sealed-bid-token-launch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3FREFRESH1635508618602&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: DeribitReport: Deribit options exchange is evaluating buyout offers: ReportCrypto firms target US expansionDeribit joins a growing list of European and Asian crypto firms exploring US expansion.The shift comes after a period of regulatory hostility during the Biden administration, following the collapse of FTX in late 2022.That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the SEC and DOJ, prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations. However, the narrative appears to be shifting under Trump, who has pledged to “make the US the crypto capital of the world.”Since Trump’s election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.Additionally, the Department of Justice recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.Related: Tether CEO to take ‘cautious’ approach to US expansion, eyes larger profitsThis hands-on approach appears to be boosting industry confidence.OKX, for example, has announced plans to establish a US headquarters in San Jose, California, just months after settling a $504 million case with US authorities.On April 28, Nexo, which left the US at the end of 2022 citing a lack of regulatory clarity, revealed that it is reentering the US market.Switzerland’s Wintermute and Dubai’s DWF Labs are among other major crypto players that have shown interest in exploring US expansion.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/deribit-us-expansion-trump-crypto-regulation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

For Mike Anderson, core contributor at THINK, the Think Agent Standard is the future of AI.Anderson and his team developed the Think Agent Standard to enable millions of autonomous onchain AI agents to transact and communicate. The protocol now has over 70 companies, like Arbitrum and Yuga Labs, on board to help out. The platform is now live, allowing developers, enterprises and Web3 communities to experiment with the framework.“There was always this idea that it’s so much harder to [build AI] and so much more expensive when you have to build a thousand custom ways of doing it,” Anderson said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “By standardizing demand — the way people want to receive AI — you can get the whole market to line up because they want customers, and getting customers in AI is really difficult.”Following the release of Meta’s Llama 2 a few years ago, Anderson and his team decided that if the future of decentralized AI ever manifested, they needed to ensure that consumers could easily use graphic processing units (GPUs) without spending billions of dollars.“We watched as this whole ecosystem started to grow, with people saying, ’I’m going to build this part of the stack,’ and others saying they’ll ‘build that part of the stack,” almost as if Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed up with each department, with one saying they’ll do the data and another saying they’ll do the networking,” Anderson said.We found that the problem isn’t having enough builders, it’s aligning them around an actual use case.Mike Anderson, core contributor at THINK.

The use case brought nine different companies to work together for an audience of 30,000 viewers last summer.That validated the idea that we could unite all of these infrastructure companies, provide a better product to customers, and do it in a way where users owned their information, data, keys, and encryption.Because if owning and controlling AI agents is to remain in the hands of users, the decentralized AI agent platforms need to be simple, user-intuitive, well-designed and deliver on a user experience that could have changed the way we use and understand social media.Related: How Meta’s antitrust case could dampen AI development“Imagine if we’d had the foresight in 2003 to see social media as a way to organize our lives,” Anderson said. “Instead of having accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, what if we had a standard where your accounts follow you—where all of your data and everything you’d posted in the past is something you’re providing to them. It’s a very different thing if users owned their accounts and data and could have opted into seeing ads where they would benefit from them. That’s what we’re building.”The future of AI agentsJust as the ERC-20 standard enabled the tokenized economy, the Think Agent Standard introduces a modular, permissionless and composable system that allows AI agents to function as sovereign digital entities: Owning wallets, interacting with smart contracts and transacting seamlessly across every blockchain.Each Think agent is powered by Non-Fungible Intelligence™ (NFI), a digital identity layer that establishes ownership, memory, and authentication, with the core genome palette residing on The Root Network and subsequent layers deployed to any connected network natively. The agents are composed of three core elements: The Soul (NFI), which provides a persistent, self-sovereign identity; the Mind, which governs behavior and decision-making; and the Body, which allows interaction across platforms and environments.The first platform built on the Think Agent Standard is SOULS, a personal AI agent that users can own, train and customize. SOULS connects to thousands of open-source applications and evolves over time by integrating the best available intelligence without compromising user privacy or ownership.Related: Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in SwitzerlandLeading organizations in gaming, infrastructure and generative AI, including Yuga Labs, Futureverse, Alchemy, Render, Venice.ai and Magic Eden, are actively integrating the standard into real-world applications, further validating its potential across use cases.“AI agents are the new interface to technology,” Anderson said. “What we’ve been able to do successfully is partner with consumer brands — like Bored Ape Yacht Club — to actually have distribution into a consumer’s end point, and we’ve been able to build all the systems so that they can actually access consumers.”We’re helping people transition to the AI age by owning their intelligence instead of renting it from someone else.For Anderson, a personal AI agent is like a personal dashboard that acts as an extension of your real self. If the information contained within your AI agent were to leak, the results could be personally catastrophic. That’s why Think is standardizing the system the agent can interact with, backed by cryptography, no matter what chain the agent is on. If a safe and successful standard exists within the user-owned AI agent industry, big tech will have a harder time controlling it.It’s why users can own their data through their Think agent, eliminating the need for their data to be copied and live on some external third-party server. In this way, Think agents also hope to address the issue around data ownership by putting users in control of who they share their information with.“When a social company goes out of business, all of that data gets sold to the highest bidder,” Anderson said. “23andMe is the most egregious example of this.

2025-05-02T22:20:00.000Z,"Pro-crypto senator pushes back on Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner — Report","Senator Cynthia Lummis and at least one other Republican in Congress are reportedly critical of US President Donald Trump for offering the top holders of his memecoin a dinner and White House tour. According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve.Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projectsThe launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.”Calls for impeachment over ties to cryptoGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump. Usernames from the TRUMP leaderboard have led to speculation that staunch supporters like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the attendees. As of May 2, neither the individuals nor the companies have made any formal announcements.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senator-cynthia-lummis-critical-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3FREFRESH1635508618602&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
