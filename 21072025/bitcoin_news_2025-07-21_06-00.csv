2025-07-21T03:47:44,"Coinbase: Sell Crypto Legislation (GENIUS Act) Hype","Summary COIN's current valuation is excessive given its stagnant market share and fierce competition from both crypto and traditional financial institutions. Despite pro-crypto legislation and industry buzz, Coinbase's fundamentals and revenue growth have lagged, failing to surpass previous cycle highs. COIN's market cap now exceeds established exchanges like CME and ICE, which is unjustified given its limited economic utility compared to those platforms. I recommend selling or avoiding COIN at current levels; the risk/reward is unfavorable at these prices. I was a very vocal bull on Coinbase(COIN) during the crypto winter in 2022 (link here ) when it had a market cap of $15 billion and crypto exchanges/products were dropping like flies(link here ). I argued that at those valuations, COIN had a very good chance of doing well, due to its strong creditworthiness. COIN was trading at ~$60/share then and is $419/share now. But at its current market cap and with all this market buzz about pro-crypto legislation, I think the risks outweigh the value and potential. COIN stock price (stockcharts) 1.COIN operates in a very competitive market COIN operates in a very competitive market with existing competitors such as Binance. There‚Äôs not much inherent advantage you get from trading on COIN that you can‚Äôt get from trading at say IBKR or BTC ETFs. By one measure (per below chart , COIN‚Äôs market share was 6% in July 2025, virtually unchanged compared to 2022). Crypto trading market share is difficult to measure (and by some measurements, COIN‚Äôs market share is much higher), but the financial figures in the sections below seems to suggest that COIN probably hasn‚Äôt made much progress in terms of market share. Coinbase market share (The Block) The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , while ostensibly favorable for the crypto industry, does not have a clear mechanism to benefit COIN. Unlike 5 years ago when mainstream financial institutions were less flattering in their view of crypto, nowadays many mainstream financial institutions are seriously trying to figure out how to capitalize on this market segment. Even if there is major growth from stablecoins, there will likely be lots of competing options and JPM and Blackrock can probably offer as compelling (if not even more compelling) product given their size and stature. With the huge success of Bitcoin ETFs in terms of capital attracted , this will likely attract more competition from mainstream financial institutions. 2.COIN has market cap on par or even higher than many traditional exchanges. Market cap at July 18 2025 (CME ) $99bn ( ICE ) $103bn ( COIN ) $107bn When I made the above comparison in 2022, COIN had a market cap that was a fraction of traditional exchanges such as CME and ICE. Now COIN‚Äôs market cap surpasses that of CME and ICE. If we take a step back, does that really make sense from an economic perspective? Is the value of a crypto exchange going to exceed that of exchanges that trade hundreds of products from oil to food that we need on a day to day basis? Or to put it another way, people and companies will be buying and selling futures on CME or ICE to hedge their exposure to foods, metals etc and they‚Äôre probably happy to let CME and ICE take a small cut out of that, in order to conduct this activity on a well-established exchange. Whereas crypto traders are mainly trading back and forth the existing pile of Bitcoin etc, while there is some value in this, I can‚Äôt see in the long run, how such a crypto exchange would be able to extract more value out of this activity, than exchanges such as CME and ICE that can out of hundreds of commodities and derivatives. While crypto may have its uses, you can‚Äôt eat Bitcoin, or make cars out of it etc - CME and ICE are essentially ‚Äútaxing‚Äù or taking a small cut out of trillions of dollars of recurring economic activity whereas COIN is making money off people largely trading a few types of securities. I just don‚Äôt see COIN as being proportional to CME and ICE in the long run. 3.COIN fundamentals have not shown much growth While COIN revenues have grown substantially since my bullish piece in 2022, overall the growth has been rather slower than I anticipated: Revenues have only grown to $6.7 bn on a TTM basis , compared to $3 billion in 2022 and have not even exceeded the previous cycle‚Äôs highs (2021 revenues of $7.8bn. Profitability is also nowhere near previous cycle‚Äôs highs either, TTM net income is $1.5bn possibly impact by one-off items as 2024 net income was $2.5bn, but in any case, still lower than 2021 net income of $3.1 bn. I think this further shows how competitive the crypto landscape is, despite favorable policy environment and strong creditworthiness, COIN has not been able to capitalize on the trend and achieve meaningful growth in the past few years. Risks to bearish thesis With the passage of pro-crypto legislation, perhaps COIN can capitalize on this wave of interest and achieve further growth to sustain its market cap. It‚Äôs possible, but I just don‚Äôt see it as very likely. Conclusion: I think COIN is probably a sell at these prices, or at the very least, definitely not a buy. The best times to buy crypto in the past few years (and also stocks) were when the sky seemed to be falling and markets were panicking over this or that, not when there‚Äôs glowing media attention and eye-boggling valuations. Again, I would not recommend shorting, with all this favorable coverage of crypto, who knows how long this train will run and I don‚Äôt view the risks from shorting as worth it, but I do not view COIN as providing good potential reward for the risks at these prices.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802557-coinbase-sell-crypto-legislation-genius-act-hype?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC","COIN",cryptocompare

2025-07-21T03:22:56,"XRP Price Prediction For July 21","The post XRP Price Prediction For July 21 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently showing strong bullish signs, especially on the weekly chart. While there is a bearish divergence forming, it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet and for now, the overall trend for XRP remains bullish, and the price structure still supports a breakout outlook. XRP is known for its sharp, fast price movements. Right now, it seems to be in the middle of a move to the upside, just like the previous volatile cycles. The recent breakout above the important $3 resistance level is a strong signal that the asset could be heading toward new all-time highs. If the trend continues, the next big price target lies between $4.60 and $4.70, based on the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. However, if XRP does pull back, there‚Äôs strong support at the $3 level and even stronger short-term support between $3.30 and $3.40, an area that previously acted as resistance but is now turning into a solid base after the recent breakout and retest. On the daily chart, XRP has already confirmed this new support zone after bouncing off it recently. This is a positive shift that shows bulls are still in control. The altcoin‚Äôs strength is also supported by the declining Bitcoin dominance in the market. As Bitcoin loses some ground in terms of market share, capital is flowing into altcoins like XRP and Ethereum, giving them room to grow and outperform. Conclusion: Right now, XRP‚Äôs price is moving just as expected in a bullish pattern. It recently broke above $3.40 and is now consolidating, or stabilizing, just above that line. As long as it stays above this level, the trend looks strong. However, there are important support levels to watch. If XRP falls below $2.75, the overall uptrend could break down, which would be a warning sign.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-21/,"TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-21T03:03:47,"Why Bitcoin Is Missing Out on Today‚Äôs Crypto Rally","The post Why Bitcoin Is Missing Out on Today‚Äôs Crypto Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin remains stuck below a key resistance level, much of the crypto market, especially altcoins like Ethereum and XRP, is showing strong bullish signs. So, why is the broader crypto market pumping while Bitcoin is cooling off? The answer lies in Bitcoin dominance, which is seeing a sharp drop. Bitcoin dominance refers to how much of the total crypto market value is held in Bitcoin. When this dominance falls, it usually means that investors are moving money from Bitcoin into altcoins. This shift is a sign that ‚Äúaltcoin season‚Äù has begun, where assets like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP often outperform Bitcoin. In fact, Ethereum has surged by nearly 3.75% recently, even as Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the market dropped by about 0.62%. The total value of the altcoin market is still below its all-time high, which shows there‚Äôs space for further growth. Also, the total crypto market cap, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing a bullish pattern similar to what the market saw in 2017 before altcoins exploded in price. What About Bitcoin? Still Bullish, But Facing Short-Term Resistance In every past cycle, Bitcoin is usually the first to move. Once it makes a strong rally, the next big move comes from Ethereum. After that, large altcoins begin to rise, followed by smaller and newer altcoins. This pattern has repeated itself over the years, and so far, the current market seems to be following the same path. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs overall long-term trend remains bullish , with a cup-and-handle pattern hinting at a move toward $153,000. However, in the short term, it‚Äôs facing tough resistance between $120,000 and $123,000. Until BTC breaks above that zone, it may continue trading sideways. Short-term indicators like the RSI (Relative Strength Index) show that Bitcoin has cooled down from its overbought levels, which means there‚Äôs room for a fresh move up. But before that happens, Bitcoin might dip slightly to around $116,700, where there‚Äôs a lot of market liquidity, before possibly heading higher again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-missing-out-on-todays-crypto-rally/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ETH","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-21T03:00:16,"Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Breakdown","BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Breakdown The world of cryptocurrency is a whirlwind of innovation, opportunity, and sometimes, intense volatility. For those navigating the derivatives market, understanding the mechanics of crypto perpetual futures liquidation is not just important; it‚Äôs essential for survival. In the last 24 hours, the market witnessed significant liquidation events across major digital assets, painting a vivid picture of prevailing market sentiment and trader positioning. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what these figures mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before we dissect the numbers, let‚Äôs clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidation entails. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, mimicking spot market trading with leverage. This leverage, while amplifying potential gains, also magnifies losses. Liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, leading the exchange to automatically close their leveraged position to prevent further losses. It‚Äôs a critical mechanism designed to protect both the exchange and the solvency of the market. Leverage Amplifies: While leverage can magnify potential gains, it equally magnifies potential losses, making risk management paramount. Margin Call Trigger: Liquidation is triggered when a trader‚Äôs margin balance on a leveraged position drops below the minimum maintenance level required by the exchange. Automatic Closure: The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent the trader‚Äôs account from falling into negative equity and to maintain market stability. Market Protection: This mechanism helps protect both individual traders from excessive debt and the overall market from systemic risk due to highly leveraged, failing positions. The Shocking 24-Hour Breakdown: Who Got Hit Hardest by Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? The past 24 hours have been particularly telling, with substantial amounts of capital wiped out due to crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This data provides a snapshot of where the market‚Äôs vulnerabilities lie and which positions were most aggressively pursued, only to be unwound. Let‚Äôs look at the raw numbers: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation (USD) Dominant Position Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $41.50 million Long (58.09%) Ethereum (ETH) $150.27 million Short (65.73%) Dogecoin (DOGE) $19.94 million Long (50.44%) Deep Dive: What Do These Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Numbers Tell Us? Bitcoin (BTC): Longs Wiped Out With $41.50 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , Bitcoin saw a majority of long positions (58.09%) liquidated. This suggests that during the 24-hour period, BTC experienced a price drop, catching bullish traders off guard. Long positions profit from price increases, so a significant liquidation of longs indicates downward price pressure. This often happens during sudden market dips or corrections, forcing traders who bet on higher prices to exit their positions at a loss. It‚Äôs a classic example of how swift market movements can punish overleveraged bullish bets. Ethereum (ETH): A Short Squeeze in Reverse? Ethereum stood out with a staggering $150.27 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , predominantly from short positions (65.73%). This is a crucial insight: a high liquidation of short positions typically occurs when the asset‚Äôs price unexpectedly rises, forcing bearish traders to cover their positions. This suggests a significant upward price movement for ETH during the period, challenging the bearish sentiment that had accumulated. Such events can trigger cascade effects, as forced short closures can further fuel price increases, creating what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô that catches bears off guard. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin Volatility Strikes Longs Dogecoin, true to its volatile nature, saw $19.94 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , with long positions accounting for 50.44%. Similar to Bitcoin, this indicates a price decline that hit traders betting on DOGE‚Äôs upward momentum. Meme coins like DOGE are particularly susceptible to rapid price swings due to their community-driven nature and speculative appeal. These liquidation figures underscore the heightened risk associated with leveraged trading on such assets, where even minor market shifts can have outsized impacts on positions. The Ripple Effect: Why Does Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Matter to the Market? Understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation is not just about tracking losses; it‚Äôs about grasping market dynamics. These events have several profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and individual traders: Increased Volatility: Large-scale liquidations can create cascading effects. Forced selling (in long liquidations) or forced buying (in short liquidations) further pushes prices in the direction of the initial move, leading to more liquidations. This feedback loop can amplify market movements, making prices more volatile. Market Sentiment Indicator: The dominant direction of liquidations (whether more longs or shorts were liquidated) offers a strong signal about prevailing market sentiment and where traders were positioned incorrectly. It can reveal areas of over-leveraged bullish or bearish bets. Risk Management Lessons: For individual traders, these figures serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks of excessive leverage. They highlight the critical importance of robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes to avoid devastating losses. Liquidity Impact: While painful for those liquidated, these events are a necessary part of the market‚Äôs self-correction mechanism. They help to clear out overleveraged positions, which can lead to a healthier, more stable market structure in the long run by removing speculative froth. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Traders in the Face of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Given the ever-present risk of crypto perpetual futures liquidation , what can traders do to protect themselves and potentially capitalize on market shifts? Here are some actionable insights: Master Risk Management: This is paramount. Never over-leverage your positions. Understand your margin requirements thoroughly and always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses automatically. This single practice can save your portfolio from significant downturns. Monitor Funding Rates: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts can indicate overall market sentiment and potential areas of imbalance. High positive funding rates suggest bullish sentiment and long overcrowding, potentially preceding a long squeeze. Conversely, negative rates indicate bearish sentiment and short overcrowding, which could lead to a short squeeze. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, macroeconomic developments, and on-chain data. Sudden news events, regulatory changes, or significant whale movements can trigger rapid price swings that lead to widespread liquidations. Knowledge is your first line of defense. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your capital into a single asset or a single leveraged position. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and trading strategies can help mitigate the impact of adverse movements in a single asset or market segment. Understand Market Structure: Recognize that liquidations are a natural, albeit sometimes brutal, part of a leveraged market. They can create opportunities for those prepared to take counter-positions or re-enter the market at more favorable prices after the initial volatility subsides. Conclusion: A Constant Reminder of Crypto‚Äôs Volatile Dance The 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in the digital asset space. While the figures highlight significant losses for many, they also offer invaluable insights into market dynamics, sentiment shifts, and the critical importance of prudent risk management. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these fundamental mechanisms will remain paramount for both seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation 1. What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs margin balance on a leveraged perpetual futures position falls below the exchange‚Äôs maintenance margin requirement, typically due to adverse price movements against their position. This means the market moved too far in the opposite direction of their trade, and they no longer have sufficient collateral to cover potential losses. 2. How can traders avoid liquidation in perpetual futures? Traders can minimize the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions before they hit liquidation price, monitoring their margin levels closely, and maintaining sufficient collateral (margin) in their accounts to withstand market fluctuations. 3. Does liquidation always mean a loss for the trader? Yes, liquidation results in the automatic closure of a leveraged position at a loss. The exchange liquidates the position to prevent the trader‚Äôs account from going into negative equity, meaning the trader loses their initial margin and potentially more if the market moves too quickly. 4. What is the difference between long and short liquidation? Long liquidation happens when the price of an asset drops significantly, forcing bullish traders (who bet on price increases) to close their positions at a loss. Short liquidation occurs when the price of an asset rises unexpectedly, forcing bearish traders (who bet on price decreases) to close their positions, often at a substantial loss, in what is known as a short squeeze. 5. Are liquidation data reliable indicators of market sentiment? Yes, liquidation data can be a strong indicator of market sentiment and areas of over-leveraged positions. A high volume of long liquidations suggests prevailing bearish pressure or an overly bullish market being corrected. Conversely, high short liquidations suggest bullish pressure or a market that has caught bears by surprise. Found this breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation insightful?

2025-07-21T02:41:50,"BTC at $121K, ETH at $3K, ADA at $0.71, still, one $0.03 token may outperform all","The cryptocurrency market continues to dazzle with Bitcoin (BTC) soaring beyond the $121,000 mark, Ethereum (ETH) holding steady at $3,000, and Cardano (ADA) reaching $0.71. Despite these impressive milestones, prudent investors are turning their attention to a token priced at just $0.03 that is poised to deliver outsized returns in the near future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining momentum and stands out as a compelling opportunity for both seasoned traders and new entrants seeking exceptional growth in DeFi. While BTC, ETH, and ADA dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly advances with a solid presale foundation. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with 80% of the total 4 billion token supply sold during Phase 5. More than 13,600 holders have already committed to MUTM, signaling growing confidence in the project‚Äôs vision. The current presale price of $0.03 will soon increase to $0.035 in the next phase, marking a strategic entry point before a significant price run. Cutting-edge lending models and layer-2 innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch two distinct lending models aimed at addressing the diverse needs of crypto investors: P2C (Pool-to-Contract) lending and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) borrowing. In the proposed P2C model, a user lending $15,000 worth of BTC-backed assets at a 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could potentially earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 12%. Upon depositing, users would receive 15,000mtBTC tokens in 1:1 that reflect their holdings and are designed to increase in value as interest accumulates. This mechanism is intended to offer passive income and liquidity without requiring constant oversight or manual reinvestment. Meanwhile, the planned P2P borrowing model is expected to provide greater flexibility through direct, customizable loan agreements. In this scenario, a borrower might use 2 PEPE tokens as collateral to access $1,200 in USDT at a 70% LTV, with repayment terms negotiated individually. This direct, peer-driven approach is being developed to accommodate users seeking more tailored lending experiences than traditional DeFi platforms typically allow. A foundational aspect of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs future roadmap is its integration with Layer-2 blockchain technology. This strategic move is expected to significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times‚Äîtwo persistent challenges in DeFi. By delivering faster, more affordable transactions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to lower the barrier to entry for a wider audience and improve the overall usability of its protocol. Security, roadmap, and community incentives fuel growth The platform will undergo rigorous audits during its upcoming roadmap phases, including manual reviews and advanced automated analysis. CertiK, a trusted leader in blockchain security, has already provided Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with impressive audit results, including a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. These scores reflect strong code integrity and secure smart contract architecture, reassuring investors that their funds will be protected. The project is gearing up for its Beta launch, which will open the platform to early testers, allowing the community to explore features and provide critical feedback. This phase will showcase the robustness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs smart contracts, front-end and back-end developments, and risk management tools. As this Beta testing phase unfolds, user confidence will grow, setting the stage for a successful mainnet release. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also actively rewarding its growing community. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, serves to expand the user base while building engagement. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivises security researchers worldwide to contribute to the platform‚Äôs resilience, ensuring that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stays ahead of potential vulnerabilities. As the next presale phase approaches, the opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at $0.03 dwindles rapidly. The impending 20% price increase to $0.035 will likely accelerate demand, especially from whales currently reallocating assets from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These large investors recognise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an undervalued DeFi token with a roadmap, technology, and community that position it for explosive growth. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios beyond established giants like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a high-conviction opportunity. With a revolutionary lending system, advanced Layer-2 integration, solid security audits, and strong incentives for early supporters, MUTM is on track to outperform the big three within just 60 days of wider market exposure. The time to act is now. The combination of a low current price, nearly sold-out presale, and upcoming milestones makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rare chance to join a project at the ground floor ‚Äî before it rockets past even the most iconic cryptocurrencies.
