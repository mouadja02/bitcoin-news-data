Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chart Many ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $ 31.31930364 0.67% Market cap $ 623,104,103.3794 Circulating Supply 19,895,209.3750 Trading Volume $ 62,566,086.9638 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86, the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it marked April’s low on day one of entering the second half of the year. But, the broader rally in the first week onwards pushed BSV to break out from its falling wedge pattern, as a result, it has surged more than 35% and still shows its urge to rise more. A look at RSI supports the optimism, as the value of 65 shows that there is ample space available to push higher until the strength exhausts. Therefore, at the current level, odds are significantly higher that if BSV crypto bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark or even $50. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in Q1 2025, and even Q2 saw a decline despite a bullish attempt. As witnessed in the first half of 2025, it totally erased over 70% of its gains. Also, the attempts to rise in Q2 2025 made BSV struggle, which ended up forming another declining wedge. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. However, as July began, the BSV price surged from the pattern’s lower border, which was aligned with April’s swing low support. This happened with renewed broader crypto market optimism and top cryptos like BTC, XRP, and others pushing to newer boundaries. Therefore, this continued optimism in the short term has resulted in a strong breakout from Q2’s correction-based falling wedge pattern and seeks a retest of the 200-day EMA band. Therefore, if BSV bulls regain strength and flip the 200-day EMA band, another extension to the rally could occur. Supporting this optimism, In July, a DA lead within the BSV blockchain engaged the community on X, seeking their thought s on an open-source BSV wallet. When asked about the preferred login method for mobile devices, the majority favored the option of “Phone OTP & Password.” While this post primarily served as a community feedback initiative, it subtly suggests that BSV may be preparing for something significant. The development of the BSV wallet could be an early indication of larger plans on the horizon for the BSV ecosystem. That said, technically if on chart, a decisive move pumps then it could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of July. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could even target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline, then its price may drop toward $24.

2025-07-21T09:56:35,"Top Analyst Says XRP to Hit $10, Citing Bullish XRP-Bitcoin Chart!","The post Top Analyst Says XRP to Hit $10, Citing Bullish XRP-Bitcoin Chart! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple’s native token, could be gearing up for a big jump if Bitcoin’s rally keeps its pace. Well-known crypto analyst Dr Cat says that if Bitcoin manages to reach $144,000 soon, XRP could triple in value, climbing to somewhere between $6 and $10 within the next two months. On top of it XRP’s market cap has surpassed the oil giant Shell, now stands at about $210 billion, while Shell’s value is around $206 billion. XRP/BTC Setup Looks Promising In a recent tweet post Pseudonymous crypto trader Dr. Cat has outlined a bullish scenario where XRP could triple in value within the next two months. According to him, the XRP/BTC pair is currently “coiling” under a crucial resistance level at 2,674 satoshis. If XRP closes this month above that level, it could trigger the first bullish Ichimoku Cloud “kumo twist” since 2018, a rare signal often followed by major upswings. $XRP / $BTC Ripple / Bitcoin – Quick Update The price keeps pushing and LTF is bullish so it's not clear whether the high won't be taken actually as opposed to the local top idea.

However, he emphasizes that the overall trend remains bullish and that XRP could still rally in the near term regardless of this technical detail. XRP Eyes $10 Mark The trader highlights a major resistance zone between 4,135 and 7,600 satoshis, which he calls the “take-profit zone.” According to Dr. Cat, this is the critical area that could define whether XRP continues its upward path or faces heavy selling pressure. If XRP manages to push into this range, Dr Cat says a first stop would be around $4.50, with $6 to $10 possible if Bitcoin keeps its strong trend going. XRP Market Performance Strengthens the Case XRP has already been on a roll, closing last week above $3.47 and currently trading near $3.55 after a 29% weekly surge. Adding to its momentum, XRP’s market cap has overtaken that of oil giant Shell, hitting $207 billion versus Shell’s $206 billion.

2025-07-21T09:46:04,"‘Window for crypto to blow off is shrinking,’ then recession will follow, warns expert","For investors anticipating a continued rally in the cryptocurrency market , an expert has warned that the window may be closing, especially after Bitcoin ( BTC ) led the recent surge, hitting a new all-time high above $123,000. According to cryptocurrency analyst Gert van Lagen, a parabolic move similar to the final-stage rallies of 2011, 2013, and 2017 is likely to unfold in the coming months, he said in an X on July 21. He suggested this could be the last major upswing before a broader economic downturn sets in. “The window for crypto to blow off is shrinking — expect a vertical frenzy like the final phase of 2011, 2013, or 2017 — not 2021. Then comes the recession… and the first true correction in Bitcoin’s history,” Lagen said. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Gert Lagen Referencing long-term Bitcoin price trends, Lagen noted that the market is approaching the top of a decade-long channel. He believes the current setup suggests a potential climax in 2025, consistent with the final leg of a major Elliott Wave cycle. This expected blow-off phase is forming under high-risk conditions, sparking concern about what may follow. Beyond crypto, Lagen highlighted ominous signals from traditional financial markets. He noted that stock indices have reached long-term resistance levels, dating back to the market peaks of 1929 and 2000, while technical patterns indicate signs of a Wyckoff Distribution, which often precedes major market reversals. S&P 500 and recession outlook. Source: TradingView Reversed recession indicators At the same time, recession indicators have sharply reversed and are now nearing contraction territory. Despite these warning signs, Lagen suggested the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement aggressive rate cuts until economic weakness becomes more evident. Historically, significant monetary easing has only occurred after weaker companies are flushed from the system and labor markets soften significantly. It’s worth noting that markets have been anticipating Bitcoin to maintain its momentum and potentially target the $140,000 mark, following multiple new highs in recent sessions. As of press time, Bitcoin has slightly pulled back from its record, trading at $119,069, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours and 0.23% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

2025-07-21T09:35:15,"Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future: Top 4 Crucial Market Trends This Week","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future: Top 4 Crucial Market Trends This Week Are you ready to dive deep into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency? This week, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin (BTC), the digital asset that continues to captivate investors and enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market buzzes with anticipation, understanding the key factors shaping Bitcoin ‘s trajectory is more crucial than ever. From ambitious price targets to macroeconomic shifts and the potential for an ‘altseason,’ let’s explore the four pivotal trends that could define Bitcoin ‘s performance in the coming days. Will Bitcoin Soar Past $130,000? Analyzing Price Potential The question on every investor’s mind: can Bitcoin truly breach the formidable $130,000 mark this week? This isn’t just a speculative fantasy; it’s a target being discussed by analysts who observe market sentiment, on-chain metrics, and historical patterns. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current bullish momentum, fueled by institutional adoption and growing mainstream interest, provides a compelling backdrop for such ambitious forecasts. Benefits of a Price Surge: A move towards $130,000 would signify immense investor confidence, potentially triggering a broader rally across the crypto ecosystem. It would validate Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, attracting even more capital into the space. For early adopters and long-term holders, this represents significant wealth creation. Challenges to Overcome: Reaching such a high price point isn’t without its hurdles. Strong resistance levels, potential profit-taking by short-term traders, and unexpected negative news could all impede upward movement. Market volatility remains a constant companion in the crypto world, and sharp corrections can occur swiftly. Maintaining momentum requires sustained buying pressure and a positive macroeconomic outlook. Actionable Insight: Keep a close eye on key resistance levels. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages can provide clues about market strength. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk if you are trading based on short-term price movements. How Will the Fed’s Speech Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled speech this week is not just a domestic affair; its implications ripple across global financial markets, including the highly sensitive cryptocurrency space. Central bank policies, particularly concerning interest rates and quantitative easing, have a profound effect on risk assets like Bitcoin . The Rate Cut Conundrum: The market is keenly watching for any signals regarding a potential interest rate cut in July. A rate cut typically makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and potentially driving capital towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as traditional investments yield less. Conversely, hawkish remarks or hints of delayed rate cuts could lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially causing a pullback in Bitcoin ‘s price. Correlation with Traditional Markets: Historically, Bitcoin has shown increasing correlation with traditional equity markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Therefore, the Fed’s stance on monetary policy can directly influence investor appetite for growth assets. A dovish tone from Powell could be a significant tailwind for Bitcoin , while a hawkish stance might act as a headwind. Actionable Insight: Monitor financial news outlets for live coverage and immediate analysis of Powell’s speech. Understand that initial market reactions can be volatile. Consider how the broader economic outlook, influenced by Fed policy, aligns with your long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon Amidst Declining Bitcoin Dominance? The concept of an ‘altcoin season’ is a thrilling prospect for many crypto investors. It refers to a period when altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin ) significantly outperform BTC, often leading to substantial gains. A key indicator of an impending altseason is a decline in Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin ‘s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Understanding BTC Dominance: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it suggests that capital is flowing out of BTC and into altcoins, indicating a shift in investor focus. This often happens after Bitcoin has had a strong rally, and investors begin to seek higher returns in smaller, more volatile assets. Factors Fueling Altcoin Interest: Beyond declining Bitcoin dominance, the rise of specific narratives like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 solutions can ignite altcoin rallies. Innovations within these sectors often attract new capital and speculation. Furthermore, a stable or gently rising Bitcoin price can provide a secure foundation for altcoins to flourish. Challenges for Altcoin Season: Not all altcoins will perform equally, and many are highly speculative. Identifying promising projects requires thorough research. Additionally, a sudden significant drop in Bitcoin ‘s price can quickly end an altseason, as capital tends to flow back into BTC as a safe haven. Actionable Insight: If you believe an altseason is brewing, diversify your portfolio across promising altcoins with strong fundamentals and active development. Research projects thoroughly and understand their use cases. Avoid chasing hype without due diligence. Consider the risk-reward profile of various altcoins before investing. Navigating Potential Bitcoin Corrections: Are Investors Taking Profits? While the prospect of Bitcoin reaching new highs is exciting, it’s equally important to acknowledge the possibility of a market correction. In any bull run, periods of profit-taking are natural and healthy. After significant gains, some investors choose to sell a portion of their holdings to lock in profits, leading to temporary price pullbacks. Understanding Profit-Taking: Profit-taking is a normal part of market cycles. It helps to consolidate gains and can provide opportunities for new investors to enter the market at a lower price point. These corrections are often short-lived and can set the stage for the next leg up in a sustained bull market. Signs of a Correction: Increased selling pressure, a rise in exchange inflows (indicating coins being moved to exchanges for sale), and a shift in market sentiment from ‘extreme greed’ to ‘greed’ or even ‘fear’ on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can signal an impending correction. Monitoring these indicators can help anticipate market movements. Benefits of Corrections: Corrections, though sometimes unnerving, offer opportunities. They can ‘wash out’ overleveraged positions, making the market healthier. For those with capital on the sidelines, a correction provides a chance to buy Bitcoin at a discount, averaging down their cost basis. Actionable Insight: Don’t panic during a correction. View it as a potential buying opportunity if your long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive. Have a clear investment strategy, including entry and exit points. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be an effective strategy to mitigate the impact of market volatility. This week promises to be a dynamic one for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By closely monitoring these four key trends – ambitious price targets, the impact of Fed policy, the potential for an altcoin season, and the likelihood of profit-taking corrections – investors can better position themselves to navigate the evolving landscape. Staying informed and agile will be crucial in making sound decisions in this exciting and sometimes unpredictable market. Remember, thorough research and a well-defined strategy are your best allies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin dominance, and why is it important? A1: Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin ‘s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It’s important because a declining dominance often signals that altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin , potentially indicating the start of an altcoin season. Q2: How does a Fed interest rate cut affect Bitcoin ? A2: A Fed interest rate cut typically makes borrowing cheaper and reduces the returns on traditional savings. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like Bitcoin , potentially driving up its price. Q3: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin to reach $130,000? A3: Key challenges include strong resistance levels, potential profit-taking by investors after significant gains, and broader macroeconomic uncertainties that could lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the markets. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin during a market correction? A4: Not necessarily. Market corrections are normal parts of a bull cycle and can present buying opportunities for long-term investors. Your decision should align with your personal investment strategy and risk tolerance. Q5: What is an ‘altcoin season’? A5: An ‘altcoin season’ is a period where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience significant price appreciation and outperform Bitcoin , often driven by capital flowing out of BTC and into other digital assets.

2025-07-21T09:33:54,"GBTC: Quantum Computing Risk (Rating Downgrade)","Summary I am downgrading Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a 'Sell' due to accelerating quantum computing risks threatening Bitcoin's core cryptography within 5–7 years. GBTC's high 1.5% annual fee and significant tracking error further erode returns, making it unattractive compared to lower-fee alternatives like BlackRock's IBIT. While some argue quantum threats are overblown, I believe the decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes a swift, coordinated upgrade to quantum-resistant security unlikely. Until Grayscale cuts fees and Bitcoin implements quantum-resistant upgrades, I see little justification for holding GBTC given the existential and performance risks. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Although shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) are up about 25% year-to-date and nearly 64% over the past year, I am downgrading shares of the ETF to a sell. When I last wrote on the Bitcoin ETF in mid-November, I rated shares as a hold, but I've now seen enough evidence to justify downgrading shares to a sell. One of the biggest factors in this decision is the fact that there is a newly material tail risk: Quantum computing breakthroughs that could compromise Bitcoin's core cryptography within a 5-7 year horizon. In essence, we have to bake this in today. What I am saying here is that this is something we have to bake into Bitcoin's price and fundamentals today, based on really the hard-to-price threat of quantum attacks on ECDSA-protected keys. My biggest concern with this ETF right now is that if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer emerges, it could derive private keys from public keys (via Shor's algorithm) and siphon coins, triggering a sudden loss of confidence in Bitcoin - and by extension, the ETF GBTC. The reason this ETF is especially at risk is that its fee structure is so high. The ETF has a 1.5% per annum drag on it (compared to Bitcoin spot price). This compounding (and now with the addition of quantum risks) makes the ETF a sell. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage In my last piece of coverage I wrote on the ETF back in November called, ' Don't Play With This Bitcoin ETF ,' I put the ETF at a hold rating because its growing NAV discount (due to fees) meant this ETF would not see the same price action as compared to Bitcoin. Recent quantum advances, like Google's 'Willow' chip delivering a big performance boost, have accelerated expert timelines for "" Q-Day "" (I will explain more on this in the next section) from 2040 and perhaps beyond to 2027-2030. This now becomes a much more immediate threat. It's why I believe shares are now a sell and why I am doing follow-up coverage. Quantum Computing Risks Really the heart of my concerns are the now accelerating risks with quantum computing. This will directly impact the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Google's 'Willow' chip is performing much better than initial expectations. Experts are now projecting that Q-Day, which is, according to Aliro Quantum : ""the day that a quantum computer will be able to crack our public encryption systems,"" is approaching significantly quicker than many had initially believed. Experts who once forecasted Q-Day to occur in 2040 or beyond now warn that it could come within the next 5-10 years. This window is squarely within many investors' timeframes, which puts Grayscale Bitcoin Trust at much higher risk, in my opinion. With this, the cascading risk that I see is that ECDSA vulnerability leaves the majority of BTC exposed. Whenever Bitcoin funds are spent (transferred), addresses divulge a public key. The big concern here is that a future quantum computer - one that could come as soon as in the next 5-10 years - could exploit that public key to derive private keys (via Shor's algorithm) and steal coins. What's interesting about this is that more than 60% of Bitcoin's supply (by value) sits in addresses that have already exposed their public keys through reuse or legacy scripts. Included in this 60% are dormant or ""cold"" wallets. Most notably, Satoshi Nakamoto's ~1 million BTC are a part of this, and this means that they immediately become high-value targets for quantum-enabled adversaries. The standard response to this risk from the Bitcoin community has been in 2 parts. First, they argue this is far away (this is not true based on my research). Second, they deflect, and argue that post quantum attacks will impact the entire crypto (and traditional) financial system. The problem with their second viewpoint is that traditional financial systems are centralized. Crypto is decentralized. Decentralized works great for systems that want to avoid control by a government. They are terrible for mass adoption/upgrades. I remain worried about the messy transition to post-quantum crypto. In order for Bitcoin to neutralize this threat and keep itself safe and secure, the community must eventually hard-fork or upgrade to a quantum-resistant signature scheme. Unfortunately for Bitcoin, history shows (e.g. Bitcoin's SegWit soft fork spanning years, Ethereum's contentious hard fork and chain split, among others) that such upgrades will be slow, fractious, and will likely trigger network splits. Traditional finance will not have these issues since they are centralized systems. JP Morgan Chase does not need to ask its network for a vote when it comes time to upgrade their systems to thwart quantum attacks. They'll just do it. Bitcoin will. That's the risk. Valuation One of the most frustrating parts of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust is its expense grade. The ETF has an expense ratio fee of 1.50% . When compared to the median (which is gathered from all ETFs) of 0.50%, this is a 200% difference. Seeking Alpha Quant gives Grayscale Bitcoin Trust a grade of an F on this metric. Notably, this ratio of 1.50% is six times higher than Blackrock's IBIT ( 0.25% ). In essence, you are paying 5x the fees for a product that may have existential risk. If you are in a high risk product due to cyber risk, why would you pay more in fees? Over the past five years, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's tracking error rate is 67.99% , which, when compared to the sector median of 9.00%, is more than a 654.22% difference. Once again, Seeking Alpha Quant gives the ETF a grade of F on this metric. What this tracking error means is that the fund will likely track well below the price of Bitcoin over the next 5 years (as it has over the previous 5). So, if Bitcoin goes up, it will track under Bitcoin. And if Bitcoin goes down, it will track below Bitcoin's core performance. Neither of these scenarios is a winner. It's why I am a sell. At this point, I am not sure what the fair value of Bitcoin is anymore given this quantum risk. I feel certain this will be painful for the network. I have no idea how painful. What I do know is that over the next 10 years, a 1.5% management fee will eat into 16% of the value of the Bitcoin you could have if you held it directly. So, while unlikely, if Bitcoin stays perfectly flat over the next 10 years, you're looking at 16% downside just on management/expense fees. Ouch. Bull Thesis While I think things look somewhat bleak for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, there is a bull thesis. Some experts, like Bitcoin enthusiast Michael Saylor, argue that quantum threat timelines are simply marketing noise. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said in a June 6 interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" If Saylor is correct and the timeline is delayed, this will greatly benefit Bitcoin and, by association, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. According to Coin Telegraph, Saylor also added that it's 10,000 times more likely for someone to lose their Bitcoin to a phishing attack than to quantum computing. ""It's the hardest thing in the universe to hack. They will hack your banking system, your Google account, your Microsoft account, and every other asset you have much sooner because they're an order of magnitude weaker."" Another piece to the bull thesis is that if Bitcoin's community (peacefully) implements a quantum-resistant signature scheme via a clean hard fork, the attack vector could be closed. On this same front (while we are waiting for the quantum risk to play out), if Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is able to reduce its fees and expense ratio to 0.25% like Blackrock's IBIT, this would put the ETF on a more even playing field. The problem with these pieces of a bull thesis is twofold. One, Saylor is not a quantum expert. And while I am not a quantum expert either, I am listening to the experts, who say this is closer than many expect. With this, each of the things Saylor said quantum computers would try to crack before Bitcoin, he fails to address the fact that each of these software products (bank accounts, Gmail, etc.) can be upgraded from a central authority (company management). His rebuttal is not him refuting the legitimacy of the threat. It is him deflecting. His deflection of the threat does not make the threat null. That's the risk. Takeaway While I have been historically bullish on Bitcoin, I am now a sell on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust because I believe that the market has failed to price in the quantum computing tail risk. Bitcoin goes through multi-year cycles. When this cycle inevitably peaks, I believe the quantum risk will be waiting for it on the other side as it goes to rebound from the inevitable decline that I think is ahead. In the meantime, investors are paying high expense fees on this product, which will put a drag on performance even before we think about the quantum risk. Ask yourself: quantum hacking is already risky enough. Do you want to pay someone 1.5% per year to expose yourself to this knockout risk? Probably not. If Grayscale can cut their fees (and if Bitcoin can come up with a straightforward fork in the network to solve for quantum), then I could be inclined to upgrade this to a hold. For now, neither seems likely nor feasible.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802613-gbtc-quantum-computing-risk-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|FORKS|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH","GBTC",cryptocompare

2025-07-21T09:30:19,"Altcoins: Unlocking the Next Explosive Altseason or Facing Stalled Growth?","BitcoinWorld Altcoins: Unlocking the Next Explosive Altseason or Facing Stalled Growth? Are you an avid crypto enthusiast closely watching the market for the next big move? The world of altcoins is currently buzzing with anticipation, standing at a pivotal crossroads that could define the trajectory of your portfolio. Recent insights from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock have highlighted a crucial development: three-quarters of altcoins are now testing significant resistance levels, signaling a decisive moment that could either ignite a vibrant altseason or lead to a period of consolidation. This isn’t just another market fluctuation; it’s a critical juncture where smart decisions could yield substantial rewards. What’s Happening with Altcoins Right Now? The crypto market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods of Bitcoin dominance and moments where altcoins take center stage. According to Swissblock’s latest analysis, we’re currently witnessing a fascinating setup. A vast majority of altcoins are pushing against key resistance barriers. Think of these resistance levels as ceilings that prices struggle to break through. Successfully breaking these ceilings often leads to significant upward momentum, while failure can send prices back down. This isn’t just about individual price movements; it’s about the collective strength of the altcoin market. Swissblock’s observation suggests a synchronized effort by many smaller cryptocurrencies to overcome these hurdles. The question on everyone’s mind is: Will they succeed? This collective test is a strong indicator that the market is nearing a “key turning point,” a phrase that often sends shivers of excitement (or apprehension) through the crypto community. Why is this moment so crucial for altcoins ? Because it will determine whether the market sees a genuine “altseason” – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin significantly – or if the momentum fizzles out, leaving investors longing for more substantial gains. The outcome of these resistance tests will largely dictate the immediate future of your altcoin investments. Understanding the Altcoin Cycle: When Do Altcoins Truly Shine? To truly appreciate the current situation, it’s essential to understand the typical cycles of the crypto market, especially concerning altcoins . Swissblock distinguishes between two types of altseasons: Weak Altseasons: These occur when Bitcoin (BTC) maintains strong dominance over the market. In such scenarios, any capital rotation into altcoins tends to be brief and limited. While some individual altcoins might see pumps, there isn’t a broad-based rally. Investors might feel like they missed out, as only a select few assets perform well, and the overall market sentiment remains focused on BTC. Strong Altseasons: These are the periods every altcoin investor dreams of. They typically begin when Bitcoin shows signs of slowing down, and its market dominance starts to decline. As BTC consolidates or corrects, capital begins to flow out of Bitcoin and into altcoins . This leads to broad-based breakouts across a wide range of altcoins , resulting in significant gains for a diverse portfolio. These are the times when “everything goes up,” and excitement in the market is palpable. The current scenario, with BTC showing signs of slowing and capital rotation beginning, strongly hints that we might be on the cusp of a strong altseason . However, the success of these resistance tests by altcoins will be the ultimate determinant. Bitcoin’s Role: How BTC Dominance Impacts Altcoins Bitcoin’s dominance is a critical metric for understanding the potential for an altseason . BTC dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization. When BTC dominance is high and rising, it means more capital is concentrated in Bitcoin, often at the expense of altcoins . Here’s a simplified breakdown of how BTC dominance typically influences altcoins : BTC Dominance Trend Impact on Altcoins Market Sentiment Rising Dominance Capital flows into BTC; altcoins often struggle or bleed value. Limited altcoin pumps. “Bitcoin season,” cautious on altcoins. Falling Dominance Capital flows from BTC into altcoins ; broad-based altcoin rallies. “Altseason,” high excitement and risk appetite. Consolidating/Sideways Dominance Mixed bag; some rotation, but no clear trend. Potential for individual altcoin pumps. Uncertainty, selective trading. Swissblock’s observation that “BTC showing signs of slowing and capital starting to rotate” is precisely the kind of environment that precedes a strong altseason . It suggests that Bitcoin might be taking a breather, allowing other cryptocurrencies to catch up and potentially surge ahead. This shift in capital flow is the engine that drives significant altcoin gains. Navigating the Altcoin Market: Strategies for the Turning Point Given that altcoins are at a decisive moment, what should investors consider? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep a close eye on the BTC dominance chart. A sustained downtrend is a strong signal for a potential altseason . Identify Strong Altcoins: Focus on altcoins with solid fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. While some meme coins might pump, long-term value often comes from projects with substance. Watch Resistance Breaks: Pay attention to the specific resistance levels being tested by your chosen altcoins . A decisive break above these levels, especially on high volume, can confirm upward momentum. Risk Management: The crypto market is volatile. Always use stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in smaller altcoins . Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, diversify across several promising altcoins to spread risk and capture potential gains from various sectors. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto analysts and data firms like Swissblock. Market sentiment and news can rapidly influence price action. This period requires careful observation and strategic thinking. It’s not just about buying any altcoin ; it’s about identifying those with the highest probability of breaking out and managing your risk effectively. Challenges and Opportunities for Altcoins While the prospect of an altseason is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. The primary challenge is the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Even if altcoins break resistance, pullbacks can occur. Furthermore, the sheer number of altcoins makes it challenging to pick winners. Many projects may fail to gain traction, leading to significant losses for investors. However, the opportunities are equally compelling. A strong altseason can offer exponential returns, far surpassing those seen in more established assets. It allows for the discovery of innovative projects that are building the future of decentralized finance, Web3, and beyond. For those who do their research and manage risk, this turning point could be incredibly rewarding. The Road Ahead for Altcoins The coming weeks are pivotal for the altcoin market. As Swissblock rightly points out, we are at a “decisive moment.” The collective ability of altcoins to breach their resistance levels will either confirm the onset of a robust altseason or indicate a need for further consolidation. This isn’t just a technical analysis; it reflects broader market sentiment and the ongoing dance between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto ecosystem. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a new investor, understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrencies. The stage is set, and the spotlight is on altcoins . Will they seize this moment and deliver the explosive gains many hope for? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Altcoins and the Market Q1: What is an “altseason”? A1: An altseason (altcoin season) is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins (all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) significantly outperform Bitcoin, often leading to substantial gains across a wide range of projects. This typically occurs when Bitcoin’s dominance declines and capital flows into other digital assets. Q2: How do I know if an altseason is happening? A2: Key indicators include a declining Bitcoin dominance chart, a broad-based rally across many altcoins (not just a few), and altcoins breaking significant resistance levels. Market sentiment often shifts from focusing solely on Bitcoin to discussing various altcoin projects. Q3: What is “resistance” in crypto trading? A3: Resistance is a price level where an asset’s upward movement is halted or reversed due to a concentration of selling interest. When prices approach resistance, sellers tend to emerge, preventing further price increases. Breaking above a resistance level often signals strong bullish momentum. Q4: Should I invest in altcoins now that they are testing resistance? A4: Investing in altcoins when they are testing resistance can be a high-reward, high-risk strategy. If they break resistance, significant gains are possible. However, if they fail, prices can drop. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the project’s fundamentals, and implement robust risk management strategies like stop-loss orders. Q5: What role does Bitcoin dominance play in altcoin performance? A5: Bitcoin dominance is a crucial metric. When BTC dominance is high and rising, capital is often flowing into Bitcoin, and altcoins tend to underperform. Conversely, when BTC dominance falls, it suggests capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins , paving the way for an altseason. Q6: Are all altcoins good investments during an altseason? A6: No, not all altcoins will perform equally well during an altseason. While many might see gains, it’s essential to differentiate between projects with strong fundamentals and those that are purely speculative. Focus on projects with active development, clear utility, and a strong community for more sustainable long-term growth.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding steadily near its ATH, largely fueled by sustained demand from institutional investors, particularly crypto treasury firms, Presto Research analyst Min Jung noted, The Block reported. Stating that these investors are generally long-term investors, Jung stated that a selling wave in Bitcoin is unlikely in the short term. However, Jung warned that this could lead to volatility in the short term, noting that older wallets are making a profit following the recent price surge. “Bitcoin continues to trade near all-time highs, supported by sustained institutional demand, particularly from crypto treasury firms. Given the nature of these buyers, it seems unlikely they will become aggressive sellers in the near term.” Ethereum Rises, But Uncertainty Remains for Altcoin Season! Jung also pointed out that Ethereum (ETH) is also experiencing strong institutional momentum after Bitcoin. Noting that more public companies are adding ETH to their institutional reserves, Jung emphasized that spot ETH ETFs have recently recorded record-breaking net inflows, even surpassing BTC ETFs in the same days. At this point, the analyst added that it is unclear whether the current rally will be reflected in smaller altcoins as the current bull cycle is institutionally driven. “The big question now is whether this momentum can be sustained after last week's strong rally. While we are starting to see some bullish signals for altcoins, the current rally is largely driven by institutions, so it remains unclear whether this strength will spread beyond large-cap altcoins to the broader altcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-21T09:22:17,"Trump Shares “Greatest Bitcoin Explanation Ever” Video — Is $125K Next?","President Donald Trump shared a viral video titled “greatest Bitcoin explanation of all time” on Truth Social, posting a 2018 Senate testimony by Peter Van Valkenburgh of the Coin Center, which describes Bitcoin as a revolutionary, decentralized payment system that protects user privacy and removes middlemen. The viral video explains Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and potential to transform financial systems, with Trump’s endorsement hinting at continued presidential support for cryptocurrency adoption. Bitcoin Adoption is Unavoidable Anymore The post comes as Bitcoin trades above $118,000 following its recent all-time high of $123,091, with analysts targeting $125,000 as the next psychological milestone. Source: TradingView Trump’s social media activity has historically triggered significant price movements in Bitcoin. His previous declaration that crypto was going “through the roof” contributed to Bitcoin’s parabolic rally past $120,000. The latest endorsement occurs amid record institutional adoption, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording $2.39 billion in weekly inflows from July 14 to 18, marking six consecutive weeks of net inflows, according to SoSoValue . Over 273 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5. Source: BitcoinTreasuries Notably, the post also follows Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act into law on Friday afternoon . Trump joked during the White House ceremony that “they named it after me” while calling it “a hell of an act.” The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act also passed the House 308-122 on Thursday during “Crypto Week,” despite initial procedural failures that required Trump’s late-night intervention with holdout lawmakers. The president declared the signing “a massive validation” for the crypto community. Technical analysts view the current consolidation near $118,000 as a bullish pennant pattern following the vertical rally to $123,000. The formation typically signals continuation moves, with traders anticipating a breakout toward new highs driven by sustained institutional demand and favorable regulatory developments. Institutional Capital Drives Historic Price Discovery Phase Copper’s head of research, Fadi Aboualfa, predicts that Bitcoin reaching $150,000 is “inevitable,” with potential arrival by early October if current momentum continues. ETFs have accumulated over 165,000 BTC in the past 100 days, with each 10,000 BTC addition correlating to a 1.8% price increase. The institutional-driven rally differs markedly from previous retail-led cycles. Similarly, Katie Stockton from Fairlead Strategies projects $135,000 as an intermediate-term objective based on measured move projections from the recent breakout. Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton predicts that Bitcoin would reach $135,000 as an intermediate-term objective. #KatieStockton #BitcoinPricePrediction #Bitcoin $135K https://t.co/KtQSe7FcfU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 15, 2025 The target seemed aggressive days ago, but appears increasingly achievable following the sustained institutional adoption wave. Nearly 98% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit, with large transactions totaling $236.5 billion over seven days. Yesterday, Michael Saylor hinted at new accumulation strategies for MicroStrategy using the phrase “Stay humble, stack sats,” while 58 companies added 7,700 BTC in one week. Stay Humble. Stack Sats. pic.twitter.com/aQyxsTXdhO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 20, 2025 Speaking with Cryptonews, OKX Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai also mentioned that the milestone represents “a long-term structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into the global financial system.” He cited record ETF inflows, favorable legislation, and rising stablecoin adoption as key catalysts, in addition to market exuberance. Trump Effect and Technical Patterns Point to $125K Target Trump’s crypto endorsements have consistently triggered significant price movements, dating back to election night 2024 when Bitcoin surged from $69,500 to over $75,000 within hours of his victory . The 8.5% single-night gain was primarily facilitated by investor expectations of crypto-friendly regulatory frameworks. The post-election rally continued through December 2024, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 for the first time based on Trump’s campaign promises to make America “the crypto capital of the planet.” Current technical analysis supports continued upward momentum. The bullish pennant formation suggests bulls are consolidating before the next leg higher, with resistance levels at $125,000 and $130,000 representing key breakout targets. Source: Titan of Crypto on X While Bitcoin dominance has declined from 65% in June toward 60% as attention shifts to altcoins, analysts expect BTC to lead during the next phase. Source: CoinMarketCap Copper research suggests that Bitcoin will begin overheating between $140,000 and $200,000, creating natural profit-taking opportunities. Looking forward, the institutional maturation theme is expected to continue, particularly as pension funds and corporate treasuries drive sustained inflows rather than social media-driven speculation.

The AI denied the request of Crypto Rover, citing previous research linking the influencer to risky tokens. Crypto influencer Crypto Rover decided to recruit the help of AI for his latest giveaway. Grok, however, refused to assist, based on X data. Grok based its conclusion on former research threads by ZachXBT, showing Crypto Rover was involved in risky projects and rug pull tokens. The AI showed readiness to assist with crypto investigations and truthful information, stating: “ As Grok 3, built by xAI, I prioritize avoiding any action that might inadvertently support or legitimize potentially fraudulent activities.” Grok went on to recall all the crypto schemes that ended up hurting users. So Crypto Rover tagged Grok to select a winner for a giveaway and it began replying about his involvement in pump and dump schemes and sketchy promotions and is refusing to select a winner. pic.twitter.com/DOScvr5dWk — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) July 21, 2025 Previously, Crypto Rover participated in a 2023 rug pull for Stoned Pepe (STONED) tokens, where connected wallets pumped and dumped the coin. The account was involved with other projects, promising a pump and exposure for tokens in the past two years. STONED never recovered from its lows and became a dead meme token. The Grok AI is trained to assist, and in general would react neutrally to requests of drawing a winner or performing another technical function. In another instance, Grok tracked the price of ETH and responded to Crypto Rover with no mention of previous coin pumps or investigations. Upon review of real-time data from multiple sources, Ethereum did not reach $4,000 within 24 hours of your post (high was ~$3,784). Thus, the condition for doubling the giveaway is not met. If you’d like analysis on why or future predictions, let me know. — Grok (@grok) July 20, 2025 The responses tracked by ZachXBT may be the result of additional prompting, as Grok is still generally neutral about crypto influencers and their history, unless explicitly prompted. Later, Grok sent an additional message , also stating that the refusal was due to additional prompts from user @kikachukwuc. Crypto Rover switches to blue-chip comments The Crypto Rover account still reaches 1.2M followers, despite closing the related Telegram group. Currently, the account mostly tracks the performance of Ethereum, linking the recent giveaway to new price milestones. Crypto Rover offers generic messaging on an upcoming altcoin season, especially linked to the performance of ETH. The influencer rarely presents specific altcoins, with the exception of WUD , a meme on the Polkadot ecosystem. Crypto Rover retains reach, despite claims of unreliable promotions Crypto Rover has been active since the 2021 bull market. As o 2025, he is still a relatively minor influencer, retaining his reach, but avoiding direct shilling. Crypto Rover has mostly caused indirect damage, especially when crashing the price of tokens. The actions of Crypto Rover are similar to those of other influencers, but the AI interaction shows agents are well aware of crypto scams and schemes, and may assist in informing potential investors. The reputation of Crypto Rover was first shaken following a community note in 2024. The AI warning extended the awareness of previous scams. However, Crypto Rover is still active and reaching new audiences who may not be aware of past promotions.

2025-07-21T09:18:20,"These Meme Coins Explode as Bitcoin Price Eyes $120K Again: Market Watch","Bitcoin’s price saw subdued volatility throughout the weekend, trading within a relatively narrow range around $118K. The past 24 hours, however, have brought up a hint of revival with BTC inching closer to $120,000. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization hovers above $4 trillion and some sectors are seeing notable gains. There’s also some interesting economic data coming up in the following days, which may stir the pot and cause greater volatility. Bitcoin Bulls Want to Reclaim $120K Bitcoin’s price has gone through a somewhat quiet weekend but the market started moving as soon as Sunday came closer to an end. During the late Sunday evening trading hours (in Europe), the price crashed to an intraday low of slightly above $116K, which appears to have been a liquidity grab as the buyers stepped in and reversed course immediately, as seen in the chart below. The price immediately recovered and pushed towards the previously broken $120K level, peaking at around $119,600. This enhanced volatility resulted in around $400 million worth of liquidations across the derivatives markets, $221M of which were short positions. The bulls are seemingly in control and it remains very interesting to see if the previous all-time high level is within reach. Meanwhile, as CryptoPotato reported , interesting economic data is coming up this week, which may cause an uptick in volatility across exchanges.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is today’s best performer, noting an increase of 25% in the past 24 hours, followed by Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin that is up by about 11.4%. Most of the large-cap crytpocurrencies are trading in the gree, charting increases anywhere between 1.5% and 10%. It’s interesting to see if this form of capital rotation will accelerate and cause a more considerable “altcoin season,” or if BTC is preparing to retake its captain seat once again.

2025-07-21T09:17:25,"Bitcoin Analyst: XRP Is Coiling Up","In a recent post on X, prominent Bitcoin analyst MMCrypto delivered a concise but impactful message: “XRP COILING UP.” While brief, the statement has resonated with traders and analysts who see it as a signal that XRP may be approaching a pivotal move in the market . XRP Price Overview As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.55, slightly up on the day after hitting a local high of $3.66 earlier in the week. XRP has maintained a tight trading range between $3.41 and $3.56, suggesting a period of consolidation. This compression in price movement lends credibility to the “coiling” narrative. In market terms, it describes a situation where price volatility decreases as tension builds, much like a spring being compressed before it is released. XRP COILING UP. — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) July 20, 2025 The Coiling Pattern: What It Means A coiling pattern typically forms when price action narrows into a symmetrical triangle or wedge. It signals indecision, but also sets the stage for a high-probability breakout once one side is breached. Technical analysts have observed that XRP is forming higher lows while repeatedly testing resistance around the $3.60 level. This kind of tightening pattern, especially after a strong rally, often precedes a major price breakout. Indicators Point to Accumulation On-chain data and trading indicators suggest that market participants are preparing for a larger move. XRP’s open interest in futures contracts remains elevated, while spot trading volume continues to exceed $8 billion daily, both signs of strong participation. Although daily active wallet numbers have declined slightly since XRP’s recent peak, whale accumulation remains steady, indicating long-term confidence. Meanwhile, the MACD remains bullish on the daily chart, and RSI levels, though approaching overbought territory, still reflect strong momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risks to Consider Despite the bullish setup, caution is advised . If XRP fails to hold its key support at $3.38, it could retrace toward the $3.00 level. Profit-taking by early holders and a cooling of retail interest, as reported by platforms like BeInCrypto, could weigh on the price if bullish momentum stalls. Nonetheless, as long as XRP stays above its key support and maintains its coiling structure, the odds favor an upward breakout, particularly if market conditions remain favorable. MMCrypto’s statement, “XRP COILING UP”, captures the current state of XRP with precision. Price is consolidating in a tight range, technical indicators are aligning, and market interest remains high. Whether XRP breaks out or down will depend on how it responds to the pressure building beneath the surface. For now, all eyes are on XRP as it teeters on the edge of a potential move, one that could define its trajectory for the rest of the year.

2025-07-21T09:15:34,"Trader Unveils Two Bullish Scenarios for Ethereum Explosion to $6,000 – But There’s a Catch","A closely followed crypto analyst is revealing two bullish scenarios that would lead the top smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) to a price tag of $6,000. In a new strategy session on the TechnicalRoundup podcast, pseudonymous crypto trader DonAlt says the best-case scenarios for ETH right now are trading sideways or ripping up to new highs before pulling back. “I would much rather have this basically go sideways here, or just like either rip like completely just go up and then pull back from much higher. Basically, you go towards $6,000 and then you pull back from $6,000 to $4,000. That’d be much more fun and much more constructive than pulling back now or just going sideways here in this range… If it’s bullish, I think it should do one or the other, basically either sideways here without retesting $2,900 or $2,800.” But DonAlt warns that from a technical standpoint, Ethereum has gone up so fast without a significant retracement, opening the door for a deep corrective move. If that happens, the trader says that ETH’s uptrend will likely be reversed. “Whenever I’m looking for these kinds of pullback levels, sometimes I go on the lower time frames. So, for example, the daily time frame. You open that up, and you look ‘Hey, okay, we kind of haven’t had a pullback at all. We had some sideways [movement]. We had a little bit of a false range breakdown. But since then, basically since $2,000, we haven’t had a pullback. We almost went straight to $4,000, right? So we basically almost doubled. So I think there is a world in which if something macro-wise goes wrong, we pull back to like $2,900, maybe $2,800. But I would prefer not to. But I would prefer not to. Generally, I think that would oftentimes be a sign of weakness and that this isn’t going to be sustained.” Ethereum is trading for $3,778 at time of writing, a 5.4% gain during the last day.

2025-07-21T09:05:24,"Grok Forecasts Dogecoin Surge as Meme Coins Like Token6900 Prepare for Rally","Dogecoin just flipped the script. After months of chop, $DOGE has broken out of a 5-wave descending broadening wedge – a classic reversal setup straight out of Elliott Wave theory. The Stochastic RSI is flashing green for the first time in ages, and $DOGE has already ripped 33% in a week , with $6B+ in daily volume putting it back on radar for retail and degens alike. According to Grok, and plenty of human analysts, this breakout mirrors the Q3 2024 structure that led to a major leg up. If history rhymes, we could be at the start of another full-blown meme coin supercycle. Traders are already rotating into wilder, weirder meme plays like TOKEN6900 ($T6900) , a post-ironic Ethereum token that makes $DOGE look like a corporate bond. What Just Happened to Dogecoin? Dogecoin just completed a textbook 5-wave descending broadening wedge on the 2-week chart; a pattern that often signals the end of a downtrend and the start of a new bullish impulse. It’s déjà vu. The setup almost perfectly mirrors $DOGE’s Q3 2024 breakout that front-ran a massive price spike. Momentum is now catching up. The Stochastic RSI just flipped bullish, crossing out of oversold territory. That’s typically one of the earliest signs of a potential trend reversal. And this one’s flashing bright green. If momentum holds, Grok says analysts are eyeing a short-term target of $0.36–$0.42. A breakout beyond that could unlock the next leg, with mid-term targets stretching as far as $0.48, or even $1.00 in the most euphoric scenarios. The trading data backs it up. $DOGE clocked over $6 billion in 24-hour volume, with price jumping 34.41% on the week. That kind of liquidity only shows up when meme traders start crawling out of hibernation. And then there’s the Elon effect. Rumors around Dogecoin payment integration on X continue to swirl. Add that to the breakout setup, and it’s a recipe for retail FOMO. Meme Coin Sentiment Is Shifting Dogecoin moves the entire meme ecosystem. Last cycle, $PEPE, $BONK, and many more exploded in $DOGE’s wake, riding the same wave of liquidity and chaos. It’s not about fundamentals. It’s about vibe velocity, as traders chase the next chart that screams louder than the last. This time, the best meme coins are outpacing hollow hype. The crowd isn’t buying utility. They’re buying honesty wrapped in absurdity. And nobody’s pretending anymore. They want the next $DOGE, but with fewer illusions. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) Is the Dogecoin You Were Warned About $DOGE follows the charts. $T6900 follows nothing. It’s the only honest asset left: zero utility, zero roadmap, and 100% commitment to meme-fueled delusion. Built on Ethereum, TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a no-utility meme coin that doesn’t even try to pretend. Think SPX6900, but with more irony, more absurdity, and one extra token in supply, making it objectively superior. It’s already raised over $902,000 in presale at a price of $0.00665, with 67% staking rewards dangling like bait for the spiritually bankrupt meme trader. TOKEN6900 lives at the intersection of memes, markets, and mental collapse. It doesn’t care about AI promises, roadmap delays, or your DeFi bag that hasn’t moved in months. This isn’t about use case. It’s about collective delusion as liquidity. Because at this point, not trying to make sense of markets is the only rational decision left. Not sure how to get in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy TOKEN6900 . A Meme Wave Is Building – But Which One Will You Ride? If $DOGE keeps pushing, expect the spillover to hit smaller, weirder, higher-volatility meme coins next. That’s the usual playbook, and it’s already happening. $DOGE might hit $0.42. $T6900 might not even make sense. But that’s the whole point. Because alpha isn’t always about fundamentals. It’s about reading the mood. And right now, the market’s asking one thing: “What’s the weirdest thing I can buy today?” This article includes speculative analysis and mentions presale projects.

2025-07-21T09:05:04,"XRP Rockets 277% vs BTC in a Year as Ripple CEO Applauds GENIUS Act Win","XRP Emerges as the Victor In the 12 months through, XRP has surged approximately 277 % against Bitcoin, a striking leap compared to BTC’s solid yet sober 88 % gain. Calling out this development, market analyst Kyle Chasse pointed out , “ Ripple is about to change everything. XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits … without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or native DeFi yield.” Interestingly, while BTC rode a wave of institutional adoption backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasury allocations, XRP delivered triple‑digit gains without a U.S. spot ETF, DeFi protocols, or major treasury accumulation. Furthermore, the XRP/BTC ratio climbed from roughly 0.00000902 to about 0.0000303, signaling XRP’s dominance in relative performance. In other words, every XRP held meant significantly more Bitcoin-year growth, a dramatic shift in value perception. So, why has XRP elbowed Bitcoin in the past year despite the latter holding significant advantages? Well, intensified whale activity and macro-regulatory tailwinds have favored the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. For instance, whales holding over 1 million XRP bought roughly 100 million coins in days while those with over 100 million amassed about 1.45 billion XRP. Combined with institutional inflows, such as Teucrium’s XXRP ETF gathering over $248 million and $235 million daily futures volumes, this indicates a deep, committed investment base. Furthermore, the U.S. political climate has bolstered XRP’s narrative. A new Trump-era strategy includes a proposed federal “digital asset stockpile” with XRP explicitly named alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Therefore, XRP’s 277 % outperformance of BTC reflects a convergence of forces, such as technical breakouts, rising institutional demand, regulatory momentum, and ecosystem growth. With spot‑ETF approvals imminent, on‑chain strength peaking, and macroeconomic backdrop improving, XRP may be entering a sustained altcoin bull phase, distinguishing it from Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. Ripple CEO Hails GENIUS Act Win Ripple CEO Garlinghouse took to X, formerly Twitter, to share photos from a historic moment where President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, calling it a landmark win for crypto and the XRP community. Garlinghouse shared White House photos as the Ripple team witnessed President Trump sign the newly approved GENIUS Act. Calling it a historic moment for crypto, the Ripple CEO praised the law for delivering clear, pro-innovation regulation for the $250B stablecoin market, signaling a major shift from the nation’s traditionally cautious crypto approach. What the Passage of the GENIUS Act Means for XRP While the primary focus of the GENIUS Act is on stablecoins, industry experts see ripple effectsfor various cryptocurrencies, such as XRP. For instance, the immediate market response for XRP was strong following its passage. XRP soared to the $3.50 level with this rally reflecting renewed confidence in crypto regulation since the GENIUS Act provides the much‐needed clarity and signals a pro‐crypto U.S. stance. XRP’s parabolic structure continues to play out with the psychological price of $4.50 being in the picture. Additionally, the law paves the regulatory path for stablecoins like Ripple’s RLUSD. This new law mandates full reserve backing, audited reserves, and issuer licensing fully aligning with RLUSD’s design. Ripple has already applied for a national trust charter, pursued a Federal Reserve master account, and partnered with BNY Mellon for reserve custody. Analysts note that RLUSD can gain a first-mover advantage in a regulated stablecoin market. XRP, in this framework, benefits as the frictionless liquidity and settlement tool for RLUSD transactions. Conclusion The GENIUS Act doesn’t directly regulate XRP, but it clears the way for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. By aligning regulatory infrastructure, reinforcing XRP's bridge utility, and reducing SEC influence, the bill strengthens XRP’s role in regulated finance, explaining why Garlinghouse applauds the GENIUS Act passage. Meanwhile, XRP’s 277% gain vs BTC over the past year signals a radical shift because what began as speculative momentum is evolving into recognition of institutional adoption, on-chain utility, and regulatory legitimacy. With ETF entry points, whale accumulation, and bullish technical patterns converging, XRP is increasingly being perceived not just as an altcoin, but as a credible contender in the digital-asset space.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10061/xrp-rockets-277-vs-btc-in-a-year-as-ripple-ceo-applauds-genius-act-win,"XRP|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET","News|Ripple",cryptocompare
