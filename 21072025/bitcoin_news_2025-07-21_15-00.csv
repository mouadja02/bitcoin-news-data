With capital rotating out of Bitcoin, top altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano are also seeing renewed interest. Solana DeFi TVL Hits $10.26B Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is booming, with total value locked (TVL) jumping to $10.26 billion, the highest in nearly six months. This surge is largely driven by SOL’s price rally. Leading the pack are Jito Sol ($3.09B), Jupiter Exchange ($2.90B), and Kamino Finance ($2.89B). REPORT: @Solana DeFi TVL has surged to $10.26 billion for the first time in 23 weeks, driven by $SOL price appreciation.

That is a 44% increase compared to the previous week, which shows growing interest and inflows into the Solana ecosystem. Also, Solana-based perpetual trading platforms are seeing more Solana liquidations on-chain than all centralized exchanges combined during times of high market activity. This is a sign of shifting trader behavior. Retail Interest and Short Squeeze Push SOL Toward $200 In the past 24 hours alone, over $11 million in SOL short positions were liquidated as the token climbed to $191. The largest single liquidation hit $1.13 million at $188, showing just how fast sentiment is flipping. Solana is also seeing strong retail interest, with open interest in SOL futures jumping to $9.5 billion from $7.1 billion. Trading volume also jumped 80% in the past day to over $20 billion. With more short sellers getting liquidated, the price is being pushed higher, possibly past $200 soon. Strong Inflows Keep Solana in the Spotlight CoinShares report reveals that Solana-based digital asset products like ETFs, funds, and ETPs saw $39.1 million in inflows last week. While Bitcoin led overall with $2.19 billion, Solana inflows were also notable among other altcoins. Solana also continues to lead all Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains in network revenue, now for the 17th straight week, highlighting its strong and consistent on-chain activity. Analysts Eye Breakout It is currently trading at $190.80, up 5.7% in the last 24 hours. Analyst Ali Martinez had recently shared that $189 is a key breakout level for Solana. If SOL moves above it, there are not many strong resistance zones ahead, and the price could climb quickly from there.

While seemingly bearish in his outlook, Kiyosaki implies a crash would actually be a good investment opportunity — If the prices tank, he says, he’ll start buying. “BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING. When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too.” – R. Kiyosaki BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING. When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 21, 2025 Is Bitcoin safe? Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high (ATH), peaking above $123,000 . However, a pullback of roughly 5%, which saw the price drop to the $118,000 range by the time of Kiyosaki’s prediction, might now suggest a potential market cooldown. Moreover, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) info released on July 15 revealed that inflation was higher than expected, having gone up by 2.7%, while the national debt has exceeded $36 trillion. The investor’s predictions thus suggest the mounting pressure is being felt in the crypto market, which is now nearing a valuation of $4 trillion.

2025-07-21T12:40:15,"Bitcoin Investment: Strategy’s Spectacular 6,220 BTC Purchase Soars to 20.8% YTD Yield","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: Strategy’s Spectacular 6,220 BTC Purchase Soars to 20.8% YTD Yield In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes are made and strategies are meticulously crafted, one company consistently stands out for its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin: Strategy. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of their latest, audacious move, signaling not just a significant Bitcoin investment but also a remarkable financial triumph. This isn’t just a ripple in the crypto pond; it’s a tidal wave that speaks volumes about institutional confidence in the digital asset space. Strategy, a leading Bitcoin investment company, recently made headlines with a massive acquisition. They announced on X (formerly Twitter) that they purchased an additional 6,220 BTC for approximately $739.8 million. This significant acquisition was made at an average price of roughly $118,940 per Bitcoin, showcasing a bold move in the market. What’s even more impressive is that this strategic purchase has contributed to an astounding year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield of 20.8% for 2025. As of July 20, the firm now proudly holds a staggering 607,770 BTC, acquired for an estimated $43.61 billion at an average price of around $71,756 per BTC. This latest move reaffirms Strategy’s position as a dominant force in the institutional Bitcoin investment landscape. Decoding Strategy’s Latest Bitcoin Investment Move When a company like Strategy, known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, makes such a substantial purchase, the market takes notice. The acquisition of 6,220 BTC for nearly $740 million at an average price north of $118,000 per coin highlights a profound conviction in Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While this price point might seem high to some, it aligns with Strategy’s long-term vision, demonstrating their belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to appreciate significantly over time, making even current prices attractive for strategic accumulation. To put this latest Bitcoin investment into perspective, let’s look at how it integrates into their existing colossal holdings. Strategy has been systematically adding Bitcoin to its treasury for years, treating it as a primary reserve asset. This latest purchase is another testament to their ‘Bitcoin for corporate treasury’ playbook, which has proven remarkably successful. Bitcoin Investment: Strategy's Spectacular 6,220 BTC Purchase Soars to 20.8% YTD Yield Metric Before Latest Purchase (Approx.) After Latest Purchase (As of July 20) Total BTC Holdings 601,550 BTC 607,770 BTC Total Acquired Cost $42.87 billion $43.61 billion Average Price per BTC $71,260 $71,756 This isn’t merely a transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that underscores Strategy’s profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not just buying Bitcoin; they are building a fortress of digital assets, setting a precedent for how corporations might manage their treasuries in an increasingly digital world. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Impact Strategy’s Portfolio? The impact of this latest acquisition on Strategy’s portfolio is substantial, not just in terms of sheer volume but also in demonstrating the effectiveness of their long-term accumulation strategy. With 607,770 BTC now under their belt, acquired at an average price of approximately $71,756, Strategy possesses one of the largest corporate holdings of Bitcoin globally. This scale provides them with significant leverage and exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. However, the real headline-grabber is the reported 20.8% year-to-date (YTD) yield for 2025. Imagine achieving over a fifth of your initial investment back in profit within just seven months! This figure signifies that, despite the substantial recent purchase at a higher price, Strategy’s overall Bitcoin portfolio has appreciated considerably since the start of the year. This impressive yield is a powerful testament to Strategy’s shrewd capital allocation and the inherent volatility – and potential upside – of the Bitcoin market. It suggests that their earlier, lower-cost acquisitions are providing a significant buffer, allowing them to absorb higher-priced purchases while maintaining a strong overall profit margin. Key takeaways from Strategy’s portfolio performance include: Strategic Averaging: Despite buying at $118,940, their overall average acquisition cost remains much lower, showcasing the power of dollar-cost averaging over time for a large-scale Bitcoin investment . Conviction Over Short-Term Volatility: The consistent purchases, even during market fluctuations, highlight a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its role as a long-term store of value. Leading Indicator: Strategy’s success with this approach serves as a potential blueprint for other corporations considering Bitcoin for their balance sheets. Their reported yield acts as a tangible performance metric that other treasurers might observe closely. This strategy isn’t about day trading; it’s about a long-term vision, treating Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset designed to preserve and grow capital in an inflationary environment. Their consistent performance, evidenced by the impressive YTD yield, validates their aggressive stance. What Does This Bitcoin Investment Signal for the Broader Market? When a company of Strategy’s caliber continues to pour hundreds of millions into Bitcoin, it sends an unmistakable message to the broader financial world. This isn’t just about one company’s balance sheet; it’s a powerful signal that resonates across the global investment landscape, impacting market sentiment and potentially influencing future trends. The implications of such a significant Bitcoin investment are multifaceted: Institutional Confidence: Strategy’s consistent accumulation reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. It suggests that major players are not just dabbling in crypto but are integrating it as a core component of their financial strategy. This can alleviate concerns among more conservative investors about Bitcoin’s legitimacy and long-term viability. Validation of Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: By publicly committing vast sums to Bitcoin, Strategy further solidifies its position as a legitimate treasury reserve asset, akin to gold or other commodities. This move encourages other corporate treasuries to at least consider Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a potential growth asset. Potential for Market Price Impact: While no single purchase guarantees a price surge, large institutional buys contribute to sustained demand, which can provide upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time. It reduces the circulating supply available for retail investors, potentially leading to price appreciation. Enhanced Market Liquidity and Maturity: The entry and continuous participation of large institutions bring more capital and sophistication to the market. This can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility over the long term (though short-term swings remain), and a more mature financial ecosystem around digital assets. However, it’s also crucial to consider the challenges and potential risks that institutional adoption, while largely positive, might entail. The crypto market remains dynamic and subject to rapid shifts. Regulatory clarity is still evolving in many jurisdictions, and price swings can be significant. While institutional presence can bring stability, it also means that large sales could have a pronounced impact, though companies like Strategy emphasize a long-term holding strategy. Actionable Insights from Strategy’s Bitcoin Investment Success Strategy’s remarkable journey and impressive yield offer valuable lessons for individual investors looking to navigate the volatile yet potentially rewarding world of cryptocurrency. While most don’t have billions to deploy, the underlying principles of their Bitcoin investment strategy can be adapted. Here are some actionable insights: Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Strategy’s success story isn’t built on chasing quick gains but on a steadfast belief in Bitcoin’s future as a store of value and a foundational digital asset. For individual investors, this means resisting the urge to panic sell during dips or get caught up in short-term hype. Think in terms of years, not days or weeks. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): While Strategy makes large lump-sum purchases, their consistent accumulation over time effectively mimics a form of DCA. For the average investor, this translates to consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price fluctuations. It smooths out your average purchase price, reduces the risk of trying to ‘time the market,’ and builds your holdings systematically. Conviction Backed by Research: Strategy’s willingness to buy at higher price points reflects deep conviction. This conviction should stem from thorough research into Bitcoin’s technology, its economic principles, network effects, and macroeconomic trends. Understand why you are investing before you put your capital at risk. Prioritize Security: Holding a significant amount of Bitcoin means security is paramount. For individual investors, this means using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts, and considering hardware wallets (cold storage) for larger holdings. Never share your private keys or seed phrases. Manage Risk Appropriately: While Bitcoin offers immense potential, it’s also highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, even if it’s your primary crypto holding. Understand your own risk tolerance and stick to it. Learning from institutional giants like Strategy isn’t about copying their every move but understanding the strategic rationale behind their decisions. Their disciplined approach to Bitcoin investment offers a blueprint for navigating the digital asset landscape with greater confidence. Strategy’s latest Bitcoin investment is more than just a headline; it’s a masterclass in conviction and strategic asset management. Their impressive 20.8% YTD yield for 2025 highlights the immense potential that lies within the digital asset space for those with a long-term vision and a robust strategy. As institutional adoption continues to grow, such moves by major players like Strategy will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, paving the way for a more integrated digital financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strategy’s primary business model? Strategy is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, under the leadership of its executives, it has strategically shifted its corporate treasury strategy to focus heavily on Bitcoin acquisition, making it a prominent Bitcoin investment firm. Why is Strategy buying so much Bitcoin? Strategy’s rationale for accumulating Bitcoin is rooted in its belief that Bitcoin is a superior store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a digital asset with long-term appreciation potential. They view it as a primary treasury reserve asset that can protect and grow shareholder value over time. What does a 20.8% YTD yield mean for an investment company? A 20.8% Year-to-Date (YTD) yield means that the value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings has increased by 20.8% since the beginning of the year (January 1st, 2025). This indicates strong performance and significant unrealized gains on their overall Bitcoin investment portfolio. Is Strategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy risky? While aggressive, Strategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy is a calculated risk based on their deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It does expose them to Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, but they manage this by maintaining a long-term holding period and consistently acquiring more, aiming to benefit from future appreciation rather than short-term fluctuations. How can individual investors learn from Strategy’s approach? Individual investors can learn to adopt a long-term perspective, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to smooth out purchase prices, conduct thorough due diligence before investing, prioritize robust security measures for their holdings, and manage their risk exposure by only investing what they can afford to lose.

2025-07-21T12:37:57,"Billionaire Michael Saylor Boosts Bitcoin Holdings with New 6,220 BTC Purchase","Billionaire executive chairman Michael Saylor has bolstered his firm’s bitcoin war chest once again. Strategy, disclosed on Monday that it had acquired an additional 6,220 BTC for approximately $739.8 million, at an average price of $118,940 per bitcoin during the week ending July 20, 2025. Strategy has acquired 6,220 BTC for ~$739.8 million at ~$118,940 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.8% YTD 2025. As of 7/20/2025, we hodl 607,770 $BTC acquired for ~$43.61 billion at ~$71,756 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/8z5HygrDWs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 21, 2025 This aggressive accumulation brings the company’s total bitcoin holdings to a staggering 607,770 BTC, purchased at an aggregate cost of $43.61 billion, or an average price of $71,756 per BTC. Purchase Funded via ATM Equity Offerings The filing shows that the bitcoin purchase was financed through proceeds raised under Strategy’s at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which span several security classes. Between July 14 and July 20, Strategy raised $740.3 million across four separate ATM programs: MSTR Shares (Common Stock): 1,636,373 shares sold, generating $736.4M in net proceeds STRK Preferred Shares (8.00% Strike): 5,441 shares sold, raising $0.7M STRF Preferred Shares (10.00% Strife): 2,000 shares sold for $0.2M STRD Preferred Shares (10.00% Stride): 31,282 shares sold for $3.0M Each of these instruments falls under massive, multi-billion-dollar issuance programs, including a $21B authorization for both MSTR and STRK classes, demonstrating Saylor’s continued ability to convert equity into bitcoin reserves at scale. Strategy Now Holds Over $43B in BTC As of July 20, the company holds over $43 billion worth of bitcoin, solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. With bitcoin’s price well above Strategy’s average acquisition cost, the firm is enjoying a year-to-date BTC yield of 20.8% in 2025, reaffirming the effectiveness of its long-term crypto treasury strategy. Saylor remains vocal in his conviction that bitcoin is the world’s ultimate store of value. The latest acquisition shows his belief that corporate treasuries should hold bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. Strategy’s accumulating pace and financial engineering continue to make it a bellwether for institutional crypto adoption. Bitcoin’s Minor Pullback from $123K ATH Bitcoin experienced a potential deeper pullback during Asia trading hours on Monday, after consolidating near $117,000. The crypto is currently just below last week’s all-time high of $123,000 and is retracing, trading just above $118,263 at the time of writing. Bitcoin has displayed a bullish pennant pattern following a strong vertical rally to $123K. A pennant or a flag formation in July indicates the impending continuation of a strong upward price movement. Despite Bitcoin’s minor 24-hour decline, several key market announcements have signalled ongoing bullish momentum. For instance, Saylor on Saturday hinted at a new Bitcoin accumulation strategy for his largest corporate BTC holder Strategy, using the phrase “Stay humble, stack sats.” The post Billionaire Michael Saylor Boosts Bitcoin Holdings with New 6,220 BTC Purchase appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-michael-saylor-boosts-bitcoin-holdings-with-new-6220-btc-purchase/,"BTC|TRADING|STRK|ASIA|BUSINESS","Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor|Strategy",cryptocompare

As Bitcoin paused, altcoins surged aggressively, with many large caps like Ethereum and XRP outperforming for the first time in months . This shift in momentum triggered a 6.9 percent decline in Bitcoin dominance, the largest since December 2023, suggesting the market is rotating into higher beta assets, a hallmark of mid-cycle expansion phases. Despite Bitcoin’s consolidation, it continues to trade well above the realised cost basis of 95 percent of holders, highlighting that most of the supply sits in profit. This historically marks late-stage bullish phases where profit-taking by short-term holders intensifies. Long-term holders have started distributing coins for the first time since early 2024, while ETFs, retail, and newer market participants absorb that supply. This natural rotation between holder classes reflects a maturing cycle , but it also raises near-term fragility, especially if buyer momentum fades. Bitcoin briefly pulled back to $115,820 after testing the +1 standard deviation band (σ) above the Short-Term Holder cost basis at $120,000, a zone that historically attracts distribution. For the rally to continue, the next resistance lies at the +2σ band near $136,000 —a level associated with overbought conditions and peak market exuberance. Sustaining momentum to reach that level will likely require renewed institutional inflows or strong macro tailwinds to absorb profit-taking pressure. For now, the baton has passed to altcoins, but Bitcoin’s structural strength remains intact—just entering a more delicate, reactive phase. In the macro economy it is becoming clearer that tariff-driven inflation is surfacing, with June’s CPI rising 0.3 percent and core inflation up 2.9 percent annually, as higher import costs from China and other key US trading partners push up prices in consumer goods like appliances and apparel. While shelter and services inflation shows mild easing, producer price data points to rising upstream costs and potential “stagflation-lite” risks, prompting the Fed to hold off on rate cuts for now . Despite these inflationary pressures, US retail sales rebounded by 0.6 percent in June, driven by auto sales and preemptive consumer buying ahead of further tariff hikes, though real consumption gains remain marginal . Labour market data adds to the mixed picture—initial jobless claims are down, but continuing claims and slower wage growth suggest potential softening ahead. In crypto, institutional adoption surged as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) became the first public company to hold over 600,000 BTC , now valued above $73 billion. Meanwhile, Hungary imposed strict penalties for unlicensed crypto trading, forcing major platforms to suspend services, and Kazakhstan is weighing crypto allocations in its sovereign reserves.

2025-07-21T12:30:44,"Crypto ETPs See Record $4.4B Inflows as Bitcoin and Ether Surge","Crypto investment products saw record-breaking inflows last week, marking the 14th consecutive week of gains for crypto ETPs. According to CoinShares, global crypto ETPs recorded $4.4 billion in inflows for the trading week ending Friday, driven by strong market momentum and renewed investor interest. The inflows came as Bitcoin surged past $122,000 for the first time on July 14, before pulling back to an intraweek low of around $116,000 and closing the week near $120,000, data from CoinGecko showed. With the latest gains, year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs reached a new high of $27 billion, while total assets under management in crypto ETPs crossed $220 billion for the first time. Ether ETPs Hit Record Inflow Ether-focused investment products were a major contributor to the latest inflows, with Ether ETPs posting double their previous weekly record at $2.12 billion. The year-to-date inflows for Ether ETPs reached $6.2 billion, surpassing the total inflows recorded for 2024, according to CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill. The surge in inflows coincided with ETH crossing $3,500 for the first time since early January, a significant recovery from April’s lows when ETH dropped below $1,500 amid market pressure . Butterfill noted that the past 13 weeks of consistent inflows now represent 23% of Ethereum’s assets under management in ETPs, indicating a strong return of investor confidence in Ether as market conditions improved. Bitcoin and Altcoins Maintain Momentum Despite Minor Outflows Bitcoin ETPs also maintained solid inflows, recording $2.2 billion last week, which accounted for 50% of total crypto ETP inflows. The resilience in Bitcoin inflows came even as BTC hit new all-time highs, contrasting with the brief slowdown seen earlier in July as investors grew cautious at higher price levels. Other altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Sui also saw notable inflows of $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, reflecting broader interest across the crypto sector. Despite the strong overall inflows, some US issuers recorded minor outflows during the week. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest led the losses, posting $120 million in outflows, including an $8.7 million sell-off from its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Fidelity Investments and ProShares experienced outflows of $49 million and $25 million, respectively, while CoinShares recorded minor outflows of $25 million, adding to $18 million in outflows from the previous week. The continued strength in crypto ETP inflows, paired with Bitcoin and Ether’s market resilience, signals sustained institutional interest in crypto assets despite minor corrections and profit-taking, setting a strong foundation for the coming months in the crypto investment landscape.

2025-07-21T12:25:28,"Shocking: Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Shocking: Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples through the investor community, as the Bitcoin price experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $118,000 mark. For many, this sudden shift prompts questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, understanding these movements in the Bitcoin price is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement According to recent market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has indeed dropped, with reports indicating it trading at $117,981.03 on the Binance USDT market. This movement, while perhaps unsettling for some, is a characteristic feature of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets, digital currencies like Bitcoin are known for their rapid fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors ranging from global economic sentiment to specific technological developments. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the immediate data: Current Trading Price: $117,981.03 Exchange Monitored: Binance USDT market Key Threshold Breached: $118,000 This particular drop highlights the constant ebb and flow that defines the journey of the Bitcoin price . It’s a reminder that while Bitcoin has shown incredible long-term growth, short-term volatility remains a constant companion. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall? Unpacking the Factors When the Bitcoin price takes a dip, it’s rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment, and specific industry news. Here are some common factors that could influence such a move: Global Economic Climate Broader economic concerns, such as inflation fears, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk. This means moving away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies towards more traditional, perceived-as-safer investments. When the global economic outlook becomes uncertain, the Bitcoin price can often feel the ripple effect. Regulatory Scrutiny News or rumors of increased regulatory scrutiny in major markets can also impact the Bitcoin price . Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, and any perceived tightening of rules can trigger sell-offs as investors anticipate potential restrictions or compliance burdens. Whale Movements and Market Liquidity Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence the Bitcoin price with their buying or selling activities. A substantial sell-off by a whale or a group of whales can quickly increase supply on exchanges, leading to a downward price pressure. Additionally, market liquidity – how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price – plays a role. Lower liquidity can amplify price movements. Technical Analysis Triggers For many traders, technical analysis plays a crucial role. Breaking below a significant support level, like $118,000, can trigger automated sell orders or encourage further selling from traders who follow these patterns, contributing to the downward momentum of the Bitcoin price . Historical Context: Is This Bitcoin Price Drop Normal? For those new to the crypto space, a sudden drop in the Bitcoin price might seem alarming. However, seasoned participants know that volatility is part of Bitcoin’s DNA. Let’s look at some historical patterns: Period Key Event/Trend Impact on Bitcoin Price 2017-2018 ICO Boom & Bust Massive bull run followed by a significant bear market (80%+ drop). 2020-2021 Pandemic & Institutional Adoption Explosive growth to new all-time highs, despite initial pandemic fears. 2022 Macroeconomic Headwinds & Crypto Events Bear market, major corrections amidst inflation and interest rate hikes. As the table illustrates, periods of significant price corrections are not new for Bitcoin. Each major downturn has historically been followed by a recovery and often new all-time highs. This pattern has led many to view these dips as opportunities rather than just setbacks, reinforcing the resilience of the Bitcoin price over the long term. What Does This Bitcoin Price Dip Mean for Investors? A dip in the Bitcoin price presents a dual perspective for investors: challenges and potential opportunities. Understanding both is key to making informed decisions. Challenges Increased Volatility: Short-term holders might face paper losses, leading to anxiety and potential panic selling. Uncertainty: Market dips can create uncertainty about the immediate future direction of the Bitcoin price , making it harder to plan. Liquidation Risks: For those trading with leverage, significant drops can trigger liquidations, leading to substantial losses. Opportunities Buying Opportunity: Many long-term investors view price corrections as a chance to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower cost, a strategy known as ‘buying the dip.’ Market Rebalancing: It can be an opportune time to re-evaluate portfolio allocations and adjust strategies based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Learning Experience: Volatility is a harsh but effective teacher. Each market movement offers insights into how global events and sentiment affect the Bitcoin price . Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility: Actionable Insights Given the inherent volatility, how can investors approach fluctuations in the Bitcoin price ? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Don’t rely solely on hype or fear. Long-Term Perspective: Consider Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Short-term price swings become less significant when viewed through a multi-year lens. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin to mitigate risk. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep up with reliable crypto news sources, but avoid constant market watching, which can lead to emotional decisions. These strategies are designed to help investors build resilience against market downturns and position themselves for potential future growth in the Bitcoin price . The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Price While the immediate drop below $118,000 might seem concerning, the long-term outlook for the Bitcoin price remains a subject of intense debate and optimism among many experts. Factors such as increasing institutional adoption, ongoing technological advancements (like the Lightning Network), and the growing global recognition of digital assets continue to underpin Bitcoin’s potential. Every dip is a test of market conviction, and Bitcoin has historically demonstrated remarkable resilience, often recovering stronger than before. In conclusion, the recent fall in the Bitcoin price below $118,000 is a snapshot of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It serves as a potent reminder of the importance of sound investment strategies, a long-term perspective, and continuous education. For those who understand its cycles, each dip, while challenging, can also present a strategic opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the Bitcoin price falls below a certain level? A1: When the Bitcoin price falls below a significant psychological or technical level, it often indicates a shift in market sentiment, potentially signaling increased selling pressure or a re-evaluation of its immediate value by traders. For investors, it can trigger concerns but also present opportunities to buy at a lower price. Q2: Is a Bitcoin price drop a sign of its failure? A2: Historically, no. Bitcoin has experienced numerous significant price drops throughout its existence, often recovering to reach new all-time highs. These dips are typically part of its market cycles and volatility, rather than a sign of inherent failure. Q3: How quickly can the Bitcoin price recover after a dip? A3: The recovery time for the Bitcoin price can vary greatly, ranging from days to months or even longer, depending on the underlying causes of the dip and broader market conditions. There’s no fixed timeline, as it’s influenced by various unpredictable factors. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if the price is falling? A4: Deciding whether to sell during a price fall depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Panic selling can lock in losses. Many long-term investors choose to hold or even buy more during dips, following a ‘buy the dip’ or dollar-cost averaging strategy. It’s crucial to consult with a financial advisor if you are unsure. Q5: What resources can help me understand Bitcoin price movements better? A5: Reliable cryptocurrency news outlets, market analysis platforms, reputable financial news sources, and educational resources focused on blockchain and digital assets can help you understand Bitcoin price movements better.

2025-07-21T12:12:38,"Robert Kiyosaki warns of potential bubble burst in Bitcoin, gold, and silver","Renowned financial educator and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has raised an alarm, warning investors about the growing risk of a simultaneous Bitcoin, gold, and silver price crash. Despite his long-term bullish stance on these assets, he now signals a strategic pause in buying and advises caution in the face of what he describes as an imminent economic correction. With Bitcoin recently surging past $120,000 to an all-time high, Kiyosaki believes the market may be entering dangerously inflated territory. A bubble ready to burst Kiyosaki’s latest statements highlight his concern that a broader economic bubble is on the verge of bursting. If that happens, he predicts it will not just impact traditional financial markets but also safe-haven and digital assets alike. Robert Kiyosaki has gone on record saying that when the global economy enters crisis mode, “odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too.” Robert Kiyosaki @theRealKiyosaki · Follow BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING.When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too.Good news.If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying.Take care. 5:52 AM · Jul 21, 2025 5.7K Reply Copy link Read 529 replies Although the author has consistently championed Bitcoin and precious metals as hedges against fiat currency devaluation, he acknowledges that no asset is immune to panic-driven selloffs. In his view, the key is not avoiding these assets, but knowing when to hold back and when to buy in aggressively during downturns. Strategic pause in buying after Bitcoin hit new ATH When Bitcoin crossed $117,000 earlier this month, Kiyosaki expressed excitement and said he would buy one more coin. However, as Bitcoin surpassed $120,000 shortly afterwards, he announced a change of course. He declared that he would pause any further purchases until there was more clarity about the economic direction. Kiyosaki emphasised that despite the potential of Bitcoin reaching $200,000 or even $1 million, now is not the time for greed. He referenced the saying, “pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered,” to warn against overexposure in a frothy market. For now, he prefers to wait for what he sees as an inevitable crash—after which he plans to buy more at discounted prices. Bitcoin dominance and market shifts While Bitcoin hit historic highs, its market dominance began to shrink. In just two weeks, its share of the total crypto market has dropped from 67% to 61%. During this period, altcoins like Ethereum and XRP gained traction , posting massive gains. This shift is largely attributed to growing investor appetite for diversification and increased risk tolerance. Additionally, gold has outpaced Bitcoin in 2025 so far, rising nearly 28% since the beginning of the year. While Bitcoin briefly overtook gold in performance, the balance quickly shifted back in favour of the precious metal. This back-and-forth has added another layer of complexity for investors deciding where to allocate capital in an uncertain economic climate. Cautious optimism for the long term Despite warning of a potential crash, Kiyosaki remains bullish on the long-term value of Bitcoin. Kiyosaki continues to project that the digital asset could reach $1 million in the future. However, he strongly advises newcomers to start small and educate themselves thoroughly before diving in. He even suggested that buying fractions of Bitcoin, satoshis, is a prudent first step. Kiyosaki also referenced Warren Buffett’s strategy of holding massive cash reserves, hinting that many smart investors may be waiting for distressed opportunities before entering the market again. In his words, the real winners will be those who buy after the “hogs” have been slaughtered and prices have crashed. While some may view Kiyosaki’s warnings as overly cautious or even contradictory, Kiyosaki’s evolving stance reflects the complexity and volatility of today’s markets. For traders and investors, the message is clear: stay informed, remain patient, and be ready to act when the tides inevitably turn.

2025-07-21T12:10:38,"Bitcoin Undervalued: PlanB Reveals the Explosive 10x Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Undervalued: PlanB Reveals the Explosive 10x Potential Is Bitcoin truly worth far more than its current price? Prominent analyst PlanB certainly thinks so, igniting a fervent discussion about why Bitcoin is undervalued by a staggering 10 times. This bold assertion isn’t just a casual remark; it stems from a deep dive into market dynamics, scarcity, and a comparison with traditional safe-haven assets like gold. For anyone navigating the exciting, yet often perplexing, world of cryptocurrencies, understanding this perspective is crucial. It challenges conventional thinking and invites us to consider Bitcoin’s potential through a different lens. Why is Bitcoin Undervalued According to PlanB? PlanB, widely recognized for his pioneering work on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model for Bitcoin, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his compelling analysis. His core argument revolves around a direct comparison between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold, two assets often pitted against each other as stores of value. At the heart of his thesis is a simple, yet profound, observation: gold’s colossal market capitalization dwarfs Bitcoin’s, despite Bitcoin possessing superior scarcity characteristics. Let’s break down PlanB’s primary points: Market Cap Disparity: Gold, a millennia-old store of wealth, boasts an approximate market capitalization of $20 trillion. In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around $2 trillion. This means gold is currently valued at ten times more than Bitcoin. Superior Scarcity: While gold is considered scarce, Bitcoin’s scarcity is demonstrably higher. PlanB highlights this through their respective Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratios. Gold’s S2F ratio is around 60, meaning it would take 60 years of current production to match the existing supply. Bitcoin, on the other hand, boasts an S2F ratio of 120, implying its new supply creation is half as much relative to its existing stock, making it twice as scarce as gold. Consider this side-by-side comparison: Asset Approximate Market Cap Stock-to-Flow Ratio (S2F) Scarcity Relative to Gold Gold $20 Trillion 60 1x Bitcoin (BTC) $2 Trillion 120 2x PlanB’s conclusion is straightforward: if Bitcoin is twice as scarce as gold, yet only commands one-tenth of its market value, then logically, Bitcoin is undervalued by at least a factor of ten. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s a quantitative assessment based on fundamental properties of both assets. Decoding the Bitcoin Undervalued Thesis: What Does This Mean for Investors? The assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued carries significant weight, particularly for those looking to understand its long-term investment potential. If PlanB’s analysis holds true, the implications for future price appreciation could be substantial. However, like any investment thesis, it comes with both promising benefits and important considerations. Potential Benefits for Investors: Significant Upside Potential: The most immediate benefit is the prospect of substantial returns. If Bitcoin were to close the valuation gap with gold, even partially, its price would see exponential growth from current levels. Reinforcement of the Digital Gold Narrative: PlanB’s comparison strengthens the argument that Bitcoin is a superior form of digital gold. Its verifiable scarcity, ease of transfer, and resistance to censorship make it an attractive alternative in an increasingly digital world. Long-Term Investment Horizon: This thesis encourages a long-term perspective. Rather than focusing on daily price fluctuations, investors are prompted to consider Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition over years, even decades. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its price volatility. While the long-term outlook might be bullish, short-term swings can be dramatic and challenging for many investors. Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could impact adoption and market sentiment. Adoption Rate: While growing, Bitcoin’s adoption as a global currency or widespread store of value is still nascent compared to gold. Its full potential hinges on broader acceptance and integration into financial systems. External Factors: Geopolitical events, technological advancements (or setbacks), and shifts in macroeconomic policy can all influence Bitcoin’s price independent of its intrinsic value. For investors, the actionable insight is not simply to buy Bitcoin because it’s deemed undervalued. Instead, it’s to use this analysis as a foundation for deeper research. Understanding the underlying reasons for its perceived undervaluation, alongside the inherent risks, allows for a more informed and strategic approach to portfolio allocation. The Scarcity Factor: How Does it Make Bitcoin Undervalued ? The concept of scarcity is fundamental to value, and it’s a cornerstone of why PlanB believes Bitcoin is undervalued . Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely, or even commodities like gold, which can be mined with new discoveries, Bitcoin’s supply is mathematically capped and predictable. This engineered scarcity is a critical differentiator. Here’s why Bitcoin’s scarcity is so potent: Fixed Supply Cap: There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins created. This absolute limit is hard-coded into its protocol, making it impossible to inflate the supply beyond this point. This contrasts sharply with gold, where new deposits can always be discovered, or fiat money, where central banks can increase supply at will. Halving Events: Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks (and thus, the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation) is cut in half. These “halving” events drastically reduce the new supply of Bitcoin, making it progressively scarcer over time. This predictable reduction in supply, combined with potentially increasing demand, is a powerful driver for value appreciation. Verifiable Scarcity: Unlike physical assets, where verifying the total supply can be challenging, Bitcoin’s supply is transparent and verifiable on its public blockchain. Anyone can audit the supply, ensuring trust in its scarcity. This unparalleled digital scarcity, coupled with its properties as a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and global asset, positions Bitcoin uniquely in the financial landscape. If scarcity is a primary driver of value for gold, and Bitcoin is demonstrably more scarce, then its current market valuation appears to lag significantly behind its fundamental properties. Beyond the Numbers: Broader Implications of Bitcoin Undervalued Status PlanB’s analysis, suggesting Bitcoin is undervalued , extends beyond mere market cap comparisons. It touches upon Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system and its potential as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. This broader perspective helps to contextualize why its current valuation might not fully reflect its long-term significance. A New Store of Value for the Digital Age: In an era of increasing digitization, Bitcoin offers a native digital store of value. It’s portable, divisible, and resistant to confiscation in ways physical assets are not. As the world becomes more digital, the demand for digital assets that embody sound money principles is likely to grow. Institutional Adoption and Mainstream Acceptance: While still in its early stages, institutional interest in Bitcoin is rapidly expanding. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure. As more institutions and corporations allocate capital to Bitcoin, its market capitalization is likely to expand, reflecting its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Hedge Against Inflation and Economic Instability: In a macroeconomic environment characterized by rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge. Its decentralized nature and limited supply offer an alternative to fiat currencies susceptible to debasement. Network Effect and Utility: Beyond its store of value proposition, Bitcoin’s network continues to grow in terms of users, developers, and infrastructure. The increasing utility of the Bitcoin network, including layers built on top of it, adds to its intrinsic value and potential for future growth. The journey for Bitcoin to potentially reach or surpass gold’s market cap is not without its hurdles. However, the foundational arguments, particularly those highlighting its superior scarcity and digital properties, make a compelling case for its long-term trajectory. The “undervalued” tag, as proposed by PlanB, serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s significant growth potential. In conclusion, PlanB’s assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued by at least 10 times is a powerful statement rooted in a meticulous comparison of market capitalization and scarcity with gold. By highlighting Bitcoin’s superior Stock-to-Flow ratio and fixed supply, he presents a compelling argument for its immense untapped potential. While the path to realizing this potential involves navigating market volatility and regulatory developments, the fundamental characteristics that make Bitcoin a unique digital asset remain strong. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this analysis provides a fresh perspective, encouraging a long-term view of Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a dominant global store of value. The question isn’t just if Bitcoin will rise, but how much its true value has yet to be unlocked. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is PlanB’s main argument for Bitcoin being undervalued? A1: PlanB argues that Bitcoin is undervalued primarily due to its significantly smaller market capitalization ($2 trillion) compared to gold ($20 trillion), despite Bitcoin possessing double the scarcity of gold, as indicated by its Stock-to-Flow ratio of 120 versus gold’s 60. He concludes that Bitcoin should be valued at least 10 times higher to reflect its superior scarcity. Q2: What is the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model? A2: The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model is a quantitative model used to predict the price of scarce assets like gold and Bitcoin. It measures the existing supply (stock) of an asset against the rate at which new supply is produced (flow). A higher S2F ratio indicates greater scarcity, which the model correlates with higher value. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s scarcity compare to gold’s? A3: Bitcoin is considered to be twice as scarce as gold according to PlanB’s analysis based on their Stock-to-Flow ratios. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and predictable halving events that reduce new supply, making its scarcity verifiable and absolute, unlike gold which can still be mined with new discoveries. Q4: What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin, even if it’s undervalued? A4: Despite the potential for being undervalued, investing in Bitcoin carries risks such as high price volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, potential for technological disruptions, and market sentiment shifts. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. Q5: Will Bitcoin reach gold’s market cap? A5: PlanB’s analysis suggests that based on scarcity, Bitcoin should theoretically be able to reach or even surpass gold’s market cap. However, achieving this depends on various factors including continued adoption, regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and its acceptance as a global store of value and medium of exchange. It’s a long-term prospect with no guarantees. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-21T12:10:00,"Best crypto for 2025? MUTM could deliver 1000% growth shortly","The next big winner in crypto might not come from a familiar name like BTC or ETH. Instead, eyes are turning toward a bold new player in the DeFi space— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Combining real-world use cases, stablecoin innovation, and a dual lending engine, MUTM is entering the final stages of its presale phase 5 at just $0.03, with over $12.7 million already raised. With more than 85% of tokens sold to 13,750+ holders, this final discounted phase is ending fast. The price is set to rise to $0.035 next, marking the last chance to enter before a wave of post-listing momentum. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, with each phase of the presale structured to reward early adoption. Momentum is growing rapidly, and analysts now consider this token one of the strongest breakout candidates for 2025. While most tokens rely solely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a foundation around sustainable yield, secure lending, and protocol-driven value flows. Stablecoin-driven lending meets real yield utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not following the usual playbook. The platform is constructing a decentralized borrowing system powered by a native stablecoin that only mints when overcollateralized loans are initiated. That means users will be able to lock bluechip crypto like ETH or BTC as collateral and mint stablecoins without selling their assets. Once loans are repaid—or liquidated if undercollateralized—the stablecoins are automatically burned. This system ensures the token remains tightly pegged to $1 while offering liquidity to holders without sacrificing long-term positions or triggering tax events. The peg will be maintained not only through strict overcollateralization and burning logic but also by dynamic interest rates set via protocol governance. When the stablecoin trades above $1, borrowing interest will drop to encourage supply. When it trades below $1, interest will increase to contract supply. This elegant balancing mechanism, combined with arbitrage opportunities, forms a sturdy foundation for the ecosystem. In addition, depositors receive mtTokens, which represent their share in lending pools and accrue interest. These mtTokens can be staked into dedicated smart contracts to earn rewards in MUTM tokens that will be bought back from the open market. This buyback system turns the protocol into a self-reinforcing flywheel, where token demand is fueled directly by platform revenue, adding another layer of yield for long-term holders. Flexible lending models for all investor types Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will support both P2C and P2P lending models, giving users a range of tools to suit their needs. The P2C model will be ideal for passive investors seeking predictable returns. A lender supplying 1,000 AVAX at a 70% loan-to-value ratio will be able to earn an 8% APY, accumulating 80 AVAX annually in interest. Smart contracts will manage the loan matching and execution, with mtTokens issued as proof of deposit. In contrast, the P2P system will enable direct agreements between lenders and borrowers, focusing on high-risk or speculative tokens. For instance, a user holding $6,000 worth of FLOKI will be able to access a $2,400 USDT loan with 30-day repayment terms, depending on lender preferences. This will unlock liquidity opportunities for holders of volatile meme or micro-cap coins—assets that are often ignored by traditional DeFi lenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also integrating Layer 2 blockchain architecture to eliminate congestion and reduce transaction costs. Users will experience fast settlement speeds and near-zero gas fees, making daily lending and borrowing practical and cost-effective. The roadmap is well-structured and includes four defined phases: the presale, smart contract development, beta launch, and full mainnet rollout. Each stage is being supported by institutional-grade security measures. The protocol has undergone a full audit by CertiK, scoring 95 in Token Scan and 77.5 on the Skynet system. Alongside this, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty is active to encourage external reviews, while a $100,000 token giveaway rewards community engagement. One leading crypto analyst—known for accurately predicting Solana’s 20x rally and XRP’s ETF-driven breakout—now projects that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reach $0.90 by Q4 2025. That’s a 30x gain from the current price and puts MUTM in line with some of the most legendary returns in the space. Whales who had previously sought shelter in Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) is now beginning to shift positions, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that MUTM will be the next magnet for capital rotation. The presale clock is ticking, and with the price set to jump from $0.03 to $0.035 in the next few days, this is the moment smart investors are acting.

2025-07-21T12:09:33,"Ether Machine to join the Nasdaq with $1.5 billion and 400,000 ETH for institutional yield","The Ether Machine is going live on the Nasdaq with more than $1.5 billion raised and 400,000 ETH locked in its vault. It’s the result of a reverse merger between The Ether Reserve, a crypto startup, and Dynamix Corp, a blank-check company that saw its shares more than double in premarket trading after the deal was made public, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The new entity will use the ticker ETHM, and is expected to begin trading before the end of 2025. Once this merger closes in the fourth quarter, Ether Machine will become the largest public vehicle giving institutions direct access to ETH , the world’s second-biggest crypto. That balance sheet play is the same exact game Michael Saylor ran with Strategy and Bitcoin, except now it’s Ethereum that’s getting the big-boy treatment. Kraken, Pantera and Blockchain.com pump $800 million into deal The capital behind this venture is loud and deep. Investors including Kraken, Pantera Capital, and Blockchain.com contributed over $800 million through an upsized common stock offering that padded the total raise beyond $1.6 billion. Running the show is Andrew Keys, the new chairman. He used to be an executive at ConsenSys, the Ethereum software company built by Joseph Lubin, one of Ethereum’s co-founders. Andrew’s appointment brings a face to the project that knows the Ethereum ecosystem inside-out. Over the last few months, a wave of crypto companies have been experimenting with similar strategies, public listings that let traditional finance bet on tokens through stocks. Most of those efforts have focused on Bitcoin, but ETH has been catching up fast. It just hit a seven-month high on Friday, as Cryptopolitan reported . Ethereum leads global crypto inflows as U.S. dominates market Right now, Ether is having its moment. Investment products tied to it just pulled in a record $2.12 billion in inflows, nearly double the previous high of $1.2 billion. That makes it the top-performing crypto by institutional interest over the past week. To be clear, Ether has now logged 13 straight weeks of inflows, accounting for 23% of its total assets under management. For 2025 alone, it has already brought in $6.2 billion, beating its entire 2024 total. Weekly crypto asset flow. Source: Coinshares Overall, last week logged $4.39 billion in inflows across all crypto investment products, beating the previous record of $4.27 billion, which happened just after the 2024 U.S. election. Those numbers mark the 14th straight week of gains, and bring this year’s total to $27 billion. Total assets under management now sit at $220 billion, another all-time high. The appetite is real. Most of that capital came from the U.S. , which saw $4.36 billion in inflows just this past week. Other regions also posted gains. Switzerland took in $47.3 million, Hong Kong added $14.1 million, and Australia followed with $17.3 million. Meanwhile, Brazil and Germany saw outflows of $28.1 million and $15.5 million. Bitcoin still brought in more overall this week, with $2.2 billion in inflows, but that’s a drop from $2.7 billion the week before. And unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin’s weekly exchange-traded product volumes now account for 55% of its total exchange volume. A big reason for ETH’s upswing is the improved regulatory tone in the U.S. around dollar-pegged stablecoins, which mostly operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Other tokens are getting attention too, but none are close to Ethereum’s numbers. Solana saw $39 million, XRP picked up $36 million, and Sui came in with $9.3 million in inflows.

2025-07-21T12:01:52,"Bitcoin Will Reach $140K in the Mid Term, but Will You Benefit? (Analyst)","Bitcoin (BTC) is flirting with $120,000 again, but there’s a growing tug-of-war between leveraged optimism and quiet spot distribution behind the scenes. This is according to pseudonymous analyst Mr. Wall Street, who warned on July 20 that while short-term momentum remains intact, BTC’s mid-term trajectory may be weakened as long-term holders start to cash out. Bull Case Amid Bearish Undercurrents In his assessment , Mr. Wall Street noted that the world’s number one cryptocurrency has secured its local bottom around $116,000, following a predicted pullback. He believes the asset will rise to between $120,000 and $123,500 in the short term, before a mid-term run pushes it towards the $133,000 to $140,000 range. However, the market watcher tempered his positive outlook with a critical on-chain observation: wallets that accumulated heavily at the $16,000 to $20,000 cycle lows in August 2022 have started offloading spot holdings, a pattern he says is eerily similar to what preceded the last cycle top. If that setup repeats, their selling this week could signal a potential market top forming by late October or early November. “It’s clear that these individuals know how to play this game,” noted the expert. “The fact they have already started to reduce the size of their own spot positions, after holding for three years, is a sign that they are anticipating a cycle top coming soon.” His assessment isn’t far from that shared by technical analyst CryptoVizArt, who cited CryptoQuant data showing that BTC reserves on centralized exchanges have risen to their highest since June 25. Historically, such increases often suggest growing sell-side pressure and typically come before local tops. “The market is getting weaker, regardless of what the charts are showing us,” warned Mr. Wall Street on X. Macro Crosswinds The immediate outlook still faces a few tests, including the July FOMC meeting, even though no rate cut is expected. According to Mr. Wall Street, markets are pricing in potential September cuts, which could fuel a pre-meeting pump followed by a “sell the news” event. Meanwhile, Bitcoin was trading at $119,269 at the time of this writing, up a slight 0.9% over 24 hours but down 2.9% over the past week. Additionally, it gained 9.4% over two weeks and 15.3% in the past 30 days, but remains 2.9% below its July 14 all-time high. The post Bitcoin Will Reach $140K in the Mid Term, but Will You Benefit?

2025-07-21T12:00:19,"Crypto Tax Cuts Could Unleash Bitcoin Buying Spree In Japan","Japan’s tough approach to crypto taxes is holding back both buyers and sellers. A survey of 1,500 adults in April found that just 13% currently own Bitcoin , Ethereum or other cryptoassets. Many say they’d be ready to dive in—if only Tokyo eased the tax burden. Majority Back Flat Tax According to the Japan Blockchain Association, 84% of the 191 people who already hold crypto would buy more if profits faced a flat 20% levy. And 12% of the 1,309 non‑holders said they’d start buying bitcoin or other cryptos under the same rule. That’s a big shift from today’s system, where crypto gains land under “other income” on tax returns. Right now, profits from bitcoin or crypto can be taxed at rates up to 55%, depending on your bracket. That’s far higher than the 10–20% flat rate that applies to stocks in many other countries. Based on reports, the JBA is pushing to move crypto into the same capital gains category, arguing it would boost trading volumes on local exchanges. Survey Shows Simple Rules Appeal Three quarters of survey participants said they’d rather have taxes withheld at the source when they sell bitcoins, instead of filing separate paperwork. The JBA has asked Tokyo to let traders choose whether to pay at the point of sale or when they file their annual return. That flexibility could ease headaches for both hobby investors and pros. The poll looked deeper into why some people still won’t touch crypto. Just 8% blamed high taxes, while 61% said they don’t feel they know enough about digital coins. The sample was 60% male and 40% female, with an average age of 38. Students made up 5.3% of the group, and 213 people said they were unemployed. FSA Considers Broader Reforms According to reports from the financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency is weighing a proposal to shift bitcoin under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved, that would officially treat digital assets as financial products—and could pave the way for a unified 20% tax by as early as next year. Exchanges like bitFlyer already see Ethereum trades account for almost half of their volume. Any change could reshape Japan’s crypto market—by making it simpler to trade, and by bringing more people into the fold.
