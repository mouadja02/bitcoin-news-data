2025-07-20T21:30:29,"Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2025?","With many traditional organizations, cryptocurrency exchanges, and individuals deeply entrenched in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem, the question of ‚Äúwho owns the most BTC?‚Äù has emerged. A close examination of Bitcoin‚Äôs ownership map in 2025 reveals a mix of concentration and quiet decentralization. Bitcoin Demonstrates Solid Footing This July, Bitcoin has proven to be resilient on multiple occasions, crossing several all-time highs (ATHs) in a week. This positive sentiment has also seeped into spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), with this class of investment recording massive inflows consistently . A significant drop in exchange-held reserves primarily backs the daily inflows into these spot ETFs. This outlook suggests rising investor confidence and long-term accumulation. At the time of this writing, the BTC price was $118,415.90, corresponding to a 0.5% increase over the last 24 hours. It is worth noting that Bitcoin has earlier surged to $123,000 before dropping to its current level. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Activity Much of the growth recorded by the coin this past week has been attributed to the¬†sudden movement of 20,000 BTC from two wallets from the Satoshi era. The stash, valued at over $2.1 billion, has remained untouched since 2011. This means that the¬†Bitcoin wallets have been dormant since that time. Upon resuming activity, they have transferred their funds to new, unidentified addresses. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham highlighted a recent transfer of $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin from eight wallets that had remained untouched since 2011. It noted that a technical reason may have been the driving force behind the activity. In the meantime, the reason for the sudden transfers remains unknown. However, these events of large dormant wallets waking up are another indicator of the highly concentrated distribution¬†of BTC power. Binance Leads on List of Top BTC Holders in 2025 Binance‚Äôs primary cold wallet, holding as much as 248,600 BTC, happens to top the list of top Bitcoin holders in 2025. This represents approximately 1.25% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total circulating supply and is valued at over $26 billion. Robinhood‚Äôs cold wallet, containing approximately 140,600 BTC worth roughly $15 billion, is next in line after Binance. Following closely is Bitfinex‚Äôs cold wallet, which stores about 130,010 BTC, although it is expected to hold more if not for some minor fluctuations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, recently climbed to the 11th spot among the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals.
