2025-07-20T23:30:00,"Japanese Would Buy More BTC if Gov‚Äôt Made Crypto Tax Reforms ‚Äì Survey","Most Japanese say they would buy more Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and altcoins if the government agrees to reform the nation‚Äôs strict crypto tax rules. This was the main takeaway from a survey of 1,500 adults conducted in April and commissioned by the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) . Japanese Crypto Tax Reforms Would Drive Volumes Up, Says JBA In response to the question: ‚ÄúDo you own BTC or other cryptoassets?‚Äù 13% of respondents responded in the affirmative.

(Source: TV Tokyo Biz/YouTube/Screenshot) However, their response to the follow-up question was telling. The question was: ‚ÄúWould you buy crypto/more crypto if the government were to set a flat 20% tax rate on crypto profits?‚Äù To this, 84% of the 191 respondents who said they hold crypto answered ‚Äúyes.‚Äù And 12% of the 1,309 non-crypto holders also agreed that they would start buying coins if Tokyo green-lights tax reforms.

At present, Japanese investors must declare their crypto-related profits on income tax returns, in the ‚Äúother income‚Äù category. That means that depending on their tax brackets, crypto investors may have to pay taxes of up to 55% on their profits. In many other nations, crypto is instead subject to capital gains tax. That means that, after a certain threshold, traders are taxed at a flat rate of (typically) 10-20%. The Japanese Cabinet headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. (Source: Mytho88 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Reform advocates want Tokyo to approve a plan to scrap crypto income tax laws. In their place, they want a flat 20% capital gains levy. The JBA supports this proposal, as do many key members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in addition to opposition lawmakers. However, the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) effectively has the final say on all Japanese crypto policy. Thus far, all of the FSA recommendations to the Cabinet have been enshrined into law. The association said: ‚ÄúCryptoassets are changing from a means of payment for the public to a means of asset accumulation.‚Äù This is in line with the FSA‚Äôs own plans to reclassify crypto as a payment tool to an investment vehicle. The industry body says it is ‚Äústepping up its efforts‚Äù to convince Tokyo to approve tax reform starting next year. The JBA is an industry group that comprises some of the nation‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges and blockchain firms. JBA Submits Petition The association also announced on July 18 that it has submitted a petition to the FSA calling for it to approve tax reform for crypto profits. The survey was conducted on April 24 and April 25 this year. Respondents were all Japanese residents aged 20 to 69. Respondents were 60% male and 40% female, with an average age of 38. The JBA also asked further questions. And 75% of respondents said they would prefer tax bodies to withdraw their payable taxes at source, rather than make separate tax declarations. The JBA has also asked Tokyo to let crypto traders choose how they want to pay taxes: at source when they sell coins, or after filing declarations. The survey‚Äôs authors also asked the respondents who do not currently hold any coins why they have not invested yet. To this, 8% of respondents said that they thought that tax levels were too high. But 61% said they thought they lacked sufficient understanding of crypto. The Japanese media outlet CoinPost reported that the FSA is now ‚Äúdeliberating a proposal to transition cryptoassets to the framework of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the transition is approved, cryptoassets will be officially classified as financial products,‚Äù the media outlet explained. Most of the respondents said they work in the private sector. Students made up 5.3% of the respondent pool. And 213 unemployed individuals also submitted responses. At the time of writing, ETH trading accounts for almost half of the trading volume on bitFlyer, one of the nation‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges.

2025-07-20T23:25:28,"Pension Fund Bitcoin: Ohio‚Äôs Monumental Leap into Digital Assets","BitcoinWorld Pension Fund Bitcoin: Ohio‚Äôs Monumental Leap into Digital Assets The financial world is buzzing with news that could signal a monumental shift in how large institutions view digital assets. If you‚Äôve been following the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, you‚Äôre likely aware of the growing interest from corporations and high-net-worth individuals. But what happens when one of the nation‚Äôs largest public pension funds makes a significant move into the crypto space? The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), a financial behemoth managing the retirement savings for hundreds of thousands of Ohio‚Äôs public servants, has just done exactly that, increasing its pension fund Bitcoin exposure through a strategic investment. This isn‚Äôt just a minor allocation; it‚Äôs a clear signal that even the most conservative investment vehicles are beginning to recognize the potential of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ohio‚Äôs Pension Fund Bitcoin Bet: What Exactly Happened? In a move that has captured headlines across the financial sector, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) significantly bolstered its stake in a prominent Bitcoin investment firm during the second quarter. This isn‚Äôt a small fund; OPERS stands as the largest public pension fund in Ohio and ranks as the 11th-largest in the entire United States, overseeing a vast portfolio. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was also cited by Barron‚Äôs, OPERS acquired an additional 21,499 shares in ‚ÄúStrategy,‚Äù widely understood to be MicroStrategy (MSTR), a publicly traded company known for its substantial corporate Bitcoin holdings and its strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin over time. This latest purchase brings OPERS‚Äô total stake in MicroStrategy to an impressive 101,880 shares. This increased allocation highlights a growing comfort level among large institutional investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin, even as direct investment options for pension funds remain complex. Why Are Pension Funds Looking at Bitcoin? The decision by OPERS to deepen its pension fund Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy raises an important question: what‚Äôs driving this trend among traditionally conservative entities? Pension funds, by their very nature, prioritize long-term stability and consistent returns to meet their future liabilities. For years, digital assets like Bitcoin were largely considered too volatile or speculative for such portfolios. However, several factors are now shifting this perspective: Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns on the rise, many investors are seeking assets that can preserve purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Diversification Benefits: Traditional portfolios often rely on a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation with traditional asset classes, particularly during certain market cycles, can offer valuable diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while enhancing returns. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated unparalleled growth over the past decade. Institutional investors, with their long-term horizons, may be looking to capture a portion of this potential future appreciation as digital assets mature and gain wider adoption. Accessibility through Public Companies: Investing in companies like MicroStrategy provides an indirect, regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This method offers a level of familiarity and oversight that aligns more closely with pension fund investment mandates. The Growing Trend: Institutional Adoption of Digital Assets OPERS‚Äô move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant piece of a larger puzzle: the accelerating institutional adoption of digital assets. While the journey has been gradual, a clear trend is emerging where more and more sophisticated investors, including endowments, family offices, and now public pension funds, are exploring or actively investing in the crypto space. This shift is being driven by several key developments: Improved Regulatory Clarity: Although still evolving, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is slowly becoming clearer in various jurisdictions, making institutional participation less ambiguous. Enhanced Custodial Solutions: The availability of secure, institutional-grade custody solutions for digital assets has addressed one of the primary concerns for large funds ‚Äì the safe storage of these novel assets. Increased Market Infrastructure: The growth of regulated exchanges, futures markets, and other financial products built around cryptocurrencies provides more robust and familiar avenues for institutional engagement. Peer Influence: As more prominent institutions make their foray into digital assets, it often creates a ‚Äúdomino effect,‚Äù encouraging others to conduct their due diligence and consider similar allocations to avoid being left behind. This evolving landscape suggests that what was once considered a niche, speculative asset class is steadily moving towards mainstream acceptance within the institutional investment community. The increased pension fund Bitcoin exposure by OPERS is a powerful testament to this ongoing transformation. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Pension Fund Bitcoin Investments While the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and other digital assets are compelling, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges that pension funds, and indeed all institutional investors, face when considering such investments. Volatility remains a primary concern. Bitcoin‚Äôs price swings can be dramatic, potentially impacting short-term portfolio performance. Regulatory uncertainty, though improving, still presents hurdles, particularly concerning tax implications and future legal frameworks for digital assets. Furthermore, the nascent nature of the crypto market means that traditional valuation models may not always apply directly, requiring new approaches to due diligence. However, the long-term outlook for pension fund Bitcoin investments appears increasingly positive as the market matures. As more institutional capital flows into the space, liquidity is likely to improve, and volatility may gradually moderate. The development of more sophisticated financial products, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, could also provide simpler and more regulated avenues for pension funds to gain direct exposure in the future, bypassing the need for indirect investments through companies like MicroStrategy. This evolution signifies a broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial system, potentially unlocking new avenues for growth and diversification for long-term investors. The move by OPERS underscores a growing conviction among large, long-term investors that digital assets, led by Bitcoin, are here to stay and represent a legitimate asset class deserving of allocation. This isn‚Äôt merely a speculative gamble; it‚Äôs a strategic decision informed by evolving market dynamics and a forward-looking perspective on portfolio construction. As the digital asset space continues to mature, we can expect to see more pension funds and similar institutions follow suit, gradually integrating these innovative assets into their diversified portfolios. The future of finance is clearly embracing the digital frontier, and pension fund Bitcoin adoption is a key indicator of this transformative journey.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is OPERS and why is their investment in Bitcoin significant? A1: OPERS stands for the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System. It is the largest public pension fund in Ohio and the 11th-largest in the U.S. Their investment in Bitcoin, specifically by increasing their stake in MicroStrategy, is significant because it signals a growing acceptance and strategic allocation of digital assets by traditionally conservative, large institutional investors. Q2: How did OPERS invest in Bitcoin? Did they buy Bitcoin directly? A2: OPERS did not buy Bitcoin directly. Instead, they increased their holdings in MicroStrategy (MSTR), a publicly traded company that holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This provides OPERS with indirect exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated equity investment. Q3: What are the primary reasons a pension fund might invest in Bitcoin? A3: Pension funds might consider investing in Bitcoin for several reasons, including its potential as an inflation hedge, its diversification benefits due to low correlation with traditional assets, and its long-term growth potential. Investing through publicly traded companies like MicroStrategy also offers a familiar and regulated pathway. Q4: What are the risks associated with pension funds investing in Bitcoin? A4: The primary risks include Bitcoin‚Äôs high price volatility, which can impact portfolio performance, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space. Additionally, the nascent nature of the market means that traditional valuation models may need adaptation. Q5: Is this a common trend among other pension funds in the U.S.? A5: While still not widespread, there is a growing trend among institutional investors, including some endowments and family offices, to explore or invest in digital assets. OPERS‚Äô move is a notable example, and it suggests that more pension funds may follow suit as the market matures and regulatory clarity improves. Q6: How does this investment align with a pension fund‚Äôs long-term strategy? A6: For pension funds, long-term strategy focuses on stable returns and capital preservation. Investing in Bitcoin, even indirectly, aligns with this by seeking diversification, potential inflation protection, and exposure to a high-growth asset class that could enhance returns over a multi-decade horizon, provided the risks are appropriately managed.
