2025-07-21T19:55:31,"Ethereum Leads Record $4,390,000,000 Inflows to Institutional Crypto Products: CoinShares","Ethereum ( ETH ) “stole the show” for institutional investments into digital asset products last week, reports crypto investment firm CoinShares. According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Report, institutional digital asset investors poured record amounts into ETH exchange-traded products (ETPs) last week. “Ethereum stole the show, attracting a record US$2.12bn in inflows, nearly double its previous record of US$1.2bn. The past 13 weeks of inflows now represent 23% of Ethereum AuM (assets under management), with 2025 inflows already exceeding the full-year total for 2024 at US$6.2bn.” Bitcoin ( BTC ) products also enjoyed huge inflows of $2.2 billion. Meanwhile, Solana ( SOL ), XRP , and SUI exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced inflows of $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively. Overall, all of this added up to the largest weekly inflows on record for digital asset investment products. “Digital asset investment products recorded their largest weekly inflows on record, totalling US$4.39bn, surpassing the previous peak of US$4.27bn set post-US election in December 2024. This marks the 14th consecutive week of inflows, bringing year-to-date (YTD) totals to US$27bn, while total assets under management hit a new all-time high of US$220bn. Weekly trading turnover in ETPs also reached record levels globally, hitting US$39.2bn, driven by elevated volumes in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.” Source: CoinShares The US led inflows globally at $4.36 billion. Although Brazil and Germany saw outflows of $28.1 million and $15.5 million, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Australia provided additional inflows of $47.3 million, $14.1 million, and $17.3 million, respectively.

2025-07-21T19:55:23,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Sudden Plunge Below $117,000 Shocks Investors","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Sudden Plunge Below $117,000 Shocks Investors The cryptocurrency world is once again buzzing with activity, as the much-watched Bitcoin price drop has sent ripples across the market. In a swift turn of events, BTC, the undisputed king of digital assets, has fallen below the significant $117,000 mark. This sudden movement has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just beginning your crypto journey, understanding the dynamics behind such a shift is crucial for navigating the often-unpredictable digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, a trusted source for cryptocurrency insights, a significant Bitcoin price drop has been observed. BTC is currently trading at $116,953.77 on the Binance USDT market. This specific figure highlights a notable dip from recent highs, signaling a moment of caution for many market participants. Such precise data points are vital for traders and long-term holders alike, as they provide an immediate snapshot of market sentiment and momentum. A decline of this nature, particularly when a key psychological level like $117,000 is breached, can trigger a cascade of reactions across the broader crypto ecosystem. While the immediate cause might appear singular, the underlying forces are often complex, reflecting a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, investor behavior, and technical trading signals. It’s important to remember that volatility is a characteristic feature of the crypto market, and a Bitcoin price drop , while unsettling, is not an uncommon occurrence in its history. What Factors Influence a Bitcoin Price Drop? A significant Bitcoin price drop is rarely an isolated event, stemming from a single cause. Instead, it typically arises from a combination of interconnected factors, each playing a role in shaping market sentiment and liquidity. Understanding these elements is paramount for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Here are some of the key drivers that frequently contribute to a downturn in Bitcoin’s value: Macroeconomic Trends: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and recession fears, can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors may pull capital from riskier ventures, leading to a Bitcoin price drop . Regulatory News and Crackdowns: Announcements of new regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny from governments worldwide can create uncertainty and fear within the crypto community. Countries implementing stricter rules on mining, trading, or stablecoins can trigger sell-offs as investors react to potential future limitations or compliance burdens. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly influence market prices. A major sale by a whale can flood the market with supply, pushing prices down. Conversely, large purchases can drive prices up. Monitoring significant on-chain movements can sometimes provide early indicators of potential shifts. Technical Analysis Signals: Traders often rely on technical indicators and chart patterns. When Bitcoin breaks below crucial support levels, like the $117,000 mark in this instance, it can trigger automated sell orders and panic selling among those who follow technical analysis, exacerbating a Bitcoin price drop . Global Events and Geopolitical Tensions: Major international events, such as conflicts, pandemics, or significant political shifts, can lead to widespread market instability. In times of global uncertainty, investors often seek safety in traditional assets, diverting funds away from cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment and FUD: “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt” (FUD) can spread rapidly through social media and news cycles. Negative narratives, even if unfounded, can lead to a collective loss of confidence, prompting widespread selling and contributing to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities During a Significant BTC Price Fall While a Bitcoin price drop can certainly be unsettling, particularly for those with substantial holdings, it’s essential to recognize that such periods also present both challenges and unique opportunities. The immediate reaction for many is often emotional, leading to hasty decisions that might not align with their long-term investment goals. The primary challenges include: Emotional Impact and Panic Selling: The sight of a declining portfolio can trigger fear, leading some investors to sell their assets at a loss, often at the worst possible time. This emotional response can lock in losses that might otherwise recover. Liquidation Risks for Leveraged Positions: Traders using leverage are particularly vulnerable during a sharp Bitcoin price drop . If the price falls below their liquidation threshold, their positions are automatically closed, resulting in significant losses. Increased Uncertainty: Downturns create an environment of uncertainty, making it difficult to predict when the market will stabilize or reverse course. This can lead to investor paralysis or poor decision-making. However, for those who maintain a strategic perspective, a Bitcoin price drop can also unveil opportunities: “Buying the Dip”: Experienced investors often view price corrections as opportunities to acquire more Bitcoin at a lower cost, adhering to the principle of “buy low, sell high.” Portfolio Rebalancing: A market dip can be an opportune time to reassess and rebalance one’s portfolio, adjusting allocations to align with long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance. Actionable Insights for Investors During a Bitcoin Price Drop When confronted with a significant Bitcoin price drop , making informed and rational decisions is paramount. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider these actionable strategies to protect your investments and potentially capitalize on market shifts: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any moves, thoroughly research the current market conditions, news, and expert analyses. Rely on credible sources and avoid acting solely on speculative rumors. Avoid Panic Selling: Resist the urge to sell all your holdings in fear. Historically, markets tend to recover, and panic selling often locks in losses. Unless your financial situation demands it, consider holding through the volatility. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. When the price is low, your fixed investment buys more units, averaging down your cost basis over time. DCA helps mitigate the risk of investing a large sum at a market peak, making a Bitcoin price drop less impactful on your overall average. Review Your Portfolio and Risk Tolerance: Use this period to reassess your overall investment strategy. Are your allocations still aligned with your risk tolerance? Do you have sufficient emergency funds outside of crypto? Adjust your portfolio as needed. Stay Informed and Skeptical: Continuously follow reliable cryptocurrency news outlets and market analysts. However, maintain a healthy skepticism towards sensational headlines and unverified claims. Focus on data-driven insights. Set Stop-Loss Orders (for active traders): If you are an active trader, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses by automatically selling your assets if they fall to a predetermined price. This is a risk management tool, not a guarantee against all losses. The Broader Implications: Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Drop The recent Bitcoin price drop is not merely a movement in a single asset’s value; it often serves as a barometer for the wider digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin’s dominant market capitalization means its price movements can send ripples across various segments of the crypto world, influencing altcoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and even the burgeoning non-fungible token (NFT) market. When Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn, altcoins, which often follow BTC’s lead, typically see even larger percentage declines. This correlation is due to Bitcoin’s role as the primary liquidity pair for many altcoins and its status as the market’s bellwether. Furthermore, a decline in BTC’s value can impact the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, potentially affecting lending rates and the stability of various decentralized applications. Overall investor confidence can also wane, leading to reduced trading volumes and a more cautious approach across the entire crypto space. A Look Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin After This Price Drop? Predicting the exact future trajectory after a Bitcoin price drop is inherently challenging, given the market’s notorious volatility and susceptibility to external factors. However, analysts often look at key support and resistance levels, on-chain data, and macroeconomic indicators to form projections and identify potential scenarios. A rebound could be triggered by positive news, such as institutional adoption, favorable regulatory clarity, or a general improvement in global economic conditions. Conversely, further declines could occur if negative macroeconomic data persists, or if major market participants engage in further selling. For long-term investors, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition—its decentralized nature, scarcity, and growing network effects—often outweighs short-term price fluctuations. The market’s resilience has been tested many times before, and each Bitcoin price drop , while challenging, has historically paved the way for future growth. Conclusion: Remaining Resilient Amidst Market Fluctuations The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be alarming, they are also an integral part of the market’s maturation and cyclical behavior. For investors, the key lies in maintaining a clear, well-researched strategy, staying informed through reliable sources, and exercising patience. Understanding that market corrections are a natural part of any investment landscape can help mitigate emotional responses and lead to more rational decision-making. Whether you are a seasoned trader or new to the space, adopting a resilient mindset and focusing on long-term objectives will be crucial for navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when BTC falls below a certain price like $117,000? A1: When Bitcoin falls below a significant price level, especially one that has acted as support in the past, it often indicates a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. It can trigger further selling as technical traders react to the breach of a key support level, and it signifies increased supply or decreased demand at that price point. Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A2: A single Bitcoin price drop below a specific level doesn’t definitively signal a bear market, which is typically characterized by a prolonged period of declining prices (e.g., 20% or more from recent highs) and negative sentiment. However, it can be an indicator of increasing bearish pressure and warrants close monitoring of broader market trends and technical indicators. Q3: How can I protect my investments during a BTC price fall? A3: To protect your investments during a Bitcoin price drop , consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders (if actively trading), diversifying your portfolio, and avoiding emotional panic selling. It’s also crucial to only invest what you can afford to lose and maintain a long-term perspective. Q4: What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), and how does it help during a price drop? A4: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly) regardless of the asset’s price. During a Bitcoin price drop , DCA allows you to buy more Bitcoin units for the same fixed investment, effectively lowering your average purchase price over time and reducing the impact of short-term volatility. Q5: Where can I get reliable information about Bitcoin market trends? A5: For reliable information on Bitcoin market trends, consult reputable financial news outlets, established crypto analytics platforms, and official reports from market monitoring firms. Websites like Bitcoin World, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and analyses from well-known financial institutions often provide accurate and timely data. Q6: Will Bitcoin recover from this price drop? A6: Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant price drops and reaching new all-time highs over the long term. While past performance is not indicative of future results, many analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects due to its fundamental characteristics and growing adoption. Recovery depends on various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader economic conditions.

2025-07-21T19:45:30,"Calamos Investments to Bring Laddered ETFs To Bitcoin","Calamos’ Structured Protection ETF suite provides financial advisors and investors with monthly entry points to capital-protected growth strategies that offer exposure to Bitcoin over one-year outcome periods. The landmark product is one of the long line of past, present, and upcoming ETFs, focused on the leading asset. Diversifying Exposure Calamos Investments, an investment manager with over $40 billion in assets under management (AUM), filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week for three separate exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Calamos Laddered Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOY) – designed to match the positive (spot) price return of Bitcoin up to a defined cap while protecting against 100% of losses over one year (before fees and expenses). Laddered Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTY) – as CBOY, matches the positive (spot) price return up to a cap, whilst limiting maximum losses to 20%, over one year, before fees. Even if BTC’s price falls more than 20%, the ETF structure will not allow investors to lose more than 20% of their investment during the outcome period. Laddered Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXY) – as CBTY, but the loss protection is 10%. This would be the latest addition to the ETFs the company offers specifically for Bitcoin, with each one delivering fluctuating levels of downside protection. “Providing exposure to Bitcoin with limits on losses (and upside) can appeal to financial advisors and investors who have been interested in crypto, but leery of the volatility,” noted Matt Kaufman, head of ETFs at Calamos.“The financial advisory community hasn’t broadly adopted Bitcoin or crypto,” he said. “This creates a bridge into Bitcoin for people who otherwise wouldn’t approach it.” The funds will utilize options and have exposure to the prices of up to five ETFs, which also happen to be the ones with the highest amounts of AUM, as of the time of writing, according to data from CoinGlass. The tracked prices will be from the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with over $86 billion in assets under management, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), $4 billion AUM, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), $4.8B AUM, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $21 billion in managed assets, and Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) – $6 billion in AUM. The funds are “laddered,” meaning they are invested in a BTC ETF with varying outcome periods, which brings diversification through exposure to different Bitcoin ETFs over time, as per the prospectuses. Kaufman went further by elaborating that risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio can be altered, which could be enticing to investors, driving them to allocate more than 1% or 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, exceeding the general asset manager recommendation. “That may also be the case for early-stage crypto investors, whose wealth has grown exponentially, and who now want to reduce risk and trade pure Bitcoin holdings for ETFs.” An ETF Boom It appears that the institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF products remains insatiable. As CryptoPotato reported last week, such funds experienced a $7.78 billion inflow streak over 7 days. Moreover, BlackRock’s fund, IBIT, generated more revenue than the one tracking the S&P 500, despite being active for only about 1.5 years. It is also worthwhile to note that majority-owned by the U.S. President, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), filed for a Bitcoin ETF just last month.

2025-07-21T19:30:43,"Shiba Inu Exec Outlines How Altcoin Season Will Go, And How SHIB Will Perform","A Shiba Inu executive has outlined the expected path of the upcoming altcoin season , detailing how capital could rotate through the market and where the SHIB token fits into the cycle. The report breaks down the typical stages of altcoin season and highlights how the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT, is positioned to benefit. Shiba Inu Exec Shares Altcoin Season And SHIB Roadmap In a recent report published on X social media, Shiba Inu’s head of marketing, Lucie, presented a detailed roadmap of how the next altcoin season is set to unfold , along with a clear vision for SHIB’s expected performance throughout the cycle. According to Lucie, the process begins with Bitcoin leading the charge by breaking key resistance levels and regaining market dominance . Once BTC’s rally establishes a solid foothold, Ethereum typically follows , serving as the signal that capital is beginning to rotate into the broader altcoin market. At that point, top high-cap altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and others usually start gaining strong momentum. Once this happens, Shiba Inu is expected to enter the spotlight, with renewed interest being driven by the growing adoption and utility of Shibarium, the meme project’s layer-2 blockchain. Shibarium , powered by the BONE token as its native gas asset, offers real network utility and is seen by Lucie as a foundational component for Shiba Inu’s rise in the coming months. The marketing lead has also highlighted the return of LEASH, another Shiba Inu ecosystem token . She calls the coin a “sleeper underdog” that could see a resurgence as market attention intensifies. TREAT , the ecosystem’s upcoming reward and AI-integrated token , is also set to play a key role by bridging technological innovation with community incentives and decentralized finance rollouts. What Happens Next As Altcoin Season Unfolds Beyond the Shiba Inu ecosystem , Lucie laid out the typical phases of a standard altcoin season. As capital flows from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins, mid and low-cap tokens often experience explosive rallies. The marketing lead revealed that these tokens could post gains of 5x to 100x as investors chase outsized returns. At the same time, meme coins tend to “moon,” propelled by social media hype and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) from retail investors . Lucie disclosed that this surge in activity may lead to a spike in gas fees , especially on the Ethereum network, as transaction volume soars. However, the influx of new retail participants could lead to a rise in rug pulls , scam tokens, and fake projects that prey on inexperienced investors. As hype builds, the Shiba Inu executive notes that smart money could begin taking profits, creating exit liquidity as the latecomers rush in. Amid all the noise, Lucie emphasizes that SHIB will remain committed to development and ecosystem growth . Essentially, while the market follows its familiar pattern of euphoria and subsequent correction, Shiba Inu will reportedly continue building, anchored by its expanding utility, token ecosystem, and long-term vision.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exec-on-altcoin-season/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI","Shiba Inu|Altcoin Season|altcoins|bitcoin|BONE|Ethereum|fear of missing out|fomo|LEASH|Lucie|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu ecosystem|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|solana|TREAT",cryptocompare
2025-07-21T19:23:57,"Institutions Are Driving Ethereum's 'Comeback'","For a year, Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, has lived in the shadows of its competitors, as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and solana jumped in price and dominated the conversation. Amid criticism from investors and some community members, ETH languished at levels below $1500 as recently as April. But on Monday ETH was near $3800, up 13% year-to-date, and analysts pointed to numerous signs of a turning point for the project. Some have pointed out that the momentum of the ecosystem has returned partially thanks to the explosion of stablecoins and tokenization on Ethereum. “For institutions looking to get exposure, Ethereum is the primary on-chain option, leading in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization with $7.8 billion in tokenized assets, or nearly 60% of the total RWA market cap,” said Jake Koch-Gollup, a research analyst at Messari, to CoinDesk. As of the beginning of July 2025, Whales with addresses that hold between 1,000-10,000 in ETH have increased their holdings of the token, according to data from Glassnode. Collectively they hold about 14 million ETH units, up from roughly 12 million at the end of 2024. Vivek Raman, who founded Etherealize and spends his time speaking with institutions to market ETH as an asset class, believes that ETH should be seen like BTC as “a store of value,"" comparing it to “ digital oil .” The layer-2 ecosystem, which are auxiliary blockchains atop of Ethereum used to transact for faster and cheaper, have appeared en masse over the past few years, and institutions have started to also build with them. JP Morgan recently announced they launched a proof-of-concept for tokenizing their deposits on Coinbase’s Base chain, while Robinhood, the retail trading giant, shared its plans to build its own layer-2 with the Arbitrum stack. If it works, it could bring Ethereum’s technology to an even broader mainstream audience and deepen its position as the backbone for a new generation of financial applications. Some believe layer-2 networks were taking away value from the Ethereum base layer and making user experience more disconnected , but Raman argues that institutions view them differently. According to Raman, the customizability of a layer-2 network is a plus for these institutions. “You can be a landlord and get access to the liquidity of Ethereum,” said Raman in an interview. “So the validation of the L2 ecosystem is now pretty undeniable.” Koch-Gollup, at Messari, believes that protocol changes that enhance the scaling of Ethereum as a base layer will position the network well for the future. “A 100-1,000x throughput jump collapses gas fees, reopens the space for consumer-grade apps, and refutes the “L2s are eating the L1” narrative,” he said. “Concurrently, bigger blocks and more activity feed back into base-fee burn, tightening ETH’s supply during periods of high demand.” Ethereum is also benefitting from the corporate treasury trend, with a growing number of companies adopting ETH as a strategic treasury asset. That is, not just for holding, but for staking to generate yield, signaling a shift from traditional treasury strategies, often limited to cash or bitcoin, to one that leverages Ethereum’s staking rewards, programmability, and integration into DeFi and stablecoin ecosystems. SharpLink Gaming, a NASDAQ-listed sports betting firm, BitMine, and BitDigital, both crypto mining firms, have all shifted their crypto treasury strategies to this. “SharpLink Gaming (SBET) saw its stock price [rise 412%] after announcing its ETH treasury strategy, showing there’s a clear market appetite for publicly traded companies holding ETH on their balance sheets,” Koch-Gollup told CoinDesk. The company is chaired by Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum. BitMine, which recently saw Wall Street personality Tom Lee join, also shared that it holds over 300,000 ETH in its treasury. “Collectively, these trends suggest a deeper institutional re-rating of Ethereum, not just as infrastructure, but as a yield-bearing, balance-sheet-worthy asset and a directional bet on the future of on-chain finance,” Koch-Gollup said.

2025-07-21T19:21:03,"Altcoin Season Indicators: Ethereum Rockets 21%, XRP Hits ATH as Bitcoin Dominance Wanes","Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to slip as capital flows into a broader set of digital assets. From Ethereum’s sharp breakout to the resurgence of meme coins, the market has entered a phase of visible diversification. This raises a familiar question: Is an altcoin season underway? While the term often generates hype, verifying its arrival requires more than anecdotal gains. This analysis examines current price action, dominance metrics, and altcoin season indicators to assess whether the shift is technical noise or the beginning of a deeper rotation. Performance Snapshot: Ethereum, XRP, and Meme Tokens Ethereum surged from under $3,100 to over $3,750 in the first three weeks of July 2025, according to CoinMarketCap. The move coincided with a wave of liquidations and rising ETH inflows, especially into derivatives platforms. Market watchers tied the rally to anticipation around scaling upgrades and ETH’s improving market share. #Crypto market is up today, the market cap has surpassed $4 trillion, #BTC is back above $120,350, #ETH is nearing $4,000, and ETH spot #ETFs saw the second-highest inflows yet. https://t.co/j23H5XZsPn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 XRP outperformed even more dramatically. On July 17, it breached its previous all-time high, touching $3.49 before retreating slightly. CoinMarketCap data confirms this level marked a new price discovery zone, aided by regulatory clarity in Asia and adoption by financial services platforms. It is currently trading at $3.61. DOGE also participated in the rally. While not reaching new highs, it climbed nearly 40% in a two-week window, driven by retail enthusiasm and Elon Musk’s renewed social mentions. This broader participation suggests the rally was not limited to high-cap utility tokens alone. Interpreting the Climb with Altcoin Season Index As of July 21, the Altcoin Season Index— tracked by Blockchaincenter —stands at 59. This index measures the number of top 50 coins outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While 75 is the official “altcoin season” threshold, the current level marks a steep climb from 28 in early June. It shows a shift in relative strength, especially when paired with falling Bitcoin dominance. The trend is clear, even if the season isn’t official yet. CMC Altcoin Season Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Similarly, the CMC Altcoin Season Index tracks the performance of 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin for the past 90 days and is currently showing a reading of 56. Bitcoin Dominance and Capital Migration Bitcoin dominance dropped to 60.49% this week, its lowest level since March, according to TradingView’s BTC.D chart . The decline mirrors the expanding inflows into Ethereum, meme assets, and select infrastructure tokens. Historically, BTC.D falling below 50% has marked a transition toward broader risk appetite. ETH’s share of total market cap rose 1.5% in July, while DeFi tokens like AAVE and UNI posted double-digit weekly gains. These shifts show a familiar pattern: capital exits Bitcoin for potentially higher-yield altcoins when market sentiment turns risk-on. That behavior is now repeating, albeit more selectively than in prior cycles. Infrastructure Tokens and the Flight to Utility Analysts are flagging a parallel theme beneath the meme hype: a rotation into infrastructure plays with perceived longevity. Chainlink (LINK) , trading around $19, is attracting institutional interest again. LINK’s cross-chain interoperability could be seen as essential to upcoming RWAs and enterprise integrations. Cardano (ADA) Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Cardano (ADA) has risen by more than 50% over the past month, buoyed by recent ecosystem launches and expanded stablecoin options. ADA’s sustained community development and regulatory alignment could be factors in its rebound. Avalanche (AVAX), also up 50% over the past 30 days, is being watched for subnetwork upgrades. Analysts argue that these layer-1s are regaining traction not as Ethereum killers but as specialized tools for selective growth sectors. A Measured But Shifting Environment A full altcoin season is not yet confirmed. But with rising participation, declining BTC dominance, and renewed attention on utility-based tokens, the conditions are forming. If momentum continues, the coming weeks could mark a decisive phase in crypto’s internal capital rotation. Altcoin market cycles often move in phases, with early breakouts in majors like ETH and XRP followed by delayed gains in mid- and small-cap tokens. If historical patterns hold, the current broadening could indicate a more sustained altcoin-led period. However, volatility remains high, and sector rotations can reverse quickly. Investors should continue monitoring key indicators like dominance, volume flows, and relative strength to navigate what may be the early innings of an altcoin resurgence.

2025-07-21T19:14:44,"The Node: Altcoin Season?","BTC has been putting on a bit of a one-man show for the last couple of years, rising all the way to $120k while other major cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL are still below their 2021 records. The orange coin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization steadily increased from a little under 40% in December of 2022 to 65% this June. But altcoins finally took a stand this July, with bitcoin dominance sliding 5.8% in a single week, its sharpest drop since June 2022. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here . A quick look over at CoinGecko shows us that a majority of the coins in the Top 100 have risen between 20% to 30% in the past seven days. ETH, which has had a rough two years , outperformed most of the market by notching 26% gains. DOGE , XRP and ADA — the usual suspects in times of elation — are up 40%, 22% and 23% respectively. Meanwhile, SOL finally caught up today by increasing 7%; the coin’s price is now 18% higher than last Monday. “It's not surprising to see bitcoin dominance fall over the last month given progress around digital asset legislation in the U.S. and the continued emergence of altcoin treasury companies,” Brian Rudick, chief strategy officer at SOL treasury firm Upexi, told CoinDesk. “ This legislation is likely to spur more on-chain development and activity and that benefits altcoins more so than bitcoin,” Rudick added. “While the preponderance of digital asset treasury companies continue to be [for BTC], they are increasingly moving down the risk spectrum to assets like ETH, SOL, and beyond.” Case in point: since I last wrote to you on Friday, DeFi Development boosted its SOL holdings to almost $200 million; Bitmine and SharpLink’s leaders openly stated they’re in competition over the accumulation of ETH supply; The Ether Reserve (another ETH treasury firm) announced it will soon trade on Nasdaq (rebranding into The Ether Machine along the way); and a new company called StablecoinX declared its goal of constituting a treasury made of Ethena’s ENA tokens. Not that bitcoin has been unloved. In that same period, Michael Saylor dropped another $740 million into bitcoin, semiconductor firm Sequans invested $150 million, and Trump Media disclosed that its bitcoin stash was worth $2 billion. But the market capitalization of tokens like ETH, SOL and ENA is significantly smaller than bitcoin’s, so these treasury buys tend to have a much larger impact on their price, Rudick said. “As long as the U.S. continues to make progress on digital asset legislation and the market continues to receive digital asset treasury companies well, I would not be surprised if bitcoin dominance continued to fall and altcoin season truly emerges,” he added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/21/the-node-altcoin-season,"BTC|ALTCOIN|REGULATION|SOL|TREASURY","Opinion|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Opinion",cryptocompare

2025-07-21T19:09:49,"Block: Let It Ride On S&P Inclusion?","Summary Block, Inc. stock surged over 46% since my initial Buy call, fueled by S&P 500 inclusion and receding Ark Invest sell pressure. Despite 9% YoY gross profit growth, Block faces slowing growth trends and margin compression in key segments, raising concerns about future profitability. Stablecoins present a credible long-term threat to Block’s core business, though current disruption remains limited to DeFi rather than mainstream payments. After the recent rally and valuation expansion, I’m downgrading XYZ stock to Hold—I’ve trimmed my position but still see some upside from index inclusion. It has been a little over three months since I last wrote about Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) for Seeking Alpha. At that time, I initiated coverage with a Buy rating predicated mainly on two ideas. First, sell pressure from Ark Invest was approaching maturity after the asset manager had sold off most of its holdings. Second, multiple compression had brought shares down to a modest price to earnings ratio. It took a few weeks for the stock to find its footing, but the performance of XYZ since that post has been quite good: Data by YCharts Since my initial coverage of XYZ, the stock has rallied by over 46% against an index (SPY) that - while also impressive - is up just 20% in three months. In this article, I'll provide an updated take on XYZ given the recent rally in the stock. Major Catalyst: S&P 500 Inclusion The price of XYZ jumped by about 10% in post-market trading on the news that the stock will replace Hess (NYSE: HES ) in the S&P 500 (SP500) on July 23rd. As of July 21st intraday, the stock has indeed held most of that gain and is up by more than 8% as of article submission. The reason why S&P 500 inclusion is generally viewed as such a bullish catalyst for a stock is because index-tracking funds like ETFs will buy the stock to be properly weighted to the index. While this doesn't diminish the need for the company to continue executing fundamentally, we have seen index-inclusion greatly enhance the returns of some stocks in the past. Notable examples of stocks that have rallied significantly following S&P 500 inclusion would be Tesla ( TSLA ) and Palantir ( PLTR ); each of which are currently among the top 25 stocks in the world by market capitalization. I don't think we'll see XYZ exhibit the same type of performance for a couple reasons; slowing growth and potential stablecoin disruption. Q1 25 For the quarter ended March 2025, Block reported top line revenue of $5.8 billion. This was a 3% decline from the prior year period and almost entirely attributed to a 15% year-over-year decline in the company's Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) revenue segment. On the surface, this might be concerning, but Bitcoin has historically been Block's least profitable business with meaningful revenue generation: Revenue (000s) Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Transaction-based $1,550,731 $1,511,209 2.62% Subscription and Services $1,890,973 $1,682,294 12.40% Hardware $28,690 $32,501 -11.73% Bitcoin $2,301,402 $2,731,124 -15.73% Total $5,771,796 $5,957,128 -3.11% Source: Block Inc, 10-Q. Transaction revenue increased by 2.6% year-over-year and subscription/service revenue grew by 12.4%. Perhaps more importantly, the company's gross profit of $2.3 billion was a 9% increase year-over-year. Slowing Growth (Block Inc) Though it must be pointed out that last quarter was a continuation of what has become a trend of decelerating profit growth. The company's profit margins actually fell from Q1 24 in the transactions and Bitcoin segments: Gross Margin Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Transaction-based 41.72% 42.22% -1.19% Subscription and Services 85.45% 83.97% 1.77% Bitcoin 2.84% 2.93% -3.29% Source: Block Inc, 10-Q, analyst's calculations. Subscriptions/services margins continue to be impressive and grew almost 2% year-over-year from 84% to 85.5%. That segment currently accounts for 70% of Block's gross profit. The question is, will Block's transaction and subscription segments erode over time as merchants look to cheaper alternatives? Stablecoins Are Disruptive To Block's Primary Profit-Makers With the recent signing of the GENIUS Act in the United States, the green light to innovation in the country has effectively been given. Stablecoin Market Cap (DeFi Llama) The market capitalization for stablecoins globally has surged passed $261 billion. The recent ramp in stablecoin supply is very much a result of President Donald Trump's election victory in November with a 50% surge in supply since election day. The President ran on regulatory clarity and acceptance of digital assets during his campaign. With his signing of the GENIUS Act, he has largely delivered on that campaign promise from where I sit. Now the race to grow stablecoin usage for payments really begins. Stablecoins have seen increased usage through DeFi protocols and yield-based platforms over the last several years. But they have admittedly not been well utilized for peer-to-peer payments or B2C transactions over the years. P2P Stable Supply (Artemis) Artemis calculates ""peer-to-peer"" stablecoin supply as coins that are not held in smart contract wallets like DEXes or DeFi protocols. Back in June 2024, $128.8 billion of the $159.3 stablecoin supply was of the P2P variety - or 80.8% of stablecoin supply. A year later, P2P supply growth - while impressive at 24% - has actually not been as strong as stablecoin growth in smart contract wallets. At $159.6 billion of the $250.0 billion stablecoins in June, P2P share of supply fell from 80.8% a year ago to 63.8% last month. My read on this is stablecoin usage growth is happening mainly through DeFi rather than merchant or P2P usage at this point. This would imply stablecoins are not yet a significant headwind for Block. However, that doesn't mean that trend has to continue. Stablecoin networks are still young. With the regulatory environment in the United States turning more supportive of innovation rather than one that protects incumbent systems, un-gated blockchain networks with low-cost user fees may soon challenge the more walled garden approach of platforms like Cash App or Venmo. Valuation Is Extended Again Back in April, XYZ was exhibiting valuation multiple compression and even had a trailing twelve month earnings ratio that was inline with the sector median. That is no longer the case: Data by YCharts With a trailing twelve month P/E of over 19, XYZ is well ahead of the financials sector median of 13.8. The price to sales ratio looks attractive at just 1.9x trailing sales and 1.8x forward sales, but that number is largely skewed by a Bitcoin business that has a low gross margin compared to Block's transaction and subscription businesses. Block Value Grade (Seeking Alpha) Seeking Alpha's Valuation Grade for XYZ has also deteriorated over the last 3 months having gone from a ""C-"" in mid-April to a ""D-"" as of July 21st. The sales multiples are the only ratios that don't look overvalued. And again, this is largely due to Block's low-margin Bitcoin business accounting for 40% of the top line. Closing Thoughts Given the valuation and the news-related pop that the stuck is currently exhibiting, I certainly wouldn't bemoan taking some profit in this investment for those who bought the lows back in the Spring. I myself have taken a little bit off in this name, but still hold XYZ at this time due to the potential for more upside from S&P inclusion. But I'll reiterate that the S&P 500 inclusion isn't a silver bullet. The company must find a way to grow and thrive in what might be a quickly evolving payments industry. The threat that stablecoins pose to incumbent payment processors is legitimate, though possibly overstated without meaningful advances in ZK proof integration with these systems; nobody should be comfortable with the entire world to knowing every time they buy a coffee with USDC ( USDC-USD ) on Solana ( SOL-USD ). All this said, I'm downgrading XYZ to Hold given the recent run. Again, I'm still long the stock personally, but it's not nearly as ""cheap"" as it was three months ago.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802778-block-let-it-ride-on-s-and-p-inclusion?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION","BTC-USD|USDC-USD|XYZ",cryptocompare

2025-07-21T19:00:29,"XRP Proponent Says the Biggest Pump of Human Civilization Is Just Starting","In a fiery and impassioned video shared on X, renowned cryptocurrency proponent Crypto Bitlord declared that the rally currently unfolding is “the biggest pump of human civilization.” His message, laced with humor, intensity, and unwavering conviction, captures the euphoric sentiment gripping the XRP community as the digital asset climbs to multi-year highs. “This is it. It’s just starting now . Brace yourself,” Bitlord said, urging his followers to abandon conventional logic and embrace the primal mindset of “apes” to survive the emotional rollercoaster of the current market. He warned that anyone unprepared mentally will panic and sell as XRP’s price rises to unimaginable heights. “If something’s not right in your head, you’re gonna sell,” he said. “Take yourself back to the land of apes… You need to be one of those things to survive this market.” This is the biggest pump of human civilization. It’s the end-game. And you’re holding greatness. It’s just starting so brace yourself pic.twitter.com/ORcEJEpTSE — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 20, 2025 XRP’s Price and Market Cap Surge As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.62, reflecting a 3.4% increase in the last 24 hours. The asset’s market capitalization has surged to approximately $212 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s 24-hour trading volume remains strong, exceeding $9.6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This rally represents more than just retail excitement. XRP’s rise has been driven by increasing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and its growing utility in cross-border transactions. The token is also benefiting from favorable macroeconomic trends and increased liquidity across major exchanges. Bitlord’s Message: Beyond Islands, Into the Solar System Crypto Bitlord’s monologue wasn’t merely about price. It was a metaphor-laced rallying cry. “I’m not selling a f***ing cent, mate,” he exclaimed. “When it’s time, I’m only buying tickets to Pluto. Don’t worry about islands—I’m after the solar system.” His message reflects the belief held by many XRP proponents: that this current surge is not just a market cycle, but a historic turning point. Bitlord warns that bearish thinking will have no place in this new era. “If I see you talking about being bearish, I’m blocking you, deleting you, removing you from my life,” he said, emphasizing the need for mental resilience and total commitment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hype Meets Caution While Bitlord’s passionate declaration embodies the excitement of the moment, analysts continue to advise caution. XRP’s parabolic moves, while impressive, also raise the risk of sharp pullbacks. Sudden profit-taking, especially among short-term traders, could trigger significant volatility. Historically, crypto markets have seen emotional highs followed by steep corrections, especially when sentiment becomes overheated. Still, many believe XRP is in the early stages of a much larger breakout. On-chain data shows growing accumulation among whales, and technical indicators suggest the asset is holding firmly above key support levels. If momentum continues, analysts are eyeing short-term targets above $4, with longer-term projections reaching as high as $10 under optimal conditions. Final Thoughts Crypto Bitlord’s viral commentary has struck a chord with the XRP community. Whether his vision of interplanetary wealth is taken literally or symbolically, it underscores the optimism surrounding XRP’s current rally. With the token now trading at $3.62 and its market cap above $212 billion, XRP is firmly in breakout territory. For now, as Bitlord puts it, “It’s just getting going. It’s just kicking off.” Whether you’re on the rocket or still watching from the launchpad, the XRP market is one to watch closely, and perhaps a bit like an ape.

In a post on the messaging platform Telegram, ZachXBT says that an attacker siphoned $44.2 million from CoinDCX and bridged some of the stolen funds from Solana ( SOL ) to Ethereum ( ETH ). CoinDCX co-founder and CEO Sumit Gupta later confirmed the unauthorized withdrawals in a post on the social media platform X. “Today, one of our internal operational accounts – used only for liquidity provisioning on a partner exchange – was compromised due to a sophisticated server breach.” Gupta says the company quickly contained the incident and clarified that the wallets used to store customer assets are not affected and are completely safe. He says CoinDCX is also working to patch vulnerabilities, trace the movement of the funds, as well as block and recover the stolen assets. “Since our operational accounts are segregated from customer wallets, the exposure is only limited to this specific account and is being fully absorbed by us – from our own treasury reserves.” However, ZachXBT says the exchange took much too long to disclose the incident, alleging that CoinDCX waited 17 hours to announce the hack, and may be trying to hype up the exchange on social media.

2025-07-21T18:41:09,"$250,000 Bitcoin Price ‘Makes Sense,’ According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee – Here’s Why","Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could reach a quarter of a million per coin before the year ends. In a new interview with CNBC, the Fundstrat head of research was asked what levels he thinks BTC can reach over the next few months by the end of the year. “I think the $200,000 to $250,000 range for Bitcoin still makes sense, because that would still only value it at 25% of the size of the gold market. So I think digital gold means Bitcoin should be worth over a million dollars per Bitcoin. That could happen in the next few years, but maybe pricing in 25% of that – especially with the Genius Act – makes sense.” Bitcoin is worth $118,096 at time of writing. When asked about the burgeoning stablecoin market, Lee says there is more institutional acceptance happening in the sector. Given much of stablecoins’ reliance on the Ethereum network, Lee says the rise of the sector will likely provide a boost for ETH . “I mean, stablecoins are the ChatGPT moment for crypto, because businesses like it and consumers are adopting them. Now we see JPMorgan and Citi getting into the stablecoin market—and the Genius Act is part of how that’s happening… Well, Circle is one way [to ‘play’ stablecoins], because it’s a standout company. They’ve done really well. But Ethereum is really the way to play stablecoins, because the majority of stablecoins are created on Ethereum. It’s over 30% of Ethereum’s network fees. And if Scott Benson’s right, he says now it’s close to a $4 trillion market.

2025-07-21T18:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Set to Reach $200k, But This DeFi Token Might 100x Faster","As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes the $200,000 milestone, the crypto market’s spotlight is subtly shifting toward an unexpected coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance’s 5th round presale has already sold over 80%. It is priced at $0.03 in this phase and its price will rise by 16.67% in the next phase. The money raised so far is over $12.7 million with over, 13700 unique token holders. With institutional capital circling Bitcoin and retail investors hunting for the next breakout, Mutuum Finance may be the story to watch in the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Bitcoin Eyes $200K on Institutional Surge, Regulatory Momentum Bitcoin is already trading at around a price of almost 118,416, slightly below the recent high of around 119,548. This asset has been going through a consolidation phase after briefly surging beyond $123,000 on news of pro-crypto legislation in Washington. Momentous inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs, exceeding $15 billion to date, and an increase in allocations by corporate treasuries are indicators of heightened confidence by institutional investors which have been driving the rally. Bitwise analysts and Bernstein recommend that structural backing, and supply-related restraints of mining, as well as the dynamic of looming halving in the future, may drive BTC to the $200,000 level in the late 2025s. With Bitcoin gaining a sound foothold on the macro-level, backed by legal certainty and large-pocket financiers, it establishes a platform towards a faster expansion of parallel crypto sectors. Mutuum Finance is in the position to be a part of that emerging story. Mutuum Pioneers Its Next-Generation Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending platform that caters for active as well as passive DeFi users. Passive income can be generated by users lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Besides that, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables lenders and borrowers to exchange as much as they prefer since there is no middle party required. This is usually prevalent with customers of less stable assets like meme coins. Investor Sentiment Continues to Support Mutuum Presale More than $12.7 million has been invested and over 13700 investors have already invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 rockets. This shows investor confidence in the project in the early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 16.67% increase in phase 6. Smart investors are acting fast to grab this bottom price. Security Verified: CertiK Audit with $50K Bug Bounty Protection Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin pegged to the USD on the Ethereum network. Apart from that, the project is audited by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. This kind of audit proves the platform’s willingness to be trustworthy and institution-graded open. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will be rewarded on a four-level severity scale: critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance welcomes its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 lucky winners with $10,000 MUTM as an appreciation for the investors’ first-time faith in the project. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $12.7 million from more than 13,700 investors, selling out more than 80% of its phase 5 presale allocation at $0.03. Phase 6 will push the token price to $0.035, rewarding current buyers with an immediate 16.67% gain and a guaranteed 2x return on listing. Backed by a 95.0 CertiK trust score, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway, MUTM is fast emerging as DeFi’s most promising new token. As Bitcoin climbs toward $200,000, Mutuum Finance offers a faster path to potential 100x gains.

2025-07-21T18:27:33,"Here’s How Much XRP Available for Business Operation","Software engineer Vincent Van Code published a detailed breakdown on Twitter addressing what he describes as a widespread misconception surrounding the total XRP supply. While XRP is often cited as having a 100 billion token maximum supply, Van Code emphasizes that the figure does not reflect the volume truly accessible for business operations such as payments, cross-border settlement, or liquidity provision. In the tweet, Van Code systematically reviews various categories of XRP holdings and exclusions to establish a more accurate estimate of XRP realistically available for real-world financial applications. He identifies substantial constraints that significantly reduce the actual liquid supply from the total minted amount. How Much XRP Is Actually Available for Business Use? Everyone talks about “100 billion XRP” — but how much is truly liquid and usable for payments, liquidity, or cross-border settlements? Let’s break it down. The number may shock you. — 1. Total XRP Supply = 100B But… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) July 19, 2025 Ripple’s Escrow Holdings and the Predictable Lockup Mechanism Van Code first highlights Ripple’s escrow management , which currently accounts for approximately 40 billion XRP. These tokens are released in fixed increments of 1 billion XRP per month, but according to Van Code, most of the released XRP is typically returned to escrow. He estimates that, on average, about 800 million XRP is re-escrowed monthly. Despite the predictable schedule of escrow releases, he maintains that this XRP is not practically liquid and therefore unsuitable for immediate use in fast-moving markets or real-time liquidity provisioning. Lost XRP and Dormant Wallets The tweet also examines the volume of XRP that may be permanently inaccessible. Drawing a parallel with Bitcoin, Van Code suggests that between 5 and 8 billion XRP is likely lost due to forgotten private keys, abandoned wallets, and early-user inaccessibility. This segment, while not officially removed from the circulating supply, no longer plays an active role in the ecosystem. He equates this to roughly 5–8% of the total XRP ever created. Institutional and Whale Accounts Another component examined is the large amount of XRP held by institutions and early stakeholders, including Ripple founders, exchanges, and venture capital firms. These wallets, estimated to hold between 20 and 25 billion XRP, are characterized by low transaction activity. Van Code points out that many of these holders treat their XRP similarly to how investors treat long-term stores of value, preferring to hold rather than engage in frequent trading or liquidity services. He categorizes these as effectively soft-locked due to behavioral patterns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple-Owned XRP Outside Escrow and DeFi Constraints Van Code identifies an additional 6 to 8 billion XRP held by Ripple outside the formal escrow structure. These holdings are reportedly used for strategic purposes such as acquisitions, incentives, or partnerships. Because these tokens are not consistently on the market, they are also excluded from his estimate of liquid supply. He then addresses emerging trends such as decentralized finance on the XRP Ledger. With the recent introduction of the XRPL Automated Market Maker (AMM), XRP is beginning to be locked in liquidity pools. While this segment is still developing, Van Code notes that DeFi mechanisms represent another constraining factor on accessible supply. Final Estimate of Liquid XRP and Market Implications Taking all these segments into account, Van Code concludes that only approximately 12 to 15 billion XRP is realistically available for open market use and business-related liquidity. This equates to just 12–15% of the full 100 billion XRP supply. He refers to this as the “estimated liquid supply,” which excludes escrowed, lost, institutional, and strategic holdings. Van Code concludes his tweet by pointing to potential market implications. He argues that if usage of XRP continues to expand through mechanisms such as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bridges, and tokenized asset transactions, then the already limited liquid supply may be increasingly insufficient to meet demand. In his assessment, as more XRP is locked away or treated as a long-term asset, supply constraints could exert upward pressure on the asset’s price. This analysis offers a distinct perspective on XRP’s supply dynamics. It may inform considerations for investors, enterprises, and liquidity providers evaluating the utility and valuation of the token within the broader digital asset economy.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold above $2.2; however, bears strongly dominated and created a plunge. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns.

Celestia price prediction July 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8.

2025-07-21T18:15:04,"Best Crypto To Buy Now After Trump’s GENIUS Act And Ethereum’s Price Rally","When U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, he cemented a landmark framework for stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. This move not only brings long‑sought regulatory clarity to an industry hungry for legitimacy but also signals a fresh era of mainstream adoption. Concurrently, Ether surged past $3,800, reaching its highest price since January. Trump has officially signed the GENIUS Act into law - the first major U.S. stablecoin regulation.“This signing is a massive validation,” Trump said.- Passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (308-122 House, 68-30 Senate)- Backed by crypto giants: Coinbase, Circle, Tether,… — TopG (@TopG__Crypto) July 19, 2025 By embedding consumer protections and bipartisan oversight into the fabric of digital currencies, the legislation could reshape liquidity and investor confidence alike. As Washington pivots to embrace these new rules, it’s time to consider the best crypto to buy now, leveraging this decisive regulatory milestone for strategic positioning. Trump's Stablecoin Law Ignites Ether Rally: A Win for Crypto, But His Family's Profits Stay Clear Trump signed the new GENIUS Act into law Friday, a big step for crypto firms that've pushed hard for political recognition. This law sets basic rules and consumer protections specifically for stablecoins, which are digital currencies tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to stay stable. The Associated Press reported it sailed through Congress with strong support from both parties. Speaking to about 200 attendees, including crypto execs and top Republicans at the White House, Trump declared, ""For years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out."" He called the signing a ""massive validation"" of the industry's hard work and pioneering spirit. . @POTUS to the crypto community: ""For years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out... this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up... Congratulations on this incredible achievement!"" pic.twitter.com/tj91aFdVKR — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) July 18, 2025 The sector felt unfairly targeted under Biden and poured money into Trump's campaign. Trump even praised crypto leaders for gaining respect ""in such a short period of time,"" arguing support was ""good for the dollar and it’s good for the country."" While the GENIUS Act bans Congress members and their families from profiting off stablecoins, that rule doesn’t touch the president or his family. This is notable as Trump builds a crypto presence from the White House; his family holds a major stake in World Liberty Financial. That project launched its own stablecoin this year and received an early boost from UAE investment. Market-wise, the Ethereum price has surged , reclaiming January highs and turning positive for 2025. It rose double digits this week, marking its strongest two-week gain (over 40%) since 2021. Bitcoin dipped slightly. What changed? Ether ETFs made history Thursday, pulling in $602 million net versus $522 million for bitcoin ETFs, a first-ever lead for ether funds, led by BlackRock. This followed a record $726.7 million ether ETF inflow Wednesday. ""No coin seems to have more momentum than Ethereum lately,"" noted Wolfe Research, observing ETH near five-month highs against bitcoin and suggesting the crypto ""leadership pendulum"" might be swinging its way. Best Crypto To Buy Now With stablecoin rules etched into law and Ethereum outperforming its peers, market dynamics are ripe for fresh opportunities. Regulatory clarity tends to favor tokens with clear on-chain utility and robust governance, setting the stage for renewed inflows. If one is looking for the best crypto to buy now, these conditions could signal a prime moment to invest. Snorter Snorter , a Solana-based trading bot, leverages MEV protection and multichain capabilities to identify high-potential DeFi tokens. With front-running defense, 0.85% fees, and automated sniping on Telegram, it capitalizes on the GENIUS Act's stablecoin surge. Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers the Snorter Bot, an automated tool designed to hunt and snipe the hottest tokens on the market. This bot simplifies the process for traders, eliminating the need for technical expertise or multiple browser extensions. Currently in Stage 2 of its development, Snorter Token is progressing with community beta tests, a Token Generation Event (TGE), and an upcoming launch on the Solana blockchain. These milestones mark significant growth for the project. The Snorter Bot is faster and more efficient than similar services like Radyum, Pump Fun, and Jupiter, executing orders in milliseconds when liquidity becomes available. Its speed sets it apart in the competitive world of token sniping. With its focus on blockchain utility and meme appeal, Snorter Token shows strong potential for long-term growth. The Aardvark sniper mascot isn’t just for fun; it aims to help users generate profits while driving the project’s success. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper blends Bitcoin’s established value with the momentum of a clearer regulatory environment. As institutions turn to stablecoin ecosystems, this hybrid token may attract both speculative and institutional interest. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a new Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, has already raised over $3.5 million in its ongoing presale, attracting attention as a potential multi-bagger investment. As Bitcoin faces scalability challenges, Bitcoin Hyper promises to bring the sophistication and speed of modern blockchains to BTC without sacrificing decentralization. The Bitcoin Hyper project aims to solve the problem by leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for faster, scalable transactions and smart contracts. With this approach, Bitcoin Hyper offers sub-second finality and supports thousands of TPS, something Bitcoin’s Layer-1 cannot do natively. While other solutions like the Lightning Network and Stacks have attempted to scale Bitcoin, they come with limitations such as liquidity issues, security risks, and the need for separate tokens. Bitcoin Hyper eliminates these drawbacks by enabling direct Bitcoin transfers on a Layer-2 network. Bitcoin Hyper’s architecture includes a canonical bridge, which locks BTC on the base layer and mints wrapped HYPER tokens on the Layer-2 chain. This unlocks the ability to use Bitcoin for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs at Solana-like speeds and fees. As reported by the crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins , Bitcoin Hyper is about to take off. The project bundles all Layer-2 activity and commits it back to Bitcoin using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring the integrity of the base layer. This setup allows Bitcoin to remain decentralized and secure while benefiting from faster transaction speeds and greater scalability. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token serves as a key gateway to compliant digital assets. By simplifying user access and leveraging new federal safeguards, it is set to benefit from increased everyday transactions and retail adoption. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility token powering the rapidly expanding Best Wallet ecosystem. It provides holders with benefits like reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto projects, and higher staking rewards. Unlike many tokens that focus on hype, $BEST offers real functionality within a wallet people are actively using. It’s a true utility token, not just a meme coin with empty promises. The presale is happening directly within the app, marking $BEST as the first token to launch through Best Wallet. This level of integration signals strong utility and sets it apart from typical crypto projects. So far, the presale has raised over $13 million, with the current price at just $0.025355. Investors are buying into real infrastructure, not just speculation, making this an enticing opportunity. $BEST is designed for users who want more than a store of value. It’s a tool for accessing the future of Web3, offering token-driven incentives and exclusive ecosystem features. With its growing platform and utility-driven approach, $BEST is poised to become the go-to token for the next generation of Web3 users. It’s still early, but the momentum is undeniable. Conclusion Trump’s enactment of the GENIUS Act marks a watershed moment for stablecoins, embedding consumer protections and bipartisan oversight into the U.S. digital asset framework. This landmark legislation underscores how far the industry has come, transitioning from the fringe to the mainstream and setting a precedent for regulatory maturity. Benefiting some of the major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. For investors, the takeaway is clear: as on‑chain governance and compliance take center stage, selectively positioning in tokens that blend utility with oversight could yield the most durable returns. By focusing on assets built for this new regulatory era, one will be aligning with the best crypto to buy now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-21T18:12:21,"Tom Lee Sees Ether Hitting $15K, With Ethereum Emerging as Wall Street's Favored Blockchain","Ethereum's ether (ETH) may be on the verge of a breakout as institutions begin to realize the blockchain's potential in the same way Silicon Valley embraced artificial intelligence, says Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and chairman of Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine. ""Stablecoins have created the ' ChatGPT moment ' for crypto,"" Lee said in an interview with CoinDeskTV. The asset class, he said, has demonstrated a simple, viral use case as an alternative for payments that resonates with banks, merchants and consumers. Ethereum, boasting over 50% market share of the almost $250 billion stablecoin supply and a key hub for asset tokenization, could be a chain of choice for many institutions to build or use, Lee said. ""Wall Street wants to find a chain that's operating compliantly in the U.S. and they want to find a big one where there's already a lot of real-world assets,"" Lee said. ""That’s why Ethereum is becoming extremely relevant."" While bitcoin's narrative as digital gold is still intact, Lee argued, ETH could offer more upside over the next few years for being the network where institutions tokenize financial assets. Fundstrat analysts put $4,000 as a near-term technical target for ETH, while its ""fair value"" could be around $10,000-$15,000 by the end of this year. ""Our belief that Ethereum is dramatically undervalued as a token,"" Lee said. ""So acquiring an asset that can appreciate by 10 times or more is a really good use of a treasury. Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), a former bitcoin (BTC) miner that has pivoted to an Ethereum treasury strategy with Lee joining as chairman, has already made a substantial bet on that thesis. The firm said last week it accumulated over 300,000 ETH exposure including options, worth well over $1 billion at current prices.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/21/tom-lee-sees-ether-hitting-15k-with-ethereum-emerging-as-wall-streets-favored-blockchain,"ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","Markets|Thomas Lee|Ethereum|Ether|Stablecoins|Tokenization|Bitmine|News",cryptocompare

In a new announcement, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) says it “has accumulated approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities as part of its previously announced Bitcoin treasury strategy.” Amid the news, shares of DJT, which includes the social media platform Truth Social, soared from Friday’s close of $18.67 to $20.38 on Monday, a more than 9% gain. Shares have retraced slightly and are trading for $19.58 at time of writing. Says Trump Media’s CEO and President Devin Nunes, “We’re rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan. These assets help ensure our company’s financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we’re planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere.” Last month, the media firm was given the green light by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to invest its treasury holdings in Bitcoin. The firm says its Bitcoin holdings now represent some two-thirds of its approximately $3 billion in liquid assets. Trump Media also says it has about $300 million of additional capital “allocated to an options acquisition strategy for Bitcoin-related securities.” Says the announcement, “Trump Media plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related assets and to convert its options into spot Bitcoin, depending on market conditions.” Bitcoin treasury companies are publicly traded or private companies that hold BTC on their balance sheets as part of their treasury reserve strategy.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
