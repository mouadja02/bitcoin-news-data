2025-07-21T10:55:14,"Bitcoin Acquisition: Sequans’ Bold Move Fuels Massive Crypto Expansion","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Sequans’ Bold Move Fuels Massive Crypto Expansion The world of corporate finance is undergoing a fascinating transformation, with an increasing number of publicly traded companies looking beyond traditional assets to bolster their balance sheets. In a move that has captured significant attention within the cryptocurrency community, Nasdaq-listed Sequans Communications, an innovator in the IoT semiconductor and module development space, has once again made headlines with its strategic Bitcoin acquisition . Sequans’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive into Corporate Crypto Holdings In a bold demonstration of its conviction in digital assets, Sequans Communications recently announced the purchase of an additional 1,264 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $150 million. This significant investment, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, substantially increases the company’s crypto treasury. With this latest acquisition, Sequans’ total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 2,317 BTC. What makes this Bitcoin acquisition even more intriguing is Sequans’ forward-looking strategy. The company has publicly stated its intentions to issue $380 million in convertible bonds, with the explicit purpose of funding further BTC acquisitions. This innovative approach highlights a growing trend among corporations to leverage diverse financial instruments to deepen their exposure to the digital asset market. Sequans’ Bitcoin Holdings at a Glance: Metric Details Latest BTC Purchase 1,264 BTC Cost of Latest Purchase $150 million Total BTC Holdings (Current) 2,317 BTC Planned Funding for Future Acquisitions $380 million via convertible bonds This systematic approach to accumulating Bitcoin suggests a long-term view from Sequans, positioning itself to benefit from the potential appreciation of the cryptocurrency while also diversifying its corporate treasury assets. Why are Companies Pursuing Bitcoin Acquisition as a Core Strategy? Sequans is not an isolated case. The past few years have seen a noticeable shift, with more and more corporations, from tech giants to traditional businesses, exploring or actively engaging in Bitcoin acquisition . But what exactly is driving this trend? Several compelling reasons underpin this evolving corporate treasury strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its capped supply of 21 million coins offers a stark contrast to traditional currencies, which can be printed indefinitely. Store of Value: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin’s characteristics as a decentralized, immutable, and globally accessible asset make it an attractive store of value, particularly for companies seeking to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Traditional corporate treasuries typically hold cash, short-term bonds, and other low-yield assets. Adding Bitcoin provides a new asset class that behaves differently from conventional investments, potentially enhancing portfolio resilience and returns. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and its willingness to engage with cutting-edge technologies. It positions the company at the forefront of the digital economy, potentially attracting tech-savvy investors and talent. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth. Companies acquiring Bitcoin anticipate benefiting from its potential price appreciation, adding a new revenue stream or value component to their balance sheet. Prominent examples like MicroStrategy, which has amassed tens of thousands of Bitcoin, and Tesla, which has held significant amounts, have paved the way, demonstrating that corporate Bitcoin acquisition is a viable and increasingly adopted strategy. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, companies undertaking Bitcoin acquisition also face a unique set of challenges. It’s crucial for any corporation considering this path to be fully aware of the potential pitfalls and to implement robust strategies to mitigate them. Key challenges include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. A sudden downturn can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet, leading to potential impairment charges and investor scrutiny. Managing this volatility requires a strong conviction and a long-term outlook. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, accounting treatment, or asset classification could pose risks and necessitate adjustments to a company’s strategy. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security protocols to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Companies must invest in secure cold storage solutions and robust cybersecurity measures. Accounting and Reporting Complexities: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin can be complex. In many jurisdictions, it’s treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, meaning companies must record impairment losses if its value drops below the acquisition cost, even if the price later recovers. This can lead to non-cash losses impacting financial statements. Public and Investor Perception: While some investors applaud such moves, others might view Bitcoin acquisition as a risky or speculative endeavor, potentially impacting stock performance or attracting short-sellers. To address these challenges, companies must conduct thorough due diligence, establish clear risk management frameworks, consult with legal and financial experts specializing in digital assets, and ensure transparent communication with stakeholders. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for the Future of Corporate Treasuries? Sequans’ latest move, particularly its plan to fund future purchases through convertible bonds, underscores a significant shift in how companies perceive and manage their treasury assets. This isn’t just about holding a speculative asset; it’s about integrating a new class of digital assets into core financial strategy. The increasing adoption of Bitcoin acquisition by public companies could have profound implications for the broader financial landscape. Consider the potential ripple effects: Mainstream Acceptance: Each new corporate adoption of Bitcoin lends further legitimacy and helps to normalize its presence in traditional finance. This could accelerate its journey towards becoming a widely accepted reserve asset. Innovation in Financial Products: The demand for corporate Bitcoin holdings could spur the development of new financial products and services tailored for institutional investors, such as specialized custody solutions, lending platforms, and derivatives. Competitive Pressure: As more companies realize the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin, a “fear of missing out” (FOMO) could emerge, prompting competitors to explore similar strategies to maintain their competitive edge and appeal to a new generation of investors. Impact on Market Liquidity: Consistent corporate buying, especially from large entities, could absorb significant amounts of Bitcoin from the market, potentially influencing its supply-demand dynamics and price stability over the long term. Sequans Communications, by embracing this innovative approach to corporate finance, is not only optimizing its own treasury but also contributing to the ongoing evolution of institutional involvement in the digital asset space. Their strategy could serve as a blueprint for other companies looking to diversify and future-proof their financial holdings in an increasingly digital world. In conclusion, Sequans Communications’ continued and expanding Bitcoin acquisition strategy marks a pivotal moment for both the company and the wider cryptocurrency market. It signifies a growing confidence among publicly traded entities in Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset, capable of hedging against inflation, diversifying portfolios, and offering long-term growth potential. While challenges such as volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain, the innovative funding mechanisms and the sheer scale of these corporate investments suggest that digital assets are firmly establishing their place in the corporate treasury playbook. This trend is likely to accelerate, shaping the future of finance and redefining how companies manage their wealth in the digital age.

2025-07-21T10:37:07,"Trump’s first 6 months fuel 15,000 new Bitcoin millionaires","The number of Bitcoin ( BTC ) millionaires has surged in the first half-year of Donald Trump’s second term as President, according to new data from Finbold Research. Between January 20 and July 20, 2025, a total of 15,841 new Bitcoin wallet addresses reached millionaire status, bringing the overall count to 192,205, representing a 9% increase in just six months, with an average of 88 new millionaire addresses added every day. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Finbold Research analyzed the data using figures retrieved from BitInfoCharts , with historical snapshots verified through the Wayback Machine . The findings show a consistent increase across all tiers of high-value addresses, but the sharpest growth came among those holding over 10 million dollars worth of Bitcoin. This top bracket grew by more than 16% over the period, indicating that institutional players and early adopters are doubling down on their positions. This upward trend in high-value BTC holdings comes amid a broader wave of optimism in the crypto sector. On November 6, 2024, the day after Trump secured re-election, there were 132,842 Bitcoin millionaire addresses. The subsequent growth of more than 59,000 addresses in less than nine months highlights a dramatic rise in both market activity and investor confidence. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin is soaring under the pro-crypto presidency One of the key drivers behind this surge is the shifting regulatory environment in the United States. In a landmark move earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed the country’s first major piece of cryptocurrency legislation. The bill, officially named the GENIUS Act , was signed into law by President Trump on July 18 in a ceremony at the White House. The legislation is seen as a turning point for the digital asset space, offering long-awaited clarity on taxation, stablecoin issuance, and institutional custody rules. Markets responded swiftly. In the days following the vote, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies soared to a record-breaking 4 trillion dollars. This momentum appears to be reflected in Bitcoin’s price action as well. The combination of rising prices, increasing wallet counts, and supportive policy signals a new phase for the crypto market in the United States. With President Trump vowing to turn the country into the global hub for digital assets, and regulatory clarity finally taking shape, Bitcoin millionaires may soon become a much more common phenomenon.

2025-07-21T10:36:33,"Crypto Funds Hit Record $4.39B Weekly Inflows – Biggest Rally Coming Soon?","Digital asset investment products recorded an all-time high in weekly inflows of $4.39 billion, surpassing the previous record of $4.27 billion set after the U.S. election in December 2024 and pushing total assets under management to a historic $220 billion, according to CoinShares . The surge marks the 14th consecutive week of inflows, bringing year-to-date totals to $27 billion as institutional appetite intensifies across Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Institutions are Flocking Crypto Weekly trading turnover in exchange-traded products reached record levels globally at $39.2 billion, driven by elevated volumes in both major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum stole the spotlight with a record $2.12 billion in inflows, nearly doubling its previous record of $1.2 billion and bringing 2025 inflows to $6.2 billion, exceeding the entire 2024 total. Source: CoinShares The past 13 weeks of inflows now represent 23% of Ethereum’s total assets under management. Bitcoin attracted $2.2 billion in inflows, down from last week’s $2.7 billion, while ETP trading volumes comprised 55% of total Bitcoin exchange volume. Notably, the United States dominated regional flows with $4.36 billion in inflows, while Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Australia recorded modest positive flows. Source: CoinShares The massive capital influx coincides with Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act and his sharing of the “greatest Bitcoin explanation of all time” video , creating perfect storm conditions for continued institutional adoption. In fact, over 273 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5. Ethereum Breaks Multiple Records as Institutional Interest Surges Ethereum’s $2.12 billion weekly inflow smashed all previous records, with the 13-week cumulative total representing an unprecedented 23% of the cryptocurrency’s assets under management. This compares favorably to Bitcoin’s 9.8% inflow-to-AUM ratio over the same period. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $2.18 billion in weekly net inflows from July 14 to 18, setting a new all-time high and marking eight consecutive days of positive flows. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge with substantial institutional adoption, while Fidelity and Grayscale products contributed to the broad-based demand. The surge positions Ethereum ETFs as serious competitors to Bitcoin products in terms of institutional appeal, especially as Bitcoin dominance is decreasing. Weekly trading volumes doubled year-to-date averages, with global ETP turnover hitting record levels as institutional and retail investors pile into regulated Ethereum exposure. Solana, XRP, and Sui also benefited from the altcoin momentum, recording inflows of $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively. Notably, BlackRock reported $14.1 billion in digital asset net inflows for Q2 2025 , pushing the firm’s crypto assets under management to $79.6 billion. Digital assets contributed $14 billion of BlackRock’s $85 billion total ETF inflows during the quarter, establishing crypto as one of the fastest-growing product categories. Corporate Treasury Adoption Accelerates Amid Regulatory Clarity According to Reuters , public companies worldwide have increased their Bitcoin holdings by 120% since July 2024, now controlling just over 859,000 Bitcoin, representing 4% of the total 21 million supply. The corporate treasury trend has gained momentum following regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and favorable legislative developments. Reuters reports also show that less than 5% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets are held by long-term institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments, with 10-15% owned by hedge funds or wealth management firms. The bulk of ETF ownership remains retail-driven, indicating substantial room for institutional growth as the adoption of ETFs matures. MicroStrategy continues to lead corporate Bitcoin adoption with over 600,000 BTC, while companies like Japan’s Metaplanet have recently purchased $93 million worth to become the fifth-largest corporate holder. Similarly, France’s Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new treasury allocations worth $12.5 million and $24.3 million, respectively. The correlation between retail crypto ETF purchases and price rallies has intensified, with Vanda Research data showing heavy retail buying during Trump’s election victory and the recent legislative breakthrough. Corporate treasury companies have emerged as bigger demand drivers than traditional institutional investors. Bloomberg ETF analysts assign a 95% probability to the SEC approval of spot Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs this year, up from 90% previously amid growing institutional product optimism. A crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, adding more to the possibilities of a parabolic rally driven by massive institutional interests. Regionally, most of these inflows are expected to come from the United States, as the CoinShare report indicates that flows were concentrated heavily there, with $4.36 billion in inflows last week. In comparison, Germany experienced $15.5 million in outflows, and Brazil also saw $28.1 million in outflows.

I requested a lot more detail and context in several areas, but it’s shaping up quickly… I believe we are on schedule for a mid‑August release, assuming the work continues at this pace and there are no delays.” Why The Cardano Audit Is Needed The audit is the centerpiece of Hoskinson’s effort to rebut accusations that IOG quietly commandeered roughly $600 million worth of ADA during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. The charge—first amplified in May by NFT artist Masato Alexander—claims Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to rewrite the ledger and move 318‑350 million unclaimed tokens into company‑controlled wallets. Hoskinson has repeatedly rejected the story as a “lie,” insisting most of the disputed coins had already been claimed by their original buyers and that the remainder “was donated to Intersect” after a seven‑year dormancy period. “No matter how many times people lie, they cannot change reality,” he wrote on 6 May. The episode escalated after social‑media headlines in late May suggested a $600 million “theft.” “I’m absolutely disgusted… The headlines I’ve seen are beyond damaging; they will require months if not years of work and millions of dollars to undo post‑audit,” Hoskinson posted on 20 May, pledging to pay for an independent review and to publish it in full. IOG’s chief legal and policy officer Joel Telpner confirmed progress on the investigation in a parallel X update: “We are making good progress on the investigative and audit report that we promised to deliver. The law firm and audit firm are close to completing their work and we are hoping the report will be ready to release by the middle of August. I’ll continue to keep you updated.” Hoskinson also signaled a legal counter‑offensive, telling followers he will meet “with the defamation law firm next week to discuss options and strategy,” a move he says is aimed at recovering what he characterizes as “hundreds of millions of dollars of brand damage” to Cardano. The forthcoming report will be aired live: Hoskinson intends to read the entire document in a livestream and to host the PDF—along with “other historical artifacts from the sale”—on a dedicated website. Market reaction has been restrained so far. ADA changed hands at roughly $0.84 when the latest update hit social media—flat on the day but still up 17 percent on the week.

2025-07-21T10:25:18,"Merlin Chain Unleashes Bitcoin’s Ultimate Potential with 2.0 Upgrade","BitcoinWorld Merlin Chain Unleashes Bitcoin’s Ultimate Potential with 2.0 Upgrade For years, Bitcoin (BTC) has stood as the undisputed king of cryptocurrency, a digital store of value revered for its security and decentralization. Yet, its inherent design, prioritizing robustness over flexibility, has often limited its direct utility beyond being a “digital gold.” Imagine a world where your BTC isn’t just sitting idle, but actively working for you, earning yields, participating in decentralized finance, and powering innovative applications—all without ever truly leaving the secure embrace of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is the ambitious vision driving the latest evolution in the Bitcoin landscape: Merlin Chain 2.0. The announcement of Merlin Chain ‘s 2.0 upgrade has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community. This isn’t just another layer-2 solution; it’s a bold declaration of intent to transform Bitcoin from a passive asset into a dynamic, productive force. By integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and chain abstraction, Merlin Chain aims to unlock unprecedented liquidity and utility for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, making it more accessible and functional than ever before. What is Merlin Chain 2.0 and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Merlin Chain 2.0 represents a significant leap forward in making Bitcoin truly productive. The team behind Merlin Chain has articulated a clear mission: to empower users to “hold, earn, and invest without leaving the BTC ecosystem.” This vision directly addresses one of Bitcoin’s long-standing challenges – its limited programmability and high transaction fees on the mainnet, which often push users towards other blockchain networks for more active engagement. So, how does Merlin Chain plan to achieve this? It leverages a layer-2 architecture, meaning it operates on top of the Bitcoin mainnet, processing transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs, then periodically settling them back onto the main chain for security. The 2.0 iteration introduces several key enhancements: Enhanced Productivity for BTC Holders: No longer content with just HODLing, users can now actively deploy their Bitcoin in various decentralized applications (dApps) built on Merlin Chain , opening avenues for yield generation and investment opportunities. Seamless User Experience through Chain Abstraction: One of the biggest hurdles for new users in crypto is the complexity of managing multiple chains, bridges, and wallets. Chain abstraction, a core tenet of Merlin Chain 2.0, aims to simplify this by abstracting away the underlying blockchain complexities. Imagine interacting with a dApp and not needing to worry about which specific chain your assets are on – it just works. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and makes the entire ecosystem more intuitive. AI Integration for Smarter Operations: While specific details are still emerging, the mention of AI integration suggests intelligent automation, optimized resource allocation, and potentially enhanced security features within the Merlin Chain ecosystem. AI could play a role in optimizing transaction routing, identifying potential risks, or even personalizing user experiences. The significance of Merlin Chain 2.0 lies in its potential to not only enhance Bitcoin’s utility but also to foster a vibrant, self-contained ecosystem around it. By keeping users within the BTC fold, it strengthens Bitcoin’s overall network effect and prevents value from flowing out to other chains for productive activities. How Does Merlin Chain Enhance Bitcoin’s Utility? The journey to make Bitcoin more productive involves a multi-faceted approach, and Merlin Chain is tackling it head-on. Let’s delve deeper into the mechanisms that allow this layer-2 solution to unlock new possibilities for BTC. Bridging the Gap: BTC on Layer-2 Traditionally, using Bitcoin for anything beyond simple transfers has been challenging due to its design. Merlin Chain acts as a bridge, allowing Bitcoin to be securely locked on the mainnet while its equivalent is represented and utilized on the faster, more flexible layer-2. This process, often involving cryptographic proofs and secure bridging mechanisms, ensures that the underlying BTC remains secure and verifiable. Unlocking Liquidity: A Sea of Opportunities One of the most exciting prospects of Merlin Chain 2.0 is its ability to unlock the immense, often dormant, liquidity of Bitcoin. Trillions of dollars in BTC sit in wallets globally. By enabling this capital to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications, Merlin Chain can inject significant capital into these emerging sectors. This isn’t just about moving money; it’s about activating it, allowing it to generate returns and contribute to the growth of a broader digital economy. For instance, imagine providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange on Merlin Chain using your Bitcoin, earning trading fees, or staking your BTC to secure the network and receive rewards. Simplifying User Experience with Chain Abstraction The concept of “chain abstraction” is a game-changer for user adoption. In today’s multi-chain world, users often need to understand complex bridging processes, different gas tokens, and specific wallet configurations for each blockchain. Merlin Chain aims to abstract these complexities away. This means a user could potentially interact with a dApp without even realizing they are transacting on a layer-2. The underlying infrastructure is handled seamlessly, presenting a unified and intuitive experience. This simplification is crucial for bringing the next wave of users into the crypto space, making the powerful capabilities of Bitcoin more accessible to everyone, not just seasoned crypto enthusiasts. The Role of AI in Merlin Chain: Smarter, Faster, Safer The integration of Artificial Intelligence into Merlin Chain 2.0 is a forward-thinking move. While the specifics are still being unveiled, AI can contribute in several vital areas: Optimized Transaction Routing: AI algorithms can analyze network conditions to find the most efficient and cost-effective paths for transactions, ensuring speed and affordability. Enhanced Security Protocols: AI can be deployed to monitor for unusual activity, identify potential threats, and bolster the overall security posture of the layer-2, protecting users’ assets. Personalized User Experiences: AI might learn user preferences and behaviors to offer tailored dApp recommendations or optimize interface elements, making the platform even more user-friendly. Resource Management: Intelligent allocation of computational resources can ensure the network runs smoothly, even under heavy load. This blend of layer-2 technology, chain abstraction, and AI positions Merlin Chain as a formidable player in the quest to expand Bitcoin’s utility far beyond its traditional role. Challenges and Opportunities for Merlin Chain While the vision for Merlin Chain 2.0 is undeniably exciting, no ambitious project is without its challenges. Understanding these hurdles, alongside the immense opportunities, provides a balanced perspective on its potential trajectory. Navigating the Scalability Seas One of the primary reasons for layer-2 solutions like Merlin Chain is to address Bitcoin’s scalability limitations. While layer-2s significantly increase transaction throughput, they still face their own scaling challenges as adoption grows. Ensuring the network can handle a massive influx of users and transactions without compromising speed or cost will be an ongoing engineering feat. Robust infrastructure and continuous optimization will be key. The Ever-Present Security Imperative For any solution built on top of Bitcoin, security is paramount. Users are entrusting their valuable BTC to the layer-2, making the integrity of bridging mechanisms, smart contracts, and network validators critical. Merlin Chain must maintain an impeccable security record, employing rigorous audits, bug bounty programs, and transparent security practices to build and maintain user trust. Any perceived vulnerability could significantly hinder adoption. Standing Out in a Crowded Landscape The crypto space is dynamic and competitive. Merlin Chain isn’t the only project aiming to enhance Bitcoin’s utility. Other layer-2s, sidechains, and innovative protocols are also vying for attention. Merlin Chain ‘s unique selling points—its focus on chain abstraction and AI integration—will need to be clearly articulated and deliver tangible benefits to attract and retain users amidst this competition. Immense Opportunities for Growth Despite these challenges, the opportunities for Merlin Chain are vast. The sheer size and value of the Bitcoin market represent an enormous untapped potential for DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications. By successfully making Bitcoin more productive, Merlin Chain could: Attract New Capital: Bring in institutional and retail investors who prefer the stability of Bitcoin but desire more active engagement with their assets. Foster Innovation: Become a fertile ground for developers to build novel applications that leverage Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. Drive Mass Adoption: Simplify the user experience to a degree that onboard millions of new users who might otherwise be intimidated by crypto complexities. Solidify Bitcoin’s Role: Further cement Bitcoin’s position not just as a store of value, but as the foundational layer for a new financial and digital economy. The success of Merlin Chain will depend on its ability to execute its vision, address technical hurdles, and effectively communicate its value proposition to a global audience. Real-World Impact: What Can Users Do with Merlin Chain? So, what does all this mean for the everyday Bitcoin holder? The promise of Merlin Chain 2.0 is to open up a world of possibilities, allowing your BTC to move beyond passive storage and into active participation within the decentralized ecosystem. Here are some actionable insights into what users can potentially do: DeFi on Bitcoin: Unlocking Financial Freedom Imagine using your Bitcoin directly in decentralized finance protocols. With Merlin Chain , this could become a reality. Users might be able to: Lend and Borrow: Provide your BTC as collateral to borrow other assets, or lend your BTC to earn interest. Provide Liquidity: Deposit your BTC into decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Merlin Chain to earn trading fees, contributing to the liquidity of various trading pairs. Yield Farming: Participate in complex strategies to maximize returns on your Bitcoin, often involving staking and providing liquidity across multiple protocols. This transforms Bitcoin from a mere asset into a powerful financial tool, enabling users to generate passive income and engage with innovative financial instruments. Gaming and NFTs: A New Frontier for Bitcoin The explosion of blockchain gaming and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has largely occurred on other networks due to Bitcoin’s limitations. Merlin Chain aims to change this. Imagine owning in-game assets or unique digital collectibles, denominated in BTC or secured by the Bitcoin network’s robustness. Developers could build play-to-earn games or NFT marketplaces directly on Merlin Chain , offering a new layer of utility and engagement for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Staking and Yield Generation: Making Your BTC Work While Bitcoin itself isn’t typically “staked” in the same way proof-of-stake coins are, layer-2 solutions like Merlin Chain can introduce mechanisms for yield generation. This might involve: Delegated Staking: Contributing your BTC to secure the Merlin Chain network and earn rewards, similar to how some proof-of-stake networks operate. Liquidity Provision Rewards: Earning tokens or fees for providing liquidity to dApps within the Merlin Chain ecosystem. These mechanisms provide compelling incentives for users to bring their Bitcoin onto the layer-2, transforming dormant assets into income-generating ones. The table below provides a quick comparison of traditional Bitcoin holding versus Bitcoin on Merlin Chain : Feature Traditional Bitcoin Holding Bitcoin on Merlin Chain (2.0) Primary Use Store of Value, Peer-to-Peer Transactions Store of Value, Active Participation in DeFi, NFTs, Gaming Transaction Speed Slower (approx. 10 mins per block) Much Faster (near-instant on L2) Transaction Cost Can be High, especially during congestion Significantly Lower Earning Potential Price appreciation only Yield generation, staking rewards, trading fees, etc. Complexity for dApps High/Limited Low (via chain abstraction) This shift from passive to productive Bitcoin represents a monumental change, potentially ushering in a new era for the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. The launch of Merlin Chain 2.0 marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin. By courageously addressing the limitations of the mainnet and embracing innovative solutions like AI and chain abstraction, Merlin Chain is not just building a layer-2; it’s constructing a bridge to a future where Bitcoin is not only the most secure digital asset but also the most versatile and productive. The vision of holding, earning, and investing your BTC without ever leaving its native ecosystem is no longer a distant dream but an increasingly tangible reality. This transformative approach promises to unlock immense liquidity, simplify user interactions, and foster a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications directly powered by Bitcoin. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, projects like Merlin Chain are essential in pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, ensuring Bitcoin remains at the forefront of innovation and utility for decades to come.

2025-07-21T10:21:56,"Here is When to Buy Bitcoin According to Rich Dad Poor Dad Author","The vocal advocate for financial education has shared his thoughts on the state of the markets. This comes at a time of relentless accumulation and adoption, offering a different perspective on current affairs. Bubbles Are About To Start Bursting Those are the words with which Kiyosaki started his post on the social media platform X early this morning. The entrepreneur further added, “ When bubbles bust, odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too .”, which he thinks is good news, as if the prices of these assets drop, he will be buying. This comment follows last week’s post by the investor, who celebrated the leading cryptocurrency reaching over $120,000. The sentiment was more positive, as it was “ Great news for those who already have some Bitcoin .”, whilst further stating that it was unfortunate for people who had not yet purchased any. The author still recommends caution with accumulation levels, “to not get slaughtered like a hog,” as he anticipates the economy’s reaction before buying more. “If you have not begun acquiring BITCOIN….I suggest starting very small… starting with a Satoshi.” His stance on the largest cryptocurrency has changed constantly throughout the month, as he noted at the start of July, “ CLICK BAIT Losers keep warning of a Bitcoin crash. ” Furthermore, a market newsletter, Brew Markets, shared a sheet with prior predictions of market crashes dating back to 2011, suggesting that the author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” series had been incorrect on multiple occasions. Source: Brew Markets Bitcoin Is Still Doing Well Regardless ofKiyosaki’s impressions of the top cryptocurrency, its performance remains stable. According to data from CoinMarketCap at the time of this writing, the BTC dominance is 60%, representing the relative market share of Bitcoin in the overall cryptocurrency space. Although, it’s worth noting that there has been a notable decline in this metric throughout the past week. Altcoins have been outperforming in what many describe as an altcoin season, but it it’s interesting to see if this form of capital rotation will persist. The site also tracks 30 of the leading market cycle indicators that traders often use to try to predict the top of the crypto market cycle, and none of them have triggered so far. With institutions, retailers, governments, and the public pouring millions into the asset, it continues to set records across the board.

2025-07-21T10:20:48,"Senator Warren Slams GOP’s Crypto Plan, Warns of ‘Presidential Corruption’","The post Senator Warren Slams GOP’s Crypto Plan, Warns of ‘Presidential Corruption’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is stepping into the spotlight with a new set of principles for regulating the crypto industry. As the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a well-known critic of digital assets, she’s pushing for stronger rules to protect the financial system from what she sees as growing risks in the crypto space. Her announcement comes as a direct response to Republican lawmakers, setting the stage for a serious political showdown over crypto regulation in Washington. Warren Pushes Back: No More Handouts for Crypto Warren’s plan challenges the approach laid out by Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.). Their framework, introduced in late June, promotes innovation and lighter regulation. Warren strongly disagrees . “I’m concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout that gives the crypto lobby everything on its wish list,” she is expected to say during a Senate hearing on Wednesday. She warns that weakening financial regulations to favor crypto could undermine securities laws and create risks for the traditional financial system. According to Warren, crypto should not get special treatment, instead it should play by the same rules as the rest of the financial world. Warren’s Key Priorities: Stability, Oversight, and Accountability Warren’s framework centers on four key goals: Protecting the financial system from instability Enforcing anti-money laundering (AML) laws Ensuring investor safety Preventing public officials from using crypto for personal gain She will also address concerns over “ President’s crypto corruption “, highlighting President Donald Trump’s and his family’s ventures in stablecoins, meme coins, and bitcoin mining. “If we’re going to provide rules of the road for crypto, we need to shut down this superhighway for presidential corruption at the same time,” Warren will argue. Her approach is about tightening rules, not creating new ways for crypto insiders or politicians to benefit. Republicans Say Innovation Must Come First Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are focused on encouraging innovation. Their framework calls for updated regulations that are “targeted” and “pro-innovation,” and suggests that financial agencies should be open to the growth of crypto. Warren, however, believes this approach puts the industry ahead of investor protections and opens the door to future financial problems. September Is the New Deadline The Senate is preparing to introduce a broader crypto market structure bill. This comes after passing the GENIUS Act , which focuses on stablecoin regulation. That bill now heads to the House for review. The upcoming market structure bill will deal with how oversight of the crypto industry is divided between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Senators Scott and Lummis say they now aim to pass the full bill by the end of September, slightly later than their original August timeline. Warren’s proposed framework brings a tougher stance to the crypto conversation, standing in sharp contrast to the Republican vision. Let’s see how this plays out.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/senator-warren-slams-gops-crypto-plan-warns-of-presidential-corruption/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|COMMODITY","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-21T10:20:45,"Altcoins Rally- Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano Price Surge as Bitcoin Slows","The post Altcoins Rally- Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano Price Surge as Bitcoin Slows appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is showing fresh signs of life beyond Bitcoin. As BTC hovers just below $120,000, altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana are gaining strong momentum. This shift is happening as traders look for new opportunities and investors bet on projects with strong real-world connections. Altcoins Join the Party Ethereum jumped to $3,793 , its highest price since early 2022. The rise is being driven by strong interest from institutions, especially in new Ethereum-based treasury products and ETF flows. With this recent push, Ethereum has gained 25 percent in just one week. Traders are also seeing the ETH to BTC ratio rise, which means Ethereum is starting to perform better compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin is another standout this week . It shot up by more than 9 percent in the last 24 hours and is now up over 33 percent for the week. It’s trading at around 27 cents, the highest it’s been in over a year. Traders are showing more interest in riskier assets again, which is helping coins like Dogecoin. Meanwhile, apart from ETH and Doge, XRP is also making a move, priced around $3.55 with a 4% gain, while Solana jumped to $189. Cardano and BNB also posted gains of over 3 percent. Analysts say Bitcoin’s dominance is falling, down from 66% in June to just under 62 percent now, which suggests traders are rotating their money into altcoins. Is This Alt Season? Most alt seasons only last 1–2 months. Until #Bitcoin dominance breaks down and trends lower, don’t expect a true alt run. Alts pump when #BTC is breaking out but once it chops or corrects, dominance returns and gains vanish fast. Be careful and play it smart. pic.twitter.com/6YZturOEc1 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Crypto analyst VirtualBacon cautions that true altcoin seasons are usually short-lived, lasting only 1–2 months. He explains that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin is breaking out, but once Bitcoin slows down or corrects, its dominance rises again, causing altcoin gains to quickly disappear. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoins Heat Up as Bitcoin Cools, But Is the Rally Ending Soon? , Real-World Use Cases Catch Investor Attention However the trend of capital flow from BTC to Alts is not new. A big reason for this rotation is the growing interest in real-world asset tokenization. This includes turning things like treasury bonds, credit, and real estate into blockchain-based tokens. The total value of tokenized real-world assets has now crossed $24 billion. Big financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are already exploring this space. New Laws Could Help Altcoins Grow More There’s also hope that new U.S. laws could make it easier for altcoins to grow. The GENIUS Act , which focuses on stablecoins and digital asset taxes, is still being discussed in Congress. Even though it didn’t pass this week, its progress shows that clearer rules are coming. In short, the market is changing. Bitcoin is still strong , but more traders are looking at Ethereum, Dogecoin, and real-world crypto projects as the next big opportunity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-21T10:12:57,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns Bitcoin Bubble Could Burst, Plans to Buy After Dip","Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has warned that Bitcoin, gold, and silver could soon face a sharp correction, diverging from the current optimism among crypto analysts. On Monday, Kiyosaki said , “Bubbles are about to start busting,” and added that he expects these assets to drop significantly before he plans to buy more. His comments come just days after celebrating Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $120,000 , where he remarked that the rally was “bad news” for those who never invested, claiming, “They own nothing.” Despite his previous enthusiasm , Kiyosaki also cautioned investors to avoid overextending themselves in the crypto market, famously saying, “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.” He had earlier stated he would buy one more Bitcoin before pausing further purchases to watch where the economy is heading. Mixed Signals from Kiyosaki Spark Debate Kiyosaki’s recent bearish stance contrasts with his earlier criticism of “clickbait losers” who warn of Bitcoin crashes, arguing that such predictions aim to scare speculators away from the market. This inconsistency has led to criticism from some corners of the crypto community. The market newsletter Brew Markets highlighted that Kiyosaki has issued multiple crash warnings for both crypto and stock markets, many of which did not materialize. Despite discussions about Bitcoin and crypto treasuries displaying bubble-like characteristics , experts remain divided. Joe Burnett, director of Bitcoin Strategy, dismissed the bubble argument, explaining that companies accumulating Bitcoin are not betting on untested ideas but are investing directly in what they consider sound money. According to Burnett, the perception of a bubble persists because many still do not understand Bitcoin’s underlying value. Investors Urged to Conduct Independent Research Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer at Apollo Capital, encouraged investors to rely on their own research rather than following “influencers” for investment decisions. Similarly, “Cape,” an NFT collector and founder of the Furyou collection, pointed out that Bitcoin has been labelled a scam and a bubble nearly every year since its inception, yet it continues to recover and grow. Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle pattern remains intact, with analysts expecting 2025 to mark the bull market peak if the pattern holds. Current projections place Bitcoin’s potential top between $130,000 and $200,000 by year-end, while CoinGlass’s bull market dashboard shows no signs of an imminent peak. Kiyosaki’s warning, while noteworthy, may serve as a reminder for investors to assess their risk appetite and long-term strategies before making decisions amid Bitcoin’s volatile but historically cyclical market movements.

2025-07-21T10:07:07,"US President Donald Trump Releases New Bitcoin Post! ""The Biggest Bitcoin Statement of All Time!""","US President Donald Trump shared a new Bitcoin (BTC) post. Trump shared a video on his Truth Social account and wrote, “The greatest Bitcoin statement of all time.” The video shared by Trump includes Coin Center Research Director Peter Van Valkenburgh's statements about Bitcoin in his testimony to the US Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in 2018. In the video, Valkenburgh defended Bitcoin and open blockchain networks, defending their decentralized nature, usefulness in financial innovation, and potential to promote individual freedom and privacy. “Why is Bitcoin revolutionary? Because unlike other tools for sending money over the internet, it works without the need for an intermediary,” Valkenburgh said in the video. Trump's post came just days after he signed the GENIUS Act. Donald Trump's new legislation and Bitcoin posts represent a stark contrast to his previous views. In 2021, Trump called Bitcoin a scam and claimed that cryptocurrencies were weakening the US dollar. However, since his candidacy, Trump has stated that he sees Bitcoin and digital assets as central to American innovation and financial sovereignty. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-21T10:00:00,"Is this the next BTC? Buyers expect 100x gains from $0.03 before 2026 begins","While BTC revolutionised peer-to-peer currency and store-of-value narratives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking aim at an equally critical frontier: real-yield DeFi. But unlike speculative tokens lacking intrinsic use cases, MUTM is building on fundamentals, combining a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin system with a dual-yield staking ecosystem. Together, these innovations are shaping what many investors believe will be crypto’s next exponential story. With projections placing MUTM at $3.00 by early 2026, the current $0.03 price tag reflects a 100x opportunity hiding in plain sight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a stablecoin design focused on responsible issuance and on-chain stability. The stablecoin can only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets like ETH, ensuring that every token in circulation is backed by collateral exceeding its value. This structure prevents arbitrary creation and limits systemic risk. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the corresponding stablecoins are automatically burned, keeping the supply tightly regulated. To help maintain a consistent $1 peg, borrowing interest rates are managed through governance—not market demand—and can be adjusted strategically. Arbitrage mechanisms further support the peg by incentivizing users to buy or sell when price deviations occur. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further apart is its mtToken staking model. Whenever users lend crypto through the protocol, they receive mtTokens that track and accrue interest. These mtTokens can then be locked into smart contracts that participate in a buyback-powered reward system. Revenue from interest payments and loan activities is used to repurchase MUTM from the open market. These purchased tokens are redistributed to those who stake mtTokens, turning passive lending into compounding gains. Final weeks to secure $0.03 before 20% jump in phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is now drawing global attention, with numbers that validate strong early traction. Phase 5 has already raised $12.70 million, with over 13,750 holders securing their positions ahead of the next pricing milestone. Currently, MUTM tokens are selling at $0.03, but this is about to change as Phase 6 kicks in with a 20% hike to $0.035. With 85% of the current tranche already sold, only a short window remains to lock in tokens at this ultra-low level. Lenders will soon be able to earn handsomely in the platform’s peer-to-contract (P2C) model. For example, lending $18,000 worth of LINK at a 55% loan-to-value ratio would generate a 10% APY, equal to $1,800 annually, all while the asset remains safe in a lending vault. Meanwhile, the peer-to-peer (P2P) side is designed for borrowers seeking flexible terms. A user could pledge $3,500 in TRUMP memecoins to borrow $1,400 in BUSD, with custom repayment structures that let users retain price exposure to volatile tokens while accessing stable liquidity instantly. Security remains a central pillar of the project’s growth. A full audit by CertiK returned a 95.00 Token Scan score and a 77.50 Skynet score—two of the highest trust signals in today’s DeFi space. On top of that, a $50,000 bug bounty has been launched to encourage responsible disclosures and platform integrity. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway is already drawing in a global community of early adopters who are building long-term positions. One Phase 2 investor who swapped a portion of their BTC and ETH for MUTM is now watching a 2x gain in real time. With a listing price of $0.06 and a projected target of $3.00 by early 2026, that same investor is on track for a 200x return. These are the kinds of stories that defined early Bitcoin (BTC) believers—back when BTC was $10 and most of the world hadn’t caught on. A Roadmap Designed for Global Dominance Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap spans four detailed phases. Phase 1, which is currently underway with most milestones already achieved, focuses on launching the presale, executing marketing campaigns, initiating community growth, completing a smart contract audit, implementing an AI-powered helpdesk, and listing on tracking platforms. Pending tasks include developing educational content and forming a legal and compliance team. Phase 2 will begin the development of core smart contracts, DApp front-end and back-end infrastructure, risk parameters, and advanced analytics tools, with ongoing internal and external audits. Phase 3 will introduce beta testing on testnet, establish a bug reporting system, finalise documentation, and prepare for exchange listings. Finally, Phase 4 will launch the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, activate token claims, list MUTM on exchanges, expand into regional compliance, initiate institutional partnerships, and pursue cross-chain integration and platform enhancements. Whales are already rotating out of slow-growth assets and into next-cycle plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With presale availability nearing its end and the next price increase approaching rapidly, this is the moment for those seeking asymmetric upside. Bitcoin (BTC) changed the world once. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to lead the next generation of decentralised financial infrastructure, and reward its earliest believers the most.
