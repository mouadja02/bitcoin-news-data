2025-07-21T05:55:18,"Bitcoin Dominance Plunges: Unlocking Explosive Altcoin Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dominance Plunges: Unlocking Explosive Altcoin Potential Are you feeling the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a significant shift underway. For years, Bitcoin has reigned supreme, its market capitalization dwarfing all others. This metric, known as Bitcoin dominance , has long been a barometer for the health and direction of the broader crypto ecosystem. However, recent data points to a fascinating and potentially pivotal change: Bitcoin dominance has slipped to a four-month low, sparking renewed interest and excitement around altcoins. What does this mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? What is Bitcoin Dominance and Why Does it Matter? Understanding Bitcoin dominance is crucial for any crypto investor. Simply put, it’s the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it suggests that Bitcoin holds a larger share of the overall crypto market value, often indicating a ‘flight to safety’ during bearish periods or a period of strong Bitcoin-led rallies. Conversely, a decline in Bitcoin dominance often signals that altcoins are gaining traction, attracting more capital, and potentially outperforming Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin dominance has fluctuated. During the 2017 bull run, it saw a significant dip as altcoins exploded. It then rebounded, only to dip again during subsequent altcoin seasons. This metric provides a valuable lens through which to view market sentiment and capital flows. A shift in Bitcoin dominance can indicate: Changing Investor Sentiment: A move from conservative Bitcoin holdings to riskier, higher-potential altcoin investments. Emerging Narratives: New technologies or use cases in the altcoin space drawing significant attention. Market Maturation: The overall crypto market becoming more diversified and less solely dependent on Bitcoin’s movements. The Current Dip in Bitcoin Dominance : What’s Happening? Recent data from BeInCrypto reveals a compelling story. Over just five days, Bitcoin dominance has dropped from 64.5% to 60.9% – a significant 5.6 percentage point decline. This marks its lowest level in approximately four and a half months, a clear signal that the spotlight is shifting. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a trend that warrants close attention. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the change: Metric Previous (Approx. 5 Days Ago) Current (Approx.) Change Bitcoin Dominance 64.5% 60.9% -5.6 percentage points This decline in Bitcoin dominance suggests that capital is flowing out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s a classic sign of an ‘altcoin season’ potentially brewing, where investors seek higher returns in assets with smaller market caps but greater growth potential. Why Are Altcoins Gaining on Bitcoin Dominance ? The shift away from high Bitcoin dominance isn’t arbitrary. Several factors contribute to altcoins capturing more of the market’s attention and capital. Understanding these drivers can help you anticipate future market movements: Innovation and Utility: Many altcoins are at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering unique solutions in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and supply chain management. These real-world applications and evolving ecosystems attract investors looking for utility beyond just a store of value. Lower Entry Barrier & Higher Volatility: Compared to Bitcoin’s relatively high price per coin, many altcoins offer a lower entry point, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. While this comes with higher risk, the potential for significant percentage gains is often more appealing, especially to those seeking aggressive growth. Specific Narratives and Hype Cycles: Certain altcoins or sectors (e.g., meme coins, AI tokens, Layer-2 solutions) can experience intense periods of hype and rapid price appreciation, drawing in retail and even institutional investors seeking to capitalize on emerging trends. Technological Advancements: Continuous development in blockchain technology, such as scalability improvements, cross-chain compatibility, and enhanced security features, makes various altcoin projects more robust and attractive. The collective strength of these factors is challenging the long-standing reign of Bitcoin dominance , ushering in a more diversified and dynamic crypto landscape. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Opportunities and Challenges Beyond Bitcoin Dominance A declining Bitcoin dominance presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges for investors. It’s crucial to approach this shift with a balanced perspective. Opportunities: Diversification Benefits: Relying solely on Bitcoin can limit potential gains. Exploring altcoins allows for portfolio diversification, spreading risk and potentially capturing growth from various sectors of the crypto market. Higher Growth Potential: While riskier, many altcoins have smaller market caps, meaning a smaller influx of capital can lead to significant percentage price increases compared to Bitcoin. Exposure to Innovation: Investing in altcoins means supporting and benefiting from cutting-edge blockchain technologies and applications that are shaping the future of finance and technology. Challenges: Increased Volatility and Risk: Altcoins are generally far more volatile than Bitcoin. They can experience rapid price swings, and many projects may not succeed in the long run. The risk of capital loss is significantly higher. Information Overload and Research Burden: The sheer number of altcoins and the complexity of their underlying technologies can make it challenging for investors to conduct thorough due diligence. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Understanding these dynamics is key to making informed decisions as Bitcoin dominance continues its evolution. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Amidst Changing Bitcoin Dominance Given the current trend in Bitcoin dominance , what steps can you take to optimize your crypto portfolio? Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before investing in any altcoin, delve deep into its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, community, and tokenomics. Understand its value proposition and competitive landscape. Don’t chase hype without understanding the fundamentals. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin dominance is falling, Bitcoin still remains a cornerstone. Consider a balanced portfolio that includes a core allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum, supplemented by a carefully selected basket of altcoins across different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer-1s, Layer-2s, Gaming, etc.). Implement Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear profit targets and stop-loss orders. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility and avoid trying to time the market perfectly. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves at lightning speed. Follow reputable news sources, analyze market data, and stay updated on technological developments and regulatory changes that could impact altcoins and Bitcoin dominance . Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy: Decide whether you are investing for short-term gains or long-term growth. Altcoins can offer quick profits but often come with higher risk. A long-term perspective can help weather market fluctuations. By adopting these strategies, you can navigate the dynamic landscape of changing Bitcoin dominance more effectively and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities in the altcoin space. The recent dip in Bitcoin dominance to a four-month low is more than just a statistical blip; it signifies a crucial evolution within the cryptocurrency market. It highlights a growing maturity and diversification, where innovative altcoins are increasingly capturing investor attention and capital. While Bitcoin remains the foundational digital asset, the expanding universe of altcoins offers compelling opportunities for growth and utility. This shift underscores the importance of a well-researched and diversified investment approach. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding the nuances of Bitcoin dominance and the burgeoning altcoin ecosystem will be paramount for every investor looking to thrive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a drop in Bitcoin dominance mean for the crypto market? A drop in Bitcoin dominance typically indicates that altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) are gaining market share, attracting more investment, and potentially outperforming Bitcoin. It often signals a period of increased interest and growth in the broader altcoin ecosystem. Q2: Is a low Bitcoin dominance always a good sign for altcoins? While a declining Bitcoin dominance often correlates with an “altcoin season” where many altcoins see significant gains, it’s not always a universally good sign. It can also indicate increased risk appetite in the market, which can lead to higher volatility and potential for larger losses in altcoins if market sentiment shifts rapidly. Q3: Should I sell all my Bitcoin if dominance is falling? Not necessarily. Bitcoin remains the largest and most established cryptocurrency, often acting as a store of value. A declining Bitcoin dominance suggests a shift, not an abandonment. Many investors maintain a core Bitcoin holding while diversifying into altcoins to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Always consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. Q4: How often does Bitcoin dominance fluctuate? Bitcoin dominance fluctuates constantly, but significant shifts often occur during major market cycles. It can drop during strong bull markets when altcoins rally aggressively, and it can rise during bear markets or periods of uncertainty as investors seek the relative safety of Bitcoin. Q5: What factors contribute to altcoins gaining market share over Bitcoin? Key factors include innovation in areas like DeFi and NFTs, lower entry barriers for investors, specific project narratives, technological advancements that improve scalability and utility, and the overall maturation and diversification of the cryptocurrency market beyond just Bitcoin.

2025-07-21T05:30:00,"Michael Saylor Again Signals New Bitcoin Purchase","The company’s bullish momentum propelled its market cap past $118 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s social media dominance recently surged to 43%, which is historically seen as a sign of short-term cooling, though analysts are still very divided on what BTC’s next move will be. Meanwhile, macro voices like Tim Draper argue that a declining US dollar—not halving cycles—will drive Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Strategy Gearing Up for More Bitcoin Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, hinted at another major Bitcoin (BTC) purchase after the company’s holdings surpassed $71 billion. On July 14, Strategy bought 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, pushing its total stash to 601,550 BTC. This trove is now valued at over $71.4 billion,and generated around $28.5 billion in unrealized gains. This is according to data from SaylorTracker. Strategy continues to be a dominant force in the current Bitcoin bull cycle, alongside institutional investors, ETFs, and crypto exchanges. The company's bullish stance paid off in equity markets as well. Strategy’s stock climbed 15.2% over the past month, which helped push its total market valuation past $118 billion. Strategy stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The surge coincides with the broader market momentum, including the overall crypto market capitalization almost breaching the $4 trillion mark in July and Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Strategy's growing prominence was rewarded in December of 2024, when it was added to the Nasdaq 100 index, thanks to increased institutional interest. Many institutional investors seek Bitcoin exposure but are restricted by mandates that prevent direct crypto purchases. Instead, they turn to Bitcoin-focused public companies or corporate debt products as proxies. Macro strategist Lyn Alden explained that several fund managers are bound by rules that limit their portfolios to equities only, barring them from holding bonds, ETFs, or commodities—including Bitcoin itself. A prime example of this workaround is Vanguard. Despite its longstanding opposition to Bitcoin, Vanguard now owns 20 million shares of Strategy, which accounts for 8% of the company’s outstanding stock. This indirect investment strategy means that Bitcoin is getting integrated deeper into traditional finance, as even conservative legacy firms look for exposure through compliant, publicly traded vehicles. Social Buzz Signals Bitcoin Cooldown? Bitcoin’s new all-time high of close to $123,100 captured almost half of all crypto-related social media discussions and triggered debate about whether retail investors are driving the rally or still sitting on the sidelines. According to sentiment analysis platform Santiment, Bitcoin mentions made up 43.06% of all crypto chatter as its price peaked. This is an unusually high level of dominance that historically preceded short-term pullbacks. Analyst Brian Quinlivan pointed out that the sudden rise in discussion signals a potential wave of retail FOMO, which often coincides with local tops in the market. This contrasts with other industry views, like Bitwise’s André Dragosch. He believes retail interest is still limited despite Bitcoin’s record highs. Bitcoin social dominance (Source: Santiment ) Just days after the peak, Bitcoin retraced to around $117,011, reinforcing the pattern Santiment warned about. Quinlivan advised that waiting for sentiment to cool could provide a better entry point, and specifically pointed out similar optimism spikes on June 11 and July 7 that led to price dips. Despite these cautionary signals, not all analysts agree that the rally is nearing its end. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr mentioned that Bitcoin has not yet triggered its “peak signal” metric, which typically indicates market overheating. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey suggested the asset might enter a brief consolidation phase but still has room to climb higher by the end of the month. Bitcoin’s Future Driven by Dollar Decline Tim Draper, founding partner of Draper Associates, believes that macroeconomic forces, particularly the weakening of the US dollar, will play a larger role in Bitcoin’s future than the halving cycles that have traditionally driven its boom-and-bust patterns. In an interview , Draper predicted that the dollar could become extinct within the next 10 to 20 years, and described the current transition as an “anthropological leap forward.” He sees Bitcoin as a global “escape valve” from inflation, institutional distrust, and geopolitical instability, arguing that these larger forces are accelerating adoption of the supply-limited cryptocurrency. Tim Draper While Draper acknowledged that Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle will continue to influence its price, he suggested that its impact may weaken over time in the face of dominant macroeconomic trends. He expats that a broader macro driver will shape Bitcoin’s trajectory more in the future. This view is very different from those who still believe the halving cycle remains intact, including Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca. However, Bitwise analyst Jeff Park agreed with Draper’s broader view earlier this year, and pointed to Bitcoin’s potential growth amid geopolitical tensions, inflation, and a fading US dollar. Meanwhile, the US government emphasized the role of dollar-backed stablecoins in preserving the dollar’s reserve currency status, particularly by leveraging blockchain infrastructure to expand global access. On the other hand, Bitcoin advocates like Max Keiser argue that dollar-pegged stablecoins are only a short-term fix.

Price action remains pinned between ascending support and a descending trendline, keeping volatility tight but suggesting an imminent breakout. The short-term structure is coiled, with bulls trying to capitalize on the recent bid recovery from the $116,000 zone. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price?

2025-07-21T05:10:19,"UK Bitcoin Sale: The £5 Billion Decision That Could Reshape the Nation’s Finances","BitcoinWorld UK Bitcoin Sale: The £5 Billion Decision That Could Reshape the Nation’s Finances The world of cryptocurrency is abuzz with news that the UK government is eyeing a colossal sale of seized Bitcoin (BTC) to bolster its struggling economy. This isn’t just about selling digital assets; it’s a bold financial maneuver that could have far-reaching implications for both the nation’s coffers and the broader crypto landscape. The proposed UK Bitcoin sale , valued at over £5 billion ($6.7 billion), aims to plug a significant budget deficit, marking a pivotal moment in how governments interact with digital currencies. What’s Behind the UK Bitcoin Sale? A Strategic Move or a Risky Gamble? In an unprecedented move, the UK Treasury, led by Chief Rachel Reeves, in collaboration with the UK Home Office, is setting the wheels in motion for the sale of a substantial cache of seized Bitcoin. This initiative, first reported by Cointelegraph citing The Telegraph, represents a direct response to the nation’s pressing economic downturn and the need to address a significant budget deficit. The plan involves working closely with police and other related agencies to establish a robust system for offloading these digital assets. While the exact total amount of Bitcoin seized by the UK government remains undisclosed, a significant portion of this digital hoard includes at least 61,000 BTC. This particular sum was confiscated in 2018 from a massive Chinese Ponzi scheme that had operations extending into the UK. The sheer scale of this seizure, now valued at billions of dollars, presents a unique opportunity for the government to generate much-needed revenue. However, it also raises critical questions about the long-term implications of such a sale. The decision to liquidate these assets is driven by the immediate fiscal pressures facing the UK. Like many nations, the UK has grappled with economic challenges, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering effects of global events. By converting these seized digital assets into fiat currency, the government hopes to inject a substantial sum into the national budget, potentially funding public services or reducing national debt. This pragmatic approach highlights the evolving recognition of cryptocurrencies as valuable, albeit unconventional, assets in national finance. Is Selling Seized Bitcoin a Wise Financial Decision for the UK? While the prospect of a multi-billion-pound windfall is appealing, the proposed UK Bitcoin sale is not without its critics and potential pitfalls. One of the most vocal opponents is Jordan Walker, founder of the crypto advocacy group Bitcoin Collective. In a formal letter addressed to the UK government, Walker articulated concerns that selling what he terms “strategic assets” like Bitcoin to cover a short-term budget deficit could lead to “long-term consequences for the UK’s economic positioning.” Walker’s argument hinges on the idea that Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, could appreciate significantly over time. Liquidating it now, despite the immediate financial gain, might mean forfeiting potentially much greater future value. This perspective frames Bitcoin not merely as a seized asset to be disposed of, but as a potential long-term investment or even a strategic reserve for the nation, similar to traditional gold reserves or foreign currency holdings. Furthermore, the legal and diplomatic landscape surrounding these seized assets is complex. Chinese authorities, alongside victims of the original Ponzi scheme from which the 61,000 BTC were seized, are actively demanding the return of these funds. This adds a layer of international legal entanglement to the UK’s plans, potentially leading to disputes and delays. The government will need to navigate these demands carefully, balancing its financial needs with international legal obligations and ethical considerations. The debate also extends to the broader implications for the UK’s stance on digital assets. Will this sale signal a utilitarian view of crypto – merely as a means to an end – or will it be seen as a pragmatic step by a government willing to adapt to new financial realities? The outcome of this decision could set a precedent for how other nations manage similar seized assets in the future. Navigating the Legal Maze: Repatriation and Ownership of Seized Assets The legal framework surrounding seized digital assets, especially those obtained from international criminal enterprises, is intricate. The case of the 61,000 BTC from the Chinese Ponzi scheme is a prime example. While the UK government seized these funds within its jurisdiction, the original crime and its victims are predominantly in China. This creates a significant challenge regarding the rightful ownership and potential repatriation of the assets. International law often dictates that assets derived from criminal activity should, where possible, be returned to the victims or the jurisdiction where the crime primarily occurred. However, the process is rarely straightforward, involving mutual legal assistance treaties, complex investigations, and often lengthy court battles. The demands from Chinese authorities and the victims add a critical dimension to the UK Bitcoin sale , potentially complicating or even delaying the government’s plans. The UK government must demonstrate transparency and adherence to legal principles throughout this process. Any perceived misstep could damage international relations and undermine confidence in its handling of such cases. Establishing a clear, legally sound mechanism for the sale, while also addressing claims from affected parties, will be paramount. The Global Precedent: How Other Nations Handle Seized Crypto The UK is not the first nation to seize significant amounts of cryptocurrency from criminal activities. Various governments worldwide have accumulated digital assets through law enforcement actions. However, their approaches to managing and liquidating these assets differ. Understanding these precedents can provide context for the UK’s current strategy. Here’s a brief look at some common approaches: Auctioning Off: Many governments, including the United States, have historically opted to auction off seized cryptocurrencies. This method typically involves public sales to the highest bidder, often through specialized auction houses. The aim is to achieve market value and liquidate assets efficiently. Holding as Strategic Reserve: A less common, but increasingly discussed, approach is to hold seized crypto as a long-term asset, similar to gold reserves. This strategy is based on the belief that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will appreciate over time and could serve as a hedge against inflation or a future store of value. Direct Sale to Institutions: Some jurisdictions might consider direct sales to large institutional buyers, especially for significant quantities, to minimize market impact and ensure a swift transaction. Comparison of Government Approaches to Seized Bitcoin: Approach Description Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Public Auction Selling through open bidding processes. Transparency, market-driven pricing. Price volatility, potential for market impact if large volumes. Strategic Holding Retaining assets for long-term appreciation. Potential for significant future gains, national reserve. Foregoes immediate funds, price volatility risk, storage security. Direct Institutional Sale Selling directly to large financial entities. Efficiency, less market disruption (potentially). Less transparency, potential for accusations of favoritism. The UK’s proposed method of setting up a system with police and agencies suggests a structured, potentially direct, or managed sale process, aiming for efficiency and control over the market impact of such a large UK Bitcoin sale . What Could the UK Bitcoin Sale Mean for the Crypto Market? The sheer volume of Bitcoin potentially entering the market from the UK government’s sale could have noticeable implications. While the crypto market is vast and increasingly liquid, a sale of 61,000 BTC (or more, if other seizures are included) is significant. For context, 61,000 BTC represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume on major exchanges. Potential Market Impacts: Short-Term Price Volatility: A large, sudden influx of Bitcoin onto exchanges could exert downward pressure on prices, at least temporarily. However, governments typically try to mitigate this by selling in tranches or through OTC (over-the-counter) desks to institutional buyers, which minimizes direct market impact. Investor Sentiment: The news itself, regardless of the sale method, could influence investor sentiment. Some might view it negatively, fearing a ‘dump’ of assets, while others might see it as a sign of government acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s value, even if for liquidation purposes. Increased Supply: While the overall supply of Bitcoin is capped, a large sale increases the circulating supply available on exchanges, which could subtly shift supply-demand dynamics. Precedent for Future Sales: If the UK’s sale is successful and well-managed, it could encourage other governments holding seized crypto to follow suit, potentially leading to more supply entering the market over time. Market participants, especially large institutional investors and traders, will be closely watching the details of how the UK government executes this sale. Transparency and a measured approach will be key to minimizing any adverse effects on the broader crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for UK Finance and Crypto The UK government’s intention to sell billions of dollars worth of seized Bitcoin represents a crucial juncture for the nation’s financial strategy and its relationship with digital assets. It’s a pragmatic response to immediate economic pressures, offering a substantial injection of funds to address the budget deficit. However, this bold move is also fraught with complexities, from the long-term economic implications highlighted by crypto advocates to the intricate legal demands for repatriation from international authorities and victims. The UK Bitcoin sale will undoubtedly be a closely watched event, setting a precedent for how governments globally manage and monetize seized digital assets. Its execution will test the UK’s ability to navigate the nascent world of cryptocurrency finance, balancing immediate fiscal needs with strategic foresight and international legal obligations. Whether it proves to be a shrewd financial maneuver or a missed opportunity for future gains, one thing is clear: the UK is taking a significant step into the evolving landscape of digital finance, with consequences that will resonate far beyond its borders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the UK government planning to do with seized Bitcoin? The UK government, through the Treasury and Home Office, plans to sell seized Bitcoin (BTC) worth over £5 billion ($6.7 billion) to help fill the country’s budget deficit. How much Bitcoin is the UK government planning to sell? While the total amount is undisclosed, it includes at least 61,000 BTC seized from a Chinese Ponzi scheme in 2018. The total value is estimated to be over £5 billion ($6.7 billion). What are the main arguments against selling the seized Bitcoin? Critics, like Jordan Walker of Bitcoin Collective, argue that selling strategic assets like Bitcoin for short-term budget relief could lead to “long-term consequences for the UK’s economic positioning,” suggesting it might be better to hold them for potential future appreciation. Who is demanding the return of the seized Bitcoin? Chinese authorities and victims of the Ponzi scheme from which a significant portion of the Bitcoin was seized are demanding the return of these funds. How might this sale impact the Bitcoin market? A large-scale UK Bitcoin sale could potentially cause short-term price volatility due to increased supply. However, governments often try to mitigate this by selling in tranches or through private institutional sales to minimize direct market disruption. What are the legal implications of this sale? The sale faces legal complexities, particularly regarding international claims for repatriation from Chinese authorities and victims. The UK government must navigate these demands while ensuring transparency and adherence to international legal principles. Found this analysis of the UK’s massive Bitcoin sale insightful?

The $3.50 level has become the line in the sand, if XRP can close above it with enough trading volume, it could clear the path straight to $4. On the flip side, if the price slips below $3.35, a quick pullback to around $3.10 wouldn’t be a surprise. Still, many would see that as a healthy dip before the next leg up. XRP ETF Rumors and Political Buzz Fuel Momentum But the story doesn’t end with price action. U.S. President Donald Trump stirred things up with a recent post on his social media platform, sharing a video that explained Bitcoin. While it wasn’t directly about XRP, the post sent a ripple (pun intended) through the entire crypto space. Trump’s gesture added fuel to the idea that digital assets are gaining mainstream attention, and possibly even political support. On top of that, there’s growing chatter around a potential XRP ETF in 2025. If it gets the green light, it could pave the way for big institutional players and even pension funds to enter the XRP market. That kind of demand could change the game entirely. For now, XRP is holding its ground, outperforming many other top tokens. With the charts lining up, political support increasing, and ETF hopes rising, the push toward $4 doesn’t seem too far-fetched and it just might be getting started.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-price-prediction-as-trump-tweets-about-crypto/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

According to Coingecko, the NFT market cap has crossed $6 billion after a nearly 20% increase in the past 24 hours. Also, the overall sales volume has increased by a staggering 195%, indicating renewed interest in digital art. CryptoPunks floor price up 15% The bold move had an immediate effect.

Source – NFTPRICEFLOOR Larva Labs launched CryptoPunks in 2017, and most participants consider them the Bitcoin of NFTs, often acting as a proxy for sentiments around non-fungible tokens. There are only 10K distinct CryptoPunks characters in existence. The scarcity has made these pixel arts prized collectables for celebrities, tech-savvy individuals, and crypto-native investors. The latest purchase by a large-scale investor confirms CryptoPunks’s financial and enduring cultural value despite the highs and lows NFTs have seen since the 2021/2022 boom.

Top collectables like Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Moonbirds have recovered in the previous week, gaining 6%, 3%, and 196%, respectively. The NFT marketplace is regaining strength, and large-scale transactions could encourage other whales and retail buyers to join the bandwagon. Proponents trust this might be the start of a bull run in the NFT market, especially as digital assets exhibit bullish price structures. Indicators such as declining Bitcoin dominance, Ethereum’s current outperformance, and the ASI (Altcoin Season Index) suggest a materialising altcoin season.

2025-07-21T05:00:42,"The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways","Bitcoin has already shown a lot of strength in recent times, pushing as high as $123,000 before trailing back down toward $117,000. So far, it looks like the digital asset has hit a roadblock and is now possibly looking at a peak. But analyst Merlijn The Trader has explained that it is far from over for Bitcoin with more rallies to come. He reveals that the Bitcoin price is yet to stage its ‘final act’, which must happen before there are talks of a top. Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Still In Play After the Bitcoin price rallied to new all-time highs pre-halving, which had never happened before, there were talks that the 4-year cycle had been broken. For clarification, the 4-year cycle is tied to the Bitcoin halving events, which take place every four years, cutting block rewards for miners in half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible However, the reduction in block rewards is not the only interesting thing about the 4-year cycle, because each halving also ushers in a new bull market. This has been the case for the past three bull cycles, and Bitcoin is also expected to follow this. Historically, the market rallies for around a year after the halving, with the top being reached one year later. Going by this trend, the Bitcoin price and the crypto market at large are expected to keep rallying before topping later this year. Pointing to this 4-year cycle, the analyst forecasts another stretch of price increases. The chart shows that price often declines for one year and then rallies for three years, and so far, the Bitcoin price has only been rallying for two, leaving 2025 as another year for rallying. Additionally, Bitcoin is still a long way from levels that have previously marked the top of previous bull markets. Thus, there is still a while before it hits its peak in 2025. Besides, each bull cycle has seen Bitcoin rise 3x higher than its previous all-time highs, and it is year to hit even 2x higher than its previous $69,000 high. How High Can BTC Go? If the 4-year cycle is still in play, then it means that the Bitcoin price rally is far from done. In the analyst’s chart, he shows the possible top for Bitcoin based on past cycles, and BTC is still in the middle of the box. The top of this box puts the BTC price at around $200,000 before a top can be reached. Related Reading: XRP Hits New ATH, But $3.12 Retest Still In Play The analyst warns that Bitcoin is about to enter what he refers to as the “greenest stretch of them all”, pointing to another rally to all-time highs. If this forecast plays out, then Bitcoin is expected to see another 50% rally before the bull market is done.
