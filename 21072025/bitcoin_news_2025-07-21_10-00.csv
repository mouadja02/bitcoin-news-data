2025-07-21T07:40:30,"Japan‚Äôs yen rose after Ishiba‚Äôs party lost the election","The Japanese yen jumped early Monday, catching traders off guard just hours after Shigeru Ishiba‚Äôs ruling party suffered a historic blow in the July 20 upper-house election. At 11 a.m. Tokyo time (10 p.m. ET Sunday), the yen strengthened 0.22% against the U.S. dollar, rising to 148.49, after sinking for two straight weeks on fears that Ishiba‚Äôs government would lose its parliamentary majority. Despite the defeat, the yen (still seen as a fallback when global tensions climb) found buyers fast. The currency‚Äôs two-week slide had tracked voter polls showing Ishiba‚Äôs administration in trouble. That forecast turned out right. But rather than spiral, the yen rebounded as investors processed the fallout. The safe-haven logic kicked in: with global markets unstable and Washington turning up trade pressure, Japan‚Äôs currency became the lesser evil. The sharp swing also came as markets across the Asia-Pacific opened the week on a volatile note. China leaves lending rates unchanged as yuan stays flat Over in China, the People‚Äôs Bank of China decided Monday to hold both its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates steady, adding to the cautious tone across regional markets. The offshore yuan barely moved. By 9:50 a.m. local time (9:50 p.m. ET Sunday), it nudged up just 0.02%, landing at 7.1788 per dollar. The message from Beijing was clear: no rate cuts, no stimulus surprises, at least for now. Stocks in Hong Kong and mainland China started Monday on the front foot. The Hang Seng Index was up 0.55% and the CSI 300 rose 0.28% as of 9:42 a.m. local time (9:42 p.m. ET Tuesday). That bounce came right after the central bank‚Äôs move to keep its main borrowing rates unchanged. But the optimism was cautious, as most investors remained focused on external threats, especially trade. In Washington, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned Sunday that August 1 would be the ‚Äúhard deadline‚Äù for countries to start paying tariffs. He added, ‚ÄúNothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1,‚Äù suggesting negotiations can continue, just not without cost. The U.S. position has once again rattled Asia‚Äôs exporters, with currency and stock traders trying to gauge how far this pressure will go. Singapore‚Äôs dollar weakens while stocks keep running Singapore‚Äôs currency is getting squeezed. The Singapore dollar, already under strain as the U.S. dollar rallies, came under more pressure Monday. The White House‚Äôs latest threat of new tariffs , especially on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, hit hard. Those two sectors are among Singapore‚Äôs top exports. And with trade risks rising, analysts at Barclays Plc and Asia Decoded Pte. are now saying the Monetary Authority of Singapore could ease its exchange-rate policy as early as this month. The speculation over policy easing comes as Singapore tries to shield its economy from external shocks. The stronger dollar and tariff threats are stacking up fast. Still, despite the pressure, the city-state‚Äôs Straits Times Index is on a roll. On Monday, the benchmark climbed for an 11th straight session, hitting a new high of 4,225.79 before pulling back slightly to 4,215.22 by 10:10 a.m. local time (10:10 p.m. ET). The biggest gains came from the utilities, financials, and real estate sectors. Top movers included Mapletree Logistics Trust, which rose 1.69%, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, which gained 1.67%, and Keppel, which added 1.36%.a India‚Äôs markets didn‚Äôt share the same momentum. The Nifty 50 Sensex index fell 0.26% by 9:30 a.m. IST (12 a.m. ET), showing how mixed sentiment still is across the region. Crypto saw a modest surge too. After a wild week, Bitcoin ticked up 0.21%, landing at $118,368.56 by 12:16 p.m. Singapore time (12:15 a.m. ET). The gains weren‚Äôt explosive, but they were enough to keep bullish traders engaged.

2025-07-21T07:39:11,"Hoskinson Vows to Livestream ADA Audit Report as August Release Nears","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson says an audit of Input Output Global‚Äôs (IOG) ADA holdings is nearly ready for public release, with plans to livestream the full report once finalized. Key Takeaways: Charles Hoskinson says the audit of IOG‚Äôs ADA holdings is on track for a mid-August release. The audit follows serious allegations of $600M ADA misappropriation, which Hoskinson denies. Hoskinson plans legal action against accusers. In a recent post on X , Hoskinson said the report is ‚Äúshaping up quickly‚Äù after he requested more context and transparency in several key sections. ‚ÄúI believe we are on schedule for a mid-August release, assuming the work continues at this pace and there are no delays,‚Äù Hoskinson said Saturday. Hoskinson Faces Scrutiny Amid $600M ADA Misappropriation Allegations The audit follows a wave of accusations leveled earlier this year, including claims that Hoskinson misappropriated $600 million in ADA through manipulation of the Cardano ledger. One allegation, made by NFT artist Masato Alexander, accused Hoskinson of using a ‚Äúgenesis key‚Äù to seize control of $619 million during Cardano‚Äôs 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson has denied the allegations and said he was ‚Äúdeeply hurt‚Äù by the erosion of trust within the community. ‚ÄúIOG never gave itself 350 million unclaimed ADA. This is a lie,‚Äù he wrote in May. ‚ÄúThe vast majority was claimed, and the remaining that was forfeited after seven years of waiting was donated to Intersect.‚Äù Hoskinson pledged to make the audit public via a dedicated website and said the livestreamed reading would provide full transparency. The site will also include ‚Äúhistorical artifacts from the sale,‚Äù he added. Beyond the audit, Hoskinson is considering legal options against those who made the allegations. ‚ÄúMeeting with the defamation law firm next week to discuss options and strategy,‚Äù he said. Meeting with the defamation law firm next week to discuss options and strategy. ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 20, 2025 At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.8842, up by more than 5% over the past day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token is up more than 51% over the past month but still down by 73% compared to its all-time high of $3.10 registered in early 2021. Cardano Aims for DeFi Expansion with Stablecoin Talks Earlier this month, Hoskinson confirmed talks with Circle and Tether to bring stablecoins USDC and USDT to the Cardano network. While the Cardano community sees this as a bullish development, Hoskinson cautioned that adding stablecoins alone won‚Äôt revolutionize the ecosystem. Hoskinson argued that the presence of major stablecoins won‚Äôt ‚Äúmagically supercharge‚Äù Cardano‚Äôs DeFi space. Instead, he emphasized the need for foundational infrastructure and user adoption to grow the ecosystem beyond hype. IOG talks to Circle every 1-2 months and to Tether numerous times. The $100M stablecoin SWF + Bitcoin DeFi + thriving DeFi can bring in USDC and USDT. Or the Cardano Foundation can pay $23M and mint a bunch of liquidity, which they won't. (jump to 5m40s) #Cardano pic.twitter.com/i9YMB2cY8a ‚Äî St‚Ç≥ke with Pride SPO & DRep (@StakeWithPride) July 6, 2025 Last month, Hoskinson introduced Cardinal , a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin-native DeFi to Cardano. The protocol allows Bitcoin holders to access Cardano‚Äôs smart contracts and low fees, while maintaining BTC‚Äôs liquidity and trustless nature. Cardinal uses a non-custodial wrapping model built on MuSig2, HTLCs, and BitVMX to create wrapped BTC and Ordinals for lending, borrowing, and trading. These assets are pegged 1:1, transferable, and redeemable with fraud-proof mechanisms‚Äîavoiding rehypothecation and centralized custody risks. The protocol aims to bridge Bitcoin‚Äôs capital with Cardano‚Äôs programmability, and is compatible with other Layer 1 chains.

2025-07-21T07:30:24,"Bitcoin: H100‚Äôs Bold $1.5M Move to Boost Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: H100‚Äôs Bold $1.5M Move to Boost Holdings In the dynamic world of digital assets, a significant development is capturing the attention of investors and market observers alike: a Swedish health tech company, H100, has successfully raised 14.1 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to approximately $1.5 million, with the explicit purpose of acquiring more Bitcoin . This strategic move highlights a growing trend among corporations to integrate digital currencies into their treasury strategies, underscoring a deepening belief in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin . Currently holding 370 BTC, H100‚Äôs decision to further expand its digital asset portfolio signals a bold step in the evolving landscape of corporate finance. Bitcoin‚Äôs Growing Appeal: Why H100 is Investing Big? The recent capital raise by H100 for additional Bitcoin acquisition isn‚Äôt just a headline; it‚Äôs a testament to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, even within non-traditional sectors like health tech. What drives a company like H100, primarily focused on health innovation, to make such a substantial investment in Bitcoin ? The motivations are multifaceted and align with several key narratives surrounding digital assets: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currency values, companies are increasingly looking for assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin , often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù is seen by many as a robust hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Digital Gold Narrative: Similar to gold, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive store of value. Companies are diversifying their treasury reserves beyond traditional cash and bonds, viewing Bitcoin as a modern alternative. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Beyond short-term volatility, many institutional investors and corporations believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for significant long-term appreciation. They view current prices as an opportune entry point for future growth. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in Bitcoin provides diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by introducing an asset with a low correlation to traditional financial markets. H100‚Äôs move suggests a sophisticated understanding of these underlying drivers, positioning them not just as a health tech innovator but also as a forward-thinking entity in corporate finance. The Strategic Play: How H100‚Äôs Bitcoin Acquisition Fits In? For H100, this $1.5 million capital raise isn‚Äôt merely about buying more Bitcoin ; it‚Äôs about making a strategic statement and strengthening their financial foundation. The decision to publicly announce this intent, as reported by market observers, adds a layer of transparency and confidence to their digital asset strategy. Their existing holding of 370 BTC already places them among a select group of companies with significant cryptocurrency exposure. Expanding this position indicates: Commitment to Digital Assets: It signals a long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of their treasury strategy, rather than a speculative short-term venture. Confidence in Future Growth: By increasing their holdings, H100 is effectively voting with its capital on the future growth and stability of the Bitcoin network and ecosystem. Pioneering Spirit: While not the first, a health tech company making such a move sets a precedent within its industry, potentially encouraging others to explore similar avenues. Enhanced Financial Resilience: A diversified treasury, including a strong allocation to a perceived inflation-resistant asset like Bitcoin , can enhance a company‚Äôs financial resilience against macroeconomic shifts. This strategic allocation reflects a nuanced understanding of global economic trends and the potential for digital assets to play a crucial role in future corporate balance sheets. Examining the Trend: Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption the New Normal? H100‚Äôs latest fundraising round for Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a prominent example of a broader trend. Over the past few years, a growing number of publicly traded and private companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This shift represents a significant evolution in corporate finance, moving beyond traditional asset classes. However, this trend comes with its own set of considerations: Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Benefit Description Inflation Hedge Protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value A durable asset for long-term wealth preservation. Diversification Reduces portfolio risk by adding a non-correlated asset. Innovation & Future-Proofing Positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable to new financial paradigms. Potential Appreciation Opportunity for significant capital gains over time. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations, which can impact a company‚Äôs balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential compliance challenges. Custody and Security: Securely managing and storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by region, impacting financial reporting. Despite these challenges, the increasing institutional interest, coupled with the ongoing development of clearer regulatory frameworks and more secure custody solutions, suggests that corporate Bitcoin adoption may indeed be on its way to becoming a more normalized practice. Companies like H100 are at the forefront of this shift, demonstrating a willingness to navigate the complexities for perceived long-term gains. Looking Ahead: What Does H100‚Äôs Bitcoin Move Signal for the Future? The strategic decision by H100 to raise capital specifically for increasing its Bitcoin holdings sends a powerful signal to the market. It suggests that even companies outside the traditional financial sector are recognizing the intrinsic value and strategic importance of digital assets. This move could inspire other health tech firms, and indeed companies across various industries, to re-evaluate their treasury management strategies. For investors, H100‚Äôs actions provide another data point illustrating the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin . It underscores the idea that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is becoming a serious consideration for corporate treasuries looking to optimize their financial resilience and growth potential in an ever-changing global economy. This development is a clear indicator that the intersection of traditional business and the decentralized digital economy is rapidly expanding, paving the way for a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in corporate financial planning. In conclusion, H100‚Äôs successful $1.5 million capital raise to acquire more Bitcoin is a compelling story of strategic foresight and confidence in the digital asset space. It highlights the growing trend of corporate adoption, driven by a desire for inflation hedging, diversification, and long-term value appreciation. As more companies follow suit, the landscape of corporate finance is set to undergo a significant transformation, with Bitcoin increasingly recognized as a foundational asset for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is H100 and why are they investing in Bitcoin ? A1: H100 is a Swedish health tech company. They are investing in Bitcoin primarily to diversify their treasury assets, hedge against inflation, and capitalize on the potential for long-term value appreciation of the cryptocurrency.

Q3: Is it common for companies outside the tech sector to invest in Bitcoin ? A3: While still a relatively new trend, it is becoming increasingly common. Companies across various sectors, including health tech like H100, are exploring Bitcoin as part of their treasury management strategies, driven by its perceived benefits as a store of value and inflation hedge. Q4: What are the main risks associated with corporate Bitcoin holdings? A4: The primary risks include Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility, the evolving regulatory landscape, and the complexities associated with secure custody and accounting treatment of digital assets.

The total crypto market cap is nearing $4 trillion, driven by rising participation. Bitcoin is trading at $118,366, up slightly in the past 24 hours, while altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin are showing strong double-digit monthly gains . Despite positive developments like historic crypto bills , a tariff pause, and the Fed holding interest rates steady , some analysts warn of deeper issues forming beneath the surface. While many are preparing for a bull run, Robert Kiyosaki is preparing for a bubble burst, planning to buy more Bitcoin if prices crash. Here‚Äôs his famous Bubble Warning resurfacing again. Kiyosaki Sees All Bubble Burst Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again voiced his fears of an incoming financial meltdown. In a recent X post, he warned that multiple market bubbles are about to burst. He believes that this event will not only affect stocks but will also impact assets that are often seen as safe havens, including gold, silver, and Bitcoin. BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING. When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash‚Ä¶. I will be buying. Take care. ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 21, 2025 Earlier this year, Kiyosaki cheered Bitcoin‚Äôs new high above $120,000 but warned investors not to get greedy, using the phrase ‚ÄúPigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.‚Äù While he still believes in Bitcoin, gold, and silver long-term, he‚Äôs now sounding more cautious, hinting that even strong supporters are growing concerned about short-term risks as prices keep climbing. US Debt Adds to the Pressure His warning comes at a time when the US national debt has surged past $34.9 trillion. Interest payments alone are becoming one of the largest government expenses, raising serious concerns about the sustainability of the current financial system. Many believe this ballooning debt could trigger wider instability and deepen the impact of any market crash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Responds to ADA Misappropriation Claims with IOG Transparency Audit , Buy the Dip: Crypto May Fall Before It Rises Kiyosaki says that when the bubble pops, most asset classes, including crypto, could face a sharp correction. Even Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, may not be immune. However, he does not view this as a negative outcome. Instead, he sees it as a rare chance to accumulate gold, silver, and Bitcoin at lower prices, expecting a strong recovery in the long run. $BTC is getting ready for a big move Bitcoin is moving inside a triangle pattern and staying above strong support around $116,000 to $117,000.

It‚Äôs stuck in a triangle pattern, holding strong above $116K support while facing downward pressure. If it breaks upward, it could shoot to $125K , but if support fails, it might drop to $111K.

2025-07-21T07:14:35,"XRP begins the week bullish, targets a new ATH: check forecast","July is shaping up to be one of the most bullish months for the crypto market this year. The market has opened bullish for the third consecutive week, with altcoins performing excellently. Bitcoin, the leading crypto by market cap, has been consolidating around the $118k level over the past few days. Ether hit the $3,800 mark a few hours ago while Dogecoin leads the charge. XRP has also opened the week bullish and could target a new all-time high over the next few hours or days. XRP finds key support level at $3.40 XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, is one of the best performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours. The coin is up 3.5% during that period and now trades at $3.535. The positive performance comes as the broader crypto market remains extremely bullish. XRP added over 20% to its value last week, hitting a high of $3.66 for the first time in roughly eight years. XRP slightly dropped over the weekend, establishing a strong support level around $3.40. The hopes of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the resolution of Ripple‚Äôs case with the SEC are crucial to the inflow of institutional funds into the XRP market. Furthermore, the passing of the GENIUS Act last week was a net positive for US-based crypto projects. The regulatory clarity in the country could increase cryptocurrency adoption, resulting in higher prices for XRP and other leading coins. XRP targets a new all-time high The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bullish but inefficient, suggesting that the coin could dip lower before rallying higher. The technical indicators are bullish following XRP‚Äôs rally over the last few days. The RSI of 66 shows that XRP is currently bullish, but not in the overbought region, indicating further room for growth. The MACD lines are also in the bullish region, suggesting a bullish bias. With XRP establishing strong support at $3,40, it could extend the rally toward last week‚Äôs high of $3.66. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP‚Äôs all-time high is $3.84, which it reached in January 2018. A successful close above last week‚Äôs high will extend the rally toward its 141.40% Fibonacci extension level at $4.10, drawn from the January high of $3.40 to the April low of $1.61. However, the market has been extremely bullish over the past few weeks and could experience some selling pressure. If that happens, XRP faces a correction and a retest of the $3.40 support level. An extended bearish run would see XRP drop to the Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) level at $3.168 over the coming hours or days.

2025-07-21T07:12:35,"Ether, Dogecoin Lead Capital Rotation Away From Bitcoin as Altcoin Fever Resurges","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered just under $120,000 in Asia trading hours Monday, up 1% on the day and 2.6% on the week, even as traders increasingly shifted capital into altcoins like ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana‚Äôs SOL (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE). The market rotation comes as institutional flows broaden beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum-led narratives gaining momentum and real-world asset tokenization drawing fresh attention from traditional finance players. ETH surged to $3,793, posting a 3.7% daily gain and up 25% over the week. It‚Äôs now at its highest level since early 2022, and analysts say demand from new ETH-based treasury products and ongoing ETF flows are fueling the rally. XRP followed suit, rising 4.1% to $3.55, while SOL added 6.6% to reach $189. Cardano‚Äôs ADA) and BNB Coin (BNB) both gained over 3% on the day. Dogecoin (DOGE) stood out with a 9.6% jump in the past 24 hours, trading at 27 cents and up more than 33% on the week ‚Äî its strongest performance in over a year. ""Over the past week, altcoins have shown signs of taking the spotlight, with Bitcoin stalling just below recent all-time highs and capital rotating into broader market plays,"" said Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken, in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin dominance has dropped from a June peak of 66% to around 61.75%, signaling early signs of an altcoin cycle heading into Q3,"" Cardozo said. The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been in decline for some time, has seen a strong bounce back to its best levels since Q1 ‚Äî a sign that traders are again betting on Ethereum outperforming. ""Some will credit the stablecoin and RWA narrative,"" said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. ""But we think it‚Äôs just good old-fashioned risk-on spillover. Most TradFi players are already fully positioned on BTC."" Beyond technical positioning, macro and legislative tailwinds continue to shape the altcoin trade. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and increase clarity around digital asset taxation, failed a procedural vote earlier this week but is still progressing in U.S. Congress. ""Ethereum and other altcoins are surging due to institutional demand and friendly legislative policies,"" said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at OSL. ""Traders are hoping to see Ethereum break to new all-time highs, the last of the majors yet to do so in this cycle."" Meanwhile, the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector ‚Äî now over $24 billion in total tokenized value ‚Äî is becoming a serious institutional theme. Projects tokenizing private credit, Treasuries, and real estate are attracting fresh attention from giants like BlackRock and JPMorgan. ""Tokenized assets are taking a meaningful share of DeFi TVL,"" Cardozo added. ""It may be too early to call an altseason, but the rotation is real. If BTC consolidates, altcoins tied to real-world finance could lead the next leg,‚Äù he ended.

2025-07-21T07:04:28,"JPMorgan Chase Says Stock Market Going ‚ÄòMeaningfully‚Äô Higher in 12 Months Amid Resilient Corporate America","Banking giant JPMorgan Chase believes that the US stock market is not finished rallying and will hit much higher levels in the coming months. In a new CNBC Television interview, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jordan Jackson says the bank does not expect the US to witness a recession in the next 12 months. The market strategist also believes that during the period, the stock market will print new all-time highs. ‚ÄúMarkets do appear to be, as we flirt with all-time highs, sort of sanguine over the very, very near term. But that being said, I would say over the next 12 months, I think markets are going to be higher than where they are today, probably meaningfully so.‚Äù Jackson adds that Corporate America has been able to effectively navigate the uncertainty brought about by Trump‚Äôs shifting trade policies, solidifying his expectations of a stock market bull run. ‚ÄúThe word I would describe for the earnings backdrop is ‚Äòresilient.‚Äô Companies came into this period of [uncertainty], really did a lot of cost-cutting measures, whether that would be reducing workforce or putting freezes on hiring, really working with their suppliers to either bear the brunt or have some of their foreign suppliers bear the brunt of higher tariffs. I think when you look at the broader backdrop, you‚Äôve got to look at resiliency in some of the earnings. And I think we‚Äôll see that in some of the tech earnings that we get over the course of [this] week. This question will be is forward guidance. What are they signaling over the next couple of quarters? We continue to hear a more cautious tone from CEOs with the expectation that the economy is going to begin to slow over the second half of this year. So it would be interesting to see what kind of forward guidance we get that informs our earnings expectations for the tail end of this year.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-21T07:00:55,"XRP Targets $6‚Äì$10 If Bitcoin Hits $144,000, Analyst Predicts","Pseudonymous market technician Dr‚ÄØCat has laid out a tightly argued roadmap that would see XRP triple from its current range to between six and ten dollars within the next two months‚Äîprovided Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing advance carries the benchmark asset to $144,000. XRP Poised For $10 If This Happens In a series of posts over the weekend, the analyst noted that XRP‚Äôs monthly chart against BTC is ‚Äúcoiling‚Äù just beneath a crucial Ichimoku Cloud threshold at 2,674‚ÄØsatoshis. ‚ÄúIf this month closes above‚ÄØ2‚ÄØ674 I think we should go at least to‚ÄØ4‚ÄØ135 in the next couple of months,‚Äù Dr‚ÄØCat wrote, adding that such a close would deliver the first bullish monthly‚ÄØkumo twist for the pair since 2018 and place XRP in a ‚Äúsupport‚Äëand‚Äëregain‚Äù configuration rarely seen in altcoins during the current cycle. The 4,135‚Äì7,600‚ÄØsatoshi band marks what Dr‚ÄØCat calls the ‚Äúresistance / take‚Äëprofit zone.‚Äù He argues that price seldom reloads immediately after such a multi‚Äëyear breakout and that a wick to the upper end of the zone is likely once momentum ignites. Related Reading: Analyst Says You Should Be Preparing To Exit XRP ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why ‚ÄúAll in all, if‚ÄØBTC goes to‚ÄØ144‚ÄØK on this weekly move, this price range for‚ÄØXRP in‚ÄØUSD translates to‚ÄØ$6‚Äì$10,‚Äù the analyst told followers, pencilling the move in for August or September if Bitcoin‚Äôs trend steepens. Dr‚ÄØCat conceded that the optimal risk‚Äëreward evaporates above 7,600‚ÄØsats‚Äî‚ÄúWould you risk a 10√ó unrealised gain for another 0.7√ó?‚Äù‚Äîand said he would rotate out of the position even though longer‚Äëterm targets above $30 remain ‚Äúplausible‚Äù into 2026. On the XRP‚ÄëUSD chart the picture is similarly constructive. Sunday‚Äôs weekly close above $3.37 turned both the cloud and the Kijun‚Äësen higher and produced a textbook Chikou Span breakout in week‚ÄØ27 of the Ichimoku time cycle, the so‚Äëcalled Henka‚ÄëBi candle. Dr‚ÄØCat‚Äôs price‚Äëprojection grid aligns traditional Fibonacci extensions with Ichimoku price‚Äëmeasurement theory: the N‚Äëwave objective sits at $4.53, the E‚Äëwave at $6.31 and the 2E extension at $9.22. ‚ÄúWith the condition of this weekly close all of them are on the table for the next one to two months and‚ÄØ$4.5 should be the absolute minimum,‚Äù he wrote, recalling that the same $4.5 target had been floated as ‚Äúminimum‚Äù when XRP traded at $1.89 in early April. Market context lends partial support to the thesis. Bitcoin is trading just above $118,500 after a subdued weekend session, consolidating a 20‚ÄØpercent rally since the start of July, while ether holds near $3,760 and dominance continues to erode in favour of large‚Äëcap altcoins. XRP itself is hovering around $3.55 following a 50‚Äëpercent weekly burst. Related Reading: XRP To $13 in 40 Days? Analyst Predicts Explosive Final Rally Technically, the ‚Äúmonthly close above 2,674‚ÄØsats‚Äù remains the gating criterion. A failure to secure that level would postpone the kumo twist and risk another quarter of range‚Äëbound drift versus Bitcoin. Conversely, a decisive move into the 4,135‚Äì7,600‚ÄØsatoshi band would confirm the first bullish market‚Äëstructure shift on the long‚Äëterm ratio chart in seven years and almost certainly drive speculative flows into the XRP‚ÄëUSD pair. Traders watching for additional confirmation will be tracking whether the Chikou Span can clear price on the weekly timeframe ‚Äúthis or next week‚Äù‚Äîa rare but powerful signal that the analyst warns could invalidate the ‚Äúhealthy cross‚Äù caveat and send the market vertical even before the textbook Tenkan‚ÄëKijun crossover materialises. For now, the path to $6‚Äì$10 hinges on Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to extend its breakout toward the six‚Äëfigure mark. If the flagship asset stalls below $120,000 the proportional upside for XRP compresses; should the rally continue, Dr‚ÄØCat‚Äôs stacked Ichimoku‚ÄëFibonacci objectives argue that $4.5 comes first, $6 follows quickly and the fabled $10 print is finally ‚Äúon the table‚Äù as the trifecta of cloud twist, time‚Äëcycle symmetry and momentum converge. At press time, XRP traded at $3.55.
