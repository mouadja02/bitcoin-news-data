2025-07-21T11:53:40,"‚Äú1 BTC Per Day‚Äù Is Over: IMF Reveals El Salvador Halted Bitcoin Buys Since February","El Salvador has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February 2025, according to a new report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on July 15. The disclosure directly contradicts President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs long-standing public claim that his government has been buying one Bitcoin per day. The IMF‚Äôs findings were included in the first formal review of the country‚Äôs Bitcoin program since El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion loan agreement in December 2024. IMF Lauds El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin Reforms, Confirms Policy Shift A letter signed by Central Bank President Douglas Pablo Rodr√≠guez Fuentes and Finance Minister Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina confirmed that ‚Äúthe stock of Bitcoins held by the public sector remains unchanged.‚Äù The IMF report also revealed that El Salvador is moving to scale back its public involvement in Bitcoin-related services. One of the key changes includes reducing the role of the Chivo wallet, the state-backed digital asset platform, and ultimately ending its operation by July 2025. The Chivo wallet, once promoted as a centerpiece of the country‚Äôs Bitcoin adoption, will be shut down from public control, and the IMF clarified that while the wallet will remain operational, it must be fully privatized and no longer run on government funds. The report noted that although on-chain activity shows BTC moving between wallets, these are not new acquisitions. Instead, the transactions reflect internal transfers between cold and hot wallets. The IMF emphasized that these movements had led to a ‚Äúmisinterpretation‚Äù of El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin activity. Officials further argue that reallocated reserves or assets obtained through legal seizures do not qualify as state-backed Bitcoin buys. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office , El Salvador currently holds about 6,244 BTC, worth roughly $742 million. While some reports suggested an 8 BTC increase last week, the IMF attributes this to technical accounting, not fresh buys. El Salvador has approved amendments to its Bitcoin laws, aligning with a deal struck with the IMF to scale back its crypto exposure. #ElSalvador #Bitcoin https://t.co/2BDlo3RCGg ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 30, 2025 The IMF praised the updated Bitcoin policy for reducing fiscal risk and strengthening transparency. It said these steps were helping to stabilize inflation and restore macroeconomic stability in the country. Official vs. On-Chain: The Bitcoin Mystery Behind El Salvador‚Äôs Treasury Despite growing public interest in sovereign Bitcoin reserves, the IMF is pushing El Salvador to treat BTC as a financial asset with risk exposure, not as a currency. As part of the agreement, Bitcoin is no longer considered mandatory legal tender. While the Salvadoran government insists it is still ‚Äústacking sats,‚Äù the IMF‚Äôs statement indicates otherwise. The divergence in interpretation has added fuel to a broader debate around sovereign BTC holdings. President Nayib Bukele recently clarified that El Salvador won‚Äôt stop its BTC accumulating strategy. #ElSalvador #BitcoinReserve #NayibBukele https://t.co/EJ4m8VOxYs ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Some blockchain analysts, including firms like Arkham, have observed steady 1 BTC per day transfers from exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex to addresses reportedly linked to the Salvadoran government. Still, whether these are official purchases or private transactions remains unclear. Other governments and companies continue to expand their Bitcoin treasuries. Japan‚Äôs Metaplanet recently acquired 797 Bitcoin for $93.6 million . On Tuesday, the firm announced plans to purchase a digital bank to expand its crypto services. Meanwhile, The Blockchain Group in France and the UK‚Äôs Smarter Web Company added over 340 BTC combined . Strategy, the first Bitcoin treasury company, posted $14 billion in unrealized gains in Q2 2025 . Compared to this international trend, El Salvador‚Äôs quiet pause signals a shift. The IMF is scheduled to conduct further reviews in September and December 2025 to track compliance. For now, El Salvador‚Äôs public BTC balance appears to be holding steady, with no new government-funded purchases. The IMF says the country is sticking to its agreement. The Bukele administration says otherwise. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price nearing record highs, the divide between official reporting and on-chain speculation is likely to grow. The next few months may prove decisive in shaping the future of sovereign crypto strategy.

Although the Ethereum price maintained a sluggish trend before, it gained huge bullish momentum and broke above the local threshold of $3800. This seems to have attracted the retailers who were offshore till now, as institutions constantly accumulated Bitcoin, which kept up the bullish momentum. Now that the BTC price rally seems to have cooled a bit, altcoins have gained traction, igniting a strong Altseason. Retailers Returning to the Market Bitcoin has manifested significant strength after undergoing a breakout during Q4, 2024. The dominance surged, which hinted towards a massive influx of liquidity to the star token. Meanwhile, the trend changed as the BTC price marked new highs as the liquidity flow seemed to have started from Bitcoin to Ethereum. As a result, the ETH price has started to rise, which has attracted significant attention from the retailers. The above chart shows the search trend of the term ‚ÄòAltcoins‚Äô which has risen significantly since the start of the month. The queries related to Altseason, memecoins, and tokens like Solana, XRP, Binance Coin, Avalanche and Uniswap have been on a constant rise. This u-shaped recovery suggests the retailers are gaining huge interest in the altcoins, and hence the altcoin season or the AltSeason, could be nearby. When Will the Altseason Begin? Which Altcoins Should You Stack? The momentum is slowly shifting hard towards altcoins, but the full-blown altseason signal isn‚Äôt confirmed just yet. The indices and BTC dominance are close but not quite at the textbook trigger levels. Google searches for ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô are spiking alongside retail FOMO, and the Altcoin Season Index‚Äôs jump to 51 reflects a real uptick in speculative appetite. The historical numbers suggest the Altseason get intensified when the altcoin season index reaches 71 and sustains above 75. This suggests the altcoins are yet to rise; however, the altcoin market cap reclaimed key trendlines, and Glassnode data is flashing early rotation. Moreover, social feeds are buzzing with memecoins and narrative trades, which may also end up with a sharp correction. Google trends usually reflect the investors mindset, which is very important to determine whether Bitcoin or the other sectors of the crypto market are gaining traction. Now, when ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô are gaining attention, it indicates that the retail is waking up and FOMO is brewing. However, a strong Altseason may get in place once the Ethereum price could rise and sustain above $4000 which has been a huge milestone. With this, the ETH price rally to a new ATH could be imminent, which could further push the altcoin season index above 75, kick-starting a strong AltSeason 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/retail-is-returning-to-crypto-with-altcoins-gaining-strength-heres-when-altseason-may-get-started/,"ALTCOIN|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ETH","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The total crypto market capitalization has climbed to $3.94 trillion, up 1.17%. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume stands at $196.07 billion, marking a significant 43% surge. The Fear & Greed Index reads a greed-driven score of 67. And the altcoin season index scores 57, confirming rising altcoin strength. A major catalyst is the regulatory breakthrough that has energized the altcoin market, evidenced by Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance falling from 63.76% to 60%. Moreover, the altcoin cap reclaiming an 8-year trendline. Curious about where the blue-chip coins are heading next? Read this Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction for short-term targets Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin is showing signs of strength despite a 2.53% dip over the past week, currently trading at $118,681.99. This setup, combined with strong ETF demand and BlockInc‚Äôs recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index, signals rising institutional confidence. Talking about trade, the volume has jumped nearly 40% in the last 24 hours, supporting the possibility of a breakout. If Bitcoin can close above the short-term resistance at $119,700, it could target $121,200. However, if the bullish pattern fails to hold, a downside move toward $115,000 could come into play. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum continues to outperform BTC, climbing over 23% in the past seven days and now changing hands at $3,776.02. On the chart, ETH is hovering just below short-term resistance at $3,820. This move is underpinned by a record-breaking $2.12 billion in weekly ETF inflows, which is an ATH. The RSI remains comfortably bullish but not overheated, while rising trading volume confirms the strength behind the move. If Ethereum price breaks above $3,820 , it is likely to surge toward $4,096 in the coming days. Contrarily, if the rally stalls, support levels at $3,680 and $3,550 could catch any pullbacks and offer fresh long opportunities. Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP has maintained a solid uptrend over the past week, gaining 18.59% and currently priced at $3.53. The token is trading just under the key resistance level at $3.60, which has capped upward momentum several times this year. However, the recent signing of the GENIUS Act by President Trump has invigorated market sentiment around Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem and stablecoin integration, driving institutional inflows. On the technical front, XRP is flashing a bullish RSI at 84. A clean breakout above $3.60 could push the XRP price toward $3.75, and then to $4.004 . If it fails to break this barrier, XRP may retest $3.42, with firmer support resting at $3.30. That being said, a cascade of sell-offs could bring the price to $2.882. FAQs Why is Bitcoin consolidating near ATH instead of surging? Bitcoin is digesting previous gains and consolidating within a bullish pattern. Why is Ethereum price going up? A historic $2.12B inflow into ETH ETFs is driving bullish sentiment. Technical indicators support further upside, with a target nearing $4,000. What is XRP price today?

The Layer 1 powerhouse stormed past the $190 mark and now trades at $191.10 USD, posting a strong 6.25% gain in the past 24 hours. Trading volume soared to $8.18‚ÄØbillion, and its market cap cracked $102.82‚ÄØbillion, cementing Solana‚Äôs place among the crypto elite. Bitcoin and Ethereum laid the groundwork. Bitcoin is quietly holding steady at $118,773, with a massive $2.36‚ÄØtrillion market cap. Ethereum remains strong at $3,781.27, backed by a $455‚ÄØbillion cap. But among altcoins, Solana caught the brightest spark,and it lit up fast. Short Squeeze Frenzy: $11M Liquidated The rally wasn‚Äôt without casualties. Over $11‚ÄØmillion in short positions were liquidated as SOL surged through $191. The biggest single liquidation? A $1.13 million position torched at $188. Bears didn‚Äôt just bleed,they were blindsided. Funding rates flipped aggressive. Margin calls rang out across major exchanges. The message was clear: don‚Äôt fade Solana when it‚Äôs on a tear. Inflows Accelerate as Institutions Circle Investor interest surged alongside the price. Solana-based investment vehicles,from ETPs to ETFs,saw $39.1‚ÄØmillion in net inflows last week. While Bitcoin-focused products dominated the spotlight with $2.19‚ÄØbillion in inflows, Solana‚Äôs slice of the pie is growing fast. The demand for smart contract ecosystems is real,and rising. Liquidity Deepens, Ecosystem Glows Exchanges saw order books swell as buyers stacked up walls at key levels. Solana‚Äôs $8.18 billion turnover was one of the highest in recent memory. On-chain metrics followed the price: Daily active addresses surged Network fees ticked up Developer commits increased The Solana ecosystem didn‚Äôt just rally,it activated. Social Media Erupts The crypto community noticed. CryptoRank tracked the action SolanaFloor shows the liquidations Biggest blow-ups? Right here as well Feeds were filled with liquidation charts, bullish takes, and whale sightings. The buzz is back. Technicals Say: $200 in Sight for SOL? SOL blasted through the $180 resistance with confidence. Momentum indicators now flash bullish: RSI remains strong Moving averages have flipped to support Trendlines slope upward Eyes are now locked on the next milestone: $200. But seasoned traders are also watching support zones around $175 and $160, just in case the rally takes a breather. Macro Backdrop: Crypto‚Äôs Risk-On Mood The bigger picture helps too. Bitcoin stays strong above $118K. Ethereum is firm around $3,800. U.S. regulators are softening tone on ETF approvals. Risk appetite is cautiously returning to markets. Traditional capital is sniffing around crypto again,and Solana‚Äôs performance is hard to ignore. Fundamentals: Fast, Cheap, and Busy Solana continues to flex: Processes 50,000+ TPS Average fees below $0.01 DeFi volume is climbing NFT activity is resurgent New projects launch daily. The chain‚Äôs momentum isn‚Äôt just price-driven,it‚Äôs usage-driven. Whales Accumulate Solana, Exchanges Drain Whale wallets are swelling. The number of addresses holding 1,000+ SOL increased last week. At the same time, exchange reserves dropped, pointing to accumulation and long-term conviction. Supply is quietly drying up on trading platforms. Solana‚Äôs breakout isn‚Äôt just a spike, it‚Äôs a statement. From a once-dismissed altcoin to a market leader, SOL has climbed its way into the conversation alongside the big names. Yes, the volatility remains. Yes, corrections can sting. But for now, Solana is roaring. It‚Äôs at $191 today. The only question left is,where‚Äôs it going next? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin is near $120,000 and Ethereum trades above $3,500. At around $3.60, XRP looks easier on the wallet yet still sits third in market cap.

Retail investors are quick to react when legal clouds clear one way or the other. Holder Base Dominated By Small Players Based on the XRP Rich List, nearly 6.7 million wallets hold the token today. Of those, about 5.7 million belong to retail investors‚Äîaccounts with under 1,000 XRP. Within that group, close to 3 million wallets have between 0 and 20 tokens, while 2.52 million wallets carry between 20 and 500. This broad distribution shows that everyday buyers have already jumped in, rather than just big institutions. According to several market watchers, excitement in the XRP community is palpable. Analysts predicted more XRP millionaires than Bitcoin millionaires. Many holders believe the token is still in its early days despite its 2012 debut. Critics warn that runaway optimism can reverse fast if the broader market cools down.

And no, it‚Äôs not just riding the $BTC wave. This slick new hustle is being dubbed the ‚ÄúInfinite Money Glitch.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the cheat code: a company raises capital, either by selling shares or locking in loans.Then, it plows that cash into crypto, pumping its balance sheet and juicing the stock price in the process. With the market hyped and the stock flying, it raises even more money. Rinse. Repeat. Such a shift sets the stage for the best altcoins to buy , like Bitcoin ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Conflux ($CFX), because they offer real utility beyond speculation. Altcoin Stocks Explode Over 226% in 30 Days Wall Street‚Äôs old tricks still work‚Äîthey‚Äôve just been upgraded for the crypto era. Debt, stock offerings, clever contracts‚Ä¶ those same tools that fueled traditional gains are now being pointed straight at digital assets. One of the OGs of this play is Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Back in 2020, they made headlines by going all in on $BTC‚Äînot just as a hedge, but as a profit engine. And they didn‚Äôt stop. Even today, Strategy keeps the flywheel spinning: sell shares, issue debt, scoop up more $BTC. It‚Äôs a rinse-and-repeat model that‚Äôs transformed the company into one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the planet. As of now, Strategy holds ~601,550 $BTC, valued at ~$70.94B, with an average purchase price of ~$71,290 per $BTC. Its holdings are up by 65.41% all-time, representing a whopping ~$28B gain. Other companies have also noticed the benefits of holding crypto and copied similar strategies, not just using $BTC, but altcoins like $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP. For instance, SharpLink Gaming is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, currently holding over 280K $ETH, worth around $1B. It recently increased its authorized stock sale limit by $5B , from $1B to $6B, and plans to use most of that capital to buy more $ETH. According to Animoca Brands‚Äô research, when a company announces it is adding altcoins to its balance sheet, its stock prices jump by ~161% on average on the same day. The next day, they were still up ~150%, over 185% after a week, and 226% thirty days later. Those are massive returns in a short period, so it‚Äôs no wonder investors are taking notice of altcoins. And for altcoins that set themselves apart with real-world use cases and active communities, such as $HYPER , $BEST , and $CFX, this could be a major boost. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì Targets Faster, Cheaper Transactions & DeFi Utility on Bitcoin by Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is making waves in the altcoin space with the upcoming launch of its Bitcoin Layer 2 network, set to support smart contracts in Q3 2025. The project‚Äôs ultimate mission is to unlock real utility for Bitcoin by enabling secure Web3 integration, super-fast transactions, and greater scalability. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , the Layer 2 aims to make wrapped $BTC usable across dApps, DeFi tools, DAOs, NFTs, and other blockchain-based experiences that Ethereum has traditionally dominated. It will also include a Canonical Bridge for fast and secure transfers between Bitcoin‚Äôs L1 and its L2, without compromising security or performance. Signaling growing confidence in the Layer 2‚Äôs vision, $HYPER has raised over $3.9M on presale, with major contributions from crypto whales ( $74.9K , $54.1, and $53.9K !). $HYPER also attracts attention to granting holders lower gas fees, governance rights, and sizable staking rewards ‚Äì currently at a 241% APY. You can buy $HYPER on presale for just $0.01235. The L2 mainnet launch could push it to $0.32 , making now a great time to get involved for possible returns exceeding 2,400%. 2. Best Wallet ($BEST) ‚Äì Raises $14M+ on Presale Ahead of Major Crypto Wallet Upgrades Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already raised over $14M on presale over being the foundation of the Best Wallet app ‚Äì a non-custodial crypto wallet designed for speed, privacy, and powerful Web3 access. Built for both crypto degens and professionals, Best Wallet allows users to manage their crypto without requiring KYC verification , making it the #1 anonymous crypto wallet . The app currently supports top chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, with plans to expand to over 60 networks. By doing so, you can manage your assets across multiple chains without juggling different platforms and wallets. With built-in tools for buying, storing, swapping, staking, and tracking over 1K digital assets, it delivers a seamless, all-in-one experience with real-time insights and customization. Fiat onramps are integrated through Onramper, offering top-tier exchange rates and low fees. And soon, it‚Äôll also launch Best Card, a crypto debit card facilitating easy daily crypto spending. And it doesn‚Äôt end there. Best Wallet has much to look forward to, including an NFT gallery, market intelligence analytics, and gas-free token transactions. To unlock the wallet‚Äôs full potential, you can buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025365. Then, enjoy reduced fees, exclusive access to the best crypto presales, and higher staking rewards at a 97% APY. Upcoming app developments and exchange listings could potentially drive its price to $0.072 this year, resulting in returns of over 183%. Given that it also has strong backing from crypto whales ‚Äì three of which injected $49.5K , $25K , and $18.7K into the project ‚Äì Best Wallet‚Äôs momentum shows no signs of dwindling. 3. Conflux ($CFX) ‚Äì Soars 105% Ahead of Network Upgrade & Yuan-Pegged Stablecoin Launch Conflux ($CFX) is a China-based Layer 1 blockchain designed to connect creators, communities, and markets across different protocols ‚Äì all with a major focus on scalability and security. $CFX, its native token used for transactions, staking, and governance, is up by over 105% this week. It jumped to $0.2405 following big announcements, including the Conflux 3.0 upgrade and the release of $AxCNH, a new stablecoin pegged to Chinese yuan. The upcoming launch of Conflux 3.0 will handle an impressive 15K transactions per second. Beyond faster performance, it‚Äôs designed to support real-world asset transfers and cross-border payments on the blockchain. Meanwhile, the $AxCNH stablecoin will facilitate cross-border payments across Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Both of these developments are set to launch in August, making it a potentially ideal time to purchase $CFX on top crypto exchanges , such as MEXC , OKX , and Binance . Verdict ‚Äì Wall Street Brings Top Altcoins Into the Spotlight Wall Street‚Äôs crypto adoption has expanded beyond $BTC into altcoins like $ETH and $XRP. With traditional financial strategies like stock sales being used to accumulate digital assets, a new phase of crypto accumulation is underway. Altcoins like $HYPER , $BEST , and $CFX are positioned to benefit from the renewed altcoin interest. This is because they offer real utility, whether it be through Bitcoin scaling, multi-chain access, or high-speed cross-border infrastructure. This isn‚Äôt investment advice.

OKX Removes BADGER, BAL, and NIL USDT Perpetual Contracts According to the official statement made by the company, perpetual contracts for the following three USDT trading pairs will be terminated as of 16:00 on July 25, 2025: BADGER/USDT BAL/USDT NIL/USDT On that date, trading of these contracts will be suspended, all pending orders will be canceled, and users' open positions will be surrendered based on the arithmetic average of the last hour's OKX index prices.

2025-07-21T11:19:30,"Is Solana (SOL) Poised for a Major Turnaround? Price Analysis","It‚Äôs been a long time coming, but Solana (SOL) is finally making a decent move to the upside. How high can this $SOL pump go? Is $SOL about to take over the reins from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? $SOL price nears top of rising wedge - pullback? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $SOL reveals a nice rise inside an ascending wedge, which has taken out the $184 resistance. However, caution should certainly be employed from here. Given that the price has reached the top of the wedge, and the indicators on the Stochastic RSI are at the top, this could be an ideal place for a pullback. Whether the pullback will just take the price back to the bottom of the wedge, and the $184 resistance level, in order to confirm this as support, remains to be seen. Retest of $184 level is favourite to take place Source: TradingView The daily chart illustrates that an all-important higher high has just been made by $SOL bulls. However, it does look more obvious in this time frame that a retest of $184 will need to take place before the price can go higher. The indicator lines for the Stochastic RSI may come back down to the 80.00 level at least, and could then bounce back up again, signalling continued buying. $SOL W pattern on 2-week chart Source: TradingView Zooming much further out into the 2-week view, this chart looks excellent for the longer term prognosis for $SOL . All looks as though it hinges on $SOL bulls being able to claim the $184 resistance level as support. If they can do so, a W chart pattern would be likely to play out, potentially taking the $SOL price above the last $252 resistance. SOL/ETH turnaround about to take place? Source: TradingView Finally, if one looks at the SOL/ETH chart, could a turnaround be about to take place? $ETH has dominated in a big way over the last several weeks, with a 43% increase in its ratio to $SOL. Is this turnaround currently taking place, or is $SOL just confirming the breakdown of the broadening wedge? The fact that the indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI may be about to flip bullish for $SOL is a potential big factor in the $SOL bulls‚Äô favour. Also, around 75% of all crypto transactions are taking place on the Solana network, whilst a much smaller percentage is on the Ethereum network or its layer 2s. Faster and cheaper, to a huge extent, may be what wins out for Solana over the longer term. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-21T11:15:00,"Altcoin Season Returns as Ether Treasuries Surge, BTC Dominance Slips: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Altcoin season, a period marked by notable outperformance of ether (ETH) and other alternative cryptocurrencies relative to bitcoin (BTC), may finally be upon us. That's the message from CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index, which has crossed above 50 for the first time since December. Ether and other layer-1 coins could be standout performers as a result of the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. The Act provides regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance that could draw institutional demand to Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains that host billions of dollars worth of the tokens. ""Treasuries are looking to ETH and other L1's such as SOL, XRP and ADA to become what BTC is to the likes of Strategy and Metaplanet,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said. Already, companies including SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have said they plan to build ether treasuries in the way Strategy has with bitcoin. Together they hold more than 500,000 ETH. And just today, newly established The Ether Machine said it plans to go public with a 400,000 ETH treasury. The trend will likely accelerate if U.S. regulators approve BlackRock's plan to add staking to its spot ether ETF. Staking could enhance ether's appeal as an internet bond, prompting some funds to shift from bitcoin ETFs to ether ETFs. Technical charts tied to cross-pairs, such as ETH/BTC and XRP/BTC, are already hinting at big rallies ahead. Speaking of bitcoin, its momentum has weakened since early last week, leaving prices directionless near $120,000. That's led to a sharp decline in its share of the crypto market. ""The fall in Bitcoin dominance is a major technical and psychological shift, suggesting a structural rotation into altcoins is underway,"" Valentine Fournier, lead analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""This transition is happening in the context of still-strong ETF flows, growing institutional participation, and the absence of any macro headwinds."" Still, on-chain activity continues to paint a bullish picture. According to Glassnode, wallets of all sizes are back in a BTC accumulation mode. ""Even >10K BTC whales are participating at levels last seen in Dec 2024. The alignment across wallet sizes suggests broad-based conviction behind the current BTC uptrend,"" Glassnode said on X. In key news, a report by Barron's said the U.S. public pension giant OPERS disclosed in its Q2 2025 13F filing that it increased its holdings by 171,441 shares in Palantir and 21,499 shares in bitcoin holder Strategy. In traditional markets, the yen, a risk-off currency, strengthened after Japan's ruling coalition lost the Upper House Election , leading to political uncertainty. Stay alert!

The weekend rally was sparked by a Conflux-hosted event in Shanghai, where the team unveiled a new stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan and the forthcoming Conflux 3.0 upgrade. The developments that were amplified by Chinese state media, lending credibility and national exposure. Trading volume exploded to $1.7 billion over 24 hours, a sharp jump from under $60 million just two days prior, as Asian traders flooded into the token amid speculation Conflux could benefit from increased regional adoption. With a market cap now above $1.09 billion, CFX has reentered the top 120 cryptocurrencies by size, marking a dramatic comeback for the project often referred to as ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Ethereum‚Äù in crypto circles. The new stablecoin, developed in partnership with AnchorX and Eastcompeace Technology, will be pegged to the offshore yuan (CNH) and targeted at cross-border payments along China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) corridors ‚Äî a niche that aligns with the Beijing government‚Äôs strategic priorities. The upgrade, scheduled for August, promises throughput of up to 15,000 transactions per second (TPS) and aims to support real-world asset issuance and cross-border settlement use cases, positioning the network as a potential infrastructure layer for China-linked Web3 applications. This isn‚Äôt the first time Conflux has rallied on China-aligned headlines; the token previously spiked on news of a partnership with China Telecom to develop blockchain-enabled SIM cards and past collaborations with McDonald‚Äôs China and the Shanghai government on metaverse pilots. Conflux continues to differentiate itself by marketing as ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs only regulatory-compliant public chain‚Äù, making it a recurring favorite among traders seeking geopolitical narratives and localized infrastructure bets within the crypto space. Derivatives Positioning BTC futures open interest holds steady at 700K BTC as growing investor interest in ether pushes its futures open interest to a record high of 15.21 million ETH. Annualized perpetual funding rates in XRP and XMR are nearing 50%, a sign of potential overcrowding in the bullish long positions. On Deribit, ether risk reversals show a bias for calls across all tenors, with traders buying bull call spreads in large sizes. There is positive dealer gamma build up at the $4,000 strike in ETH, which means that as prices near that level, dealers may trade against the market, arresting price volatility.

ADA Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. After a slow start to the year, Cardano (ADA) Price is gaining momentum in Q2 2025. The recent Plomin Hard Fork unlocked full decentralized governance, strengthening investor confidence. Now, with rising institutional interest, ETF speculation, and a recovering crypto market, Cardano price prediction 2025 is once again a hot topic. Can ADA Price surge past $2 this year? Let‚Äôs explore key technicals, expert forecasts, and long-term projections up to 2050. Coinpedia‚Äôs Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach a potential high of $2.05 in 2025 , driven by hopes of ETF approval, full decentralization after the Plomin Hard Fork, and increasing institutional interest. However, if ADA fails to hold above key support, it may range between $0.85 and $1.25 . Table of Contents Coinpedia‚Äôs Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 ‚Äì 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $¬†0.90676604 6.24% Market Cap $¬†32,098,150,477.4986 Trading Volume $¬†2,189,562,353.2176 Circulating Supply 35,398,491,999.0914 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 Cardano remained stuck in a prolonged downtrend throughout H1 2025 but began recovering in late June following the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US conflict. Over the past 22 days, ADA has surged nearly 47% from its $0.55 support level. By mid-July, ADA broke out of its falling wedge pattern, supported by renewed bullish momentum across the crypto market. Optimism around a potential ADA ETF, growing institutional interest, and Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high of $123,231 have further fueled the rally. ADA has now pierced the 200-day EMA and flipped it into support, signaling sustained bullish momentum and the potential for further gains. The key level to watch next is $0.83. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $1.10, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.32 by July end. Moreover, in the past 15-day span, Spot volume has peaked, active addresses (7d) have increased to 158.65K, and whale transactions are also pacing up. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.70 could send ADA back to $0.65, and $0.55 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp‚Äôs rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet‚Äôs circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10‚Äì$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows.
