2025-07-21T14:55:35,"Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout: New All-Time High or Just a Fakeout?","Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $119,600 on Monday morning, up around $3,000 already on the day. However, volume is failing to come in to confirm that this breakout is legitimate. That said, there is still time. Could this breakout take out the previous all-time high and go to $130,000 and above? Where is Bitcoin going next? Where Bitcoin is going next, no person knows. It might well be speculated that given the disastrous state of nation budgets, and the huge likelihood of more central bank printing of fiat currencies, that assets such as Bitcoin will probably keep rising. However, there are no certainties, and the next black swan might be just around the corner. Kiyosaki warns of a Bitcoin “bust” Robert Kiyosaki, renowned author and entrepreneur, is warning of a Bitcoin “bust” that may be about to happen. He does say though, that if this does take place, he will be buying. While Kiyosaki certainly knows real estate, he is not an authority on Bitcoin, besides knowing that long term, it is a great buy. Will the UK sell its Bitcoin? A nation state may be about to sell its Bitcoin. If the Sunday Telegraph is to be believed, the UK Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is thinking of selling around $5 billion worth of $BTC in order to help shore up a nasty shortfall in public finances. It seems the UK will never learn. All of the trumpeting made by former Chancellor, and eventual Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, where he promised to make the UK a global hub for crypto, turned into an anti-crypto regime that not only made regulatory compliance extremely difficult for crypto businesses wishing to set up shop there, but also made life hell for UK citizens who wanted to purchase crypto. The UK does have a past history of incompetence relating to its asset holdings. Gordon Brown, UK Chancellor at the turn of the century, decided that it would be a good move to sell a large chunk of the UK’s gold. He announced the idea to the market, and said when he would sell. The market brought the price down as low as possible, bought all the gold, and then watched with satisfaction as gold increased around 700% over the next 10 years. $BTC breakout or fakeout? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for the $BTC price shows the breakout of the triangle. It can also be seen how the price has come back to either test the top of the triangle, and the $119,000 support/resistance, or it is about to fall back inside the triangle, signalling a fakeout. Very low breakout volume could support the latter outcome. Nevertheless, if $BTC is breaking out, what the price has done up to now is perfectly reasonable and to be expected. Bulls will be looking to take charge from now on in. As far as market manipulation goes, the sweep underneath the triangle and the support levels on Sunday would likely have taken out the stops of those going long. Perhaps a dip back into the triangle could also take out those stops yet again? No volume support for breakout Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the large amount of volatility around the current levels. However, the volume profile reveals the smallest of green bars so far. Certainly not a good signal to reinforce a breakout. The RSI at the bottom of the chart illustrates that the indicator line is angled back towards the top. That said, it will need to get above the previous high of 78.29 in order to nullify the bearish divergence that is still a threat in the background. Is a Bitcoin fall coming? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC , seen through the eyes of a bear rather than a bull, could be suggesting that Robert Kiyosaki’s “bust” might indeed come to pass. The $119,000 resistance is proving a tough nut for the bulls to crack. In addition, the RSI reveals that the indicator line might just face a third rejection at the trendline if the current breakout does fail to materialise. The bearish divergence on this time frame is far more concerning than on the daily time frame, as price moves up while the RSI continues to trend down. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicators very near the top. Are they about to pivot and turn back down again? All of these factors are a worry for Bitcoin bulls. Nevertheless, if one zooms further out into the 2-week and the monthly charts, the bullishness does return. Therefore, could there be a short-term pullback, followed by a continuation of the bull run? This remains to be seen, and time will tell.

2025-07-21T14:55:16,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Continues To Consolidate, Falls Short Of $120,000 Yet Again","Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a positive note after a sluggish weekend that saw sellers push the price down to a low of $116,208 before it closed Sunday at $117,240. However, it fell short of $120,000, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $119,618 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,295. Michael Saylor Teases Another Bitcoin (BTC) Buy Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor teased an imminent Bitcoin purchase as the value of the BTC treasury company’s holdings crossed $71 billion. Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase was on July 14, when it purchased 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million. The acquisition took the company’s total holdings to 601,550 BTC , valued at $71.4 billion at current prices. Strategy is up over 66% on its Bitcoin investment, and is sitting on $28.5 billion worth of unrealized gains. Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy are one of the biggest drivers of BTC’s current rally, alongside spot Bitcoin ETFs, crypto exchanges, and institutional investors. The company’s stock is up over 21%, surging as the crypto market rallies, with BTC hitting record levels. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $363 million on Friday, extending their inflow streak to 12 days amid burgeoning investor interest. As expected, BlackRock’s IBIT led the inflows, adding $496 million, cementing its position as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $86 billion in assets. However, Fidelity’s FBTC registered a marginal outflow of $17.94 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of over $81 million. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted around $6.6 billion in net inflows over the 12 days. July 10 registered the largest single-day inflow, worth $1.03 billion. This was also the first time Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in inflows on two consecutive days. Other notable inflows include $799 million on July 16 and $601 million on July 3. Charles Schwab To Offer Bitcoin, Ether Spot Trading Charles Schwab is planning to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The plan was announced by CEO Rick Wurster, who said that Schwab’s clients already have substantial exposure to crypto through exchange-traded products (ETPs). However, Wurster noted that crypto makes up a very small portion of its clients’ total wealth, $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion. “We anticipate launching Bitcoin and Ether sometime soon so that our clients have access to that. We think that will be an acceleration of our growth.” Wurster stated that most clients keep 98% of their wealth with Schwab, but hold only 1-2% of their crypto assets with digital-native firms. “They really want to bring it back to Schwab because they trust us. They want us to sit alongside their other assets.” The introduction of spot crypto trading will see Charles Schwab compete with crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Wurster confirmed Schwab’s intention to compete with Coinbase, stating, “If they’re buying their crypto at Coinbase, we would love to see them bring their crypto back to Schwab.” The firm has increased its involvement in crypto in recent months amid growing regulatory clarity. In 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve withdrew restrictive guidelines issued following the FTX collapse, allowing banks to participate in crypto and offer custody and trading services. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded after starting the week on a sluggish note. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded in a range since setting a new all-time high on Monday. BTC raced past $123,000 on Monday, reaching a new all-time high of $123,091 before settling at $119,714. It has struggled to regain $120,000 since, trading between $116,000 and $120,000 as buyers refused to cede ground to sellers, indicating that bullish sentiment remains intact. Price action remained muted over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal decline on Saturday and 0.48% on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency entered into a consolidation phase after Monday’s rally to a new all-time high, trading in a narrow range between $117,000 and $120,000. BTC maintained its position above $117,000-$118,000, indicating that bulls have not ceded ground to sellers. However, analysts believe BTC is gearing up for a big move, which could see it test the $123,000 level and return to price discovery. Trader Marcus Corvinus stated, “ BTC is getting ready for a big move. Bitcoin is moving inside a triangle pattern and staying above strong support around $116,000 to $117,000. Right now, it's going sideways but not for long.” A breakout above $123,000 could take BTC past $125,000. However, if it slips below $117,000-$118,000, then markets can expect a drop to $110,000 or lower. “If it breaks below support, the price may fall to $111,000 or lower.” BTC registered a sharp increase on Thursday (July 10), rising 3.51% to $115,160. It continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced past $120,000 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified, crossing $123,000 and setting a new all-time high of $123,091. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately registering a 0.92% increase. The price lost momentum on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, it fell nearly 2% to $117,682, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $115,701. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Price action turned bearish on Friday as BTC dropped 1.03% and settled at $117,877. Sellers retained control over the weekend as the price registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. The current session sees BTC up 1.51%, having reclaimed $119,000 and trading around $119,042. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-21T14:47:34,"Commodity strategist reveals what’s really powering the crypto rally","Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence , shared some new thoughts on the future of crypto . Namely, in a July 21 post on X, McGlone stated that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies may be fine, provided the stock market keeps going up. “Bitcoin, cryptos may be fine, as long as the stock market keeps going up.” – Mike McGlone The strategist’s post was a reply to Scott Melker, the host of The Wolf Of All Streets podcast, whose most recent episode , featuring McGlone as a guest, tackles topics including Bitcoin’s recent bullish trend and stablecoin legalization. Bitcoin, cryptos may be fine, as long as the stock market keeps going up https://t.co/2eYnlaGJ8D — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) July 21, 2025 Why does the stock market matter for crypto? During the podcast discussion, McGlone expressed clearly the opinion that cryptocurrencies are intrinsically tied to the stock market , stating: “I can’t even have a view on cryptos … anymore without having a view of the stock market first. It’s got to go up first.” – Mike McGlone Another topic under discussion was the competitive nature of the market and the lack of retail euphoria in Bitcoin, given the difficulty new market entrants face when trying to explore crypto. Accordingly, McGlone argued that investors ought to approach Bitcoin as more akin to some kind of leverage stock that moves with the stock market, with an important note that past performance should not be taken as an indicator of future gains. Co-guest James Lavish of Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, however, challenged this view with a remark that Bitcoin has only had a few cycles, which is not enough to make any sort of objective analysis of the correlation between past and future success. “There will be cycles. There will be expansions and contractions of liquidity and credit, and I do believe that Bitcoin will follow that. And why is that? Because it is literally the opposite of fiat, and so if you want to protect your money, you buy gold or Bitcoin.” – James Lavish Lavish further added that institutional demand complicates the picture, especially given Bitcoin’s role in liquidity expansion.

2025-07-21T14:35:24,"Unleashed: Stock Market Records Soar – What This Means for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld Unleashed: Stock Market Records Soar – What This Means for Crypto Investors Even if your primary focus is the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the broader financial landscape is crucial. Recently, traditional markets have been making headlines, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new intraday stock market records . This significant development, as reported by financial commentator Walter Bloomberg on X, raises important questions for every investor: what do these impressive milestones mean for the broader economy, and more specifically, for your digital asset portfolio? Unpacking These Impressive Stock Market Records The financial world buzzed with excitement as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices achieved new intraday record highs. For context: S&P 500: Represents 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, a key gauge of the American economy’s health. New stock market records here signal robust corporate earnings and broad investor confidence. Nasdaq Composite: Heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies, it indicates the tech sector’s performance. New highs reflect strong innovation and a bullish outlook on technological advancements. An “intraday record high” signifies that the index surpassed its previous highest point during the trading day, capturing peak investor optimism and market momentum across major economic sectors. Why Are These Stock Market Records Being Set Now? Several factors are propelling this surge in traditional markets, pushing indices to new stock market records : Strong Corporate Earnings: Many major companies, especially in tech, have reported robust earnings, exceeding expectations. AI and Technology Optimism: Excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) fuels massive investments and valuations in tech companies, significantly benefiting the Nasdaq. Anticipation of Interest Rate Cuts: Growing anticipation of future rate cuts makes borrowing cheaper, stimulates economic activity, and can make stocks more attractive. Resilient Economy & Lower Inflation: The U.S. economy shows resilience with strong employment, and signs of cooling inflation reduce the likelihood of aggressive monetary tightening, generally positive for asset prices. These elements combine to create a powerful updraft, reflecting a collective belief among investors that the economic outlook is bright. How Do Stock Market Records Influence the Crypto Landscape? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the performance of traditional markets might seem distant, but their ripple effects are certainly felt in crypto. The relationship often swings between correlation and decoupling. Here’s how traditional market strength can influence digital assets: Investor Sentiment & Risk Appetite: Booming traditional markets often increase risk appetite. Cryptocurrencies, viewed as “risk-on” assets, can benefit as investors seek higher returns. Capital Flows & Institutional Adoption: Gains in the stock market can free up capital, some of which might flow into crypto for diversification. This confidence can also encourage traditional institutions to explore and invest in crypto. Macroeconomic Linkages: Factors driving stock market records—like inflation trends and interest rate expectations—also influence crypto. Strong economic growth can support broader investment in innovative technologies, including blockchain. While crypto markets have shown instances of decoupling, a general positive correlation has been observed, particularly with tech stocks. This suggests that the rising tide in traditional markets often lifts the crypto boat. Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Amidst Strong Stock Market Records The current environment of soaring stock market records presents both unique challenges and compelling opportunities for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Challenges: Competition for Capital: Attractive returns in traditional equities can divert capital from crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Stronger financial markets might lead to increased focus on crypto regulation, introducing compliance burdens. Opportunities: Broader Economic Confidence: A robust traditional economy often leads to higher disposable income for speculative investments like crypto. Technological Innovation Spillover: The strength of the tech sector directly links to advancements in blockchain and crypto, fostering cross-pollination and benefiting emerging crypto projects. Increased Institutional Interest: Success in traditional markets provides stability and capital for institutions to explore and integrate digital assets. The interplay is complex. While traditional markets may occasionally draw attention, their underlying strength often creates a more fertile ground for the growth and adoption of innovative technologies, including those powering the crypto world. Navigating the Waters: Your Strategy in Light of New Stock Market Records As traditional markets achieve new stock market records , here are actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Understand macroeconomics and traditional market trends for holistic financial insights. Evaluate Risk Tolerance: Reassess your personal risk tolerance. Crypto remains volatile; align allocations with comfort levels. Diversify: Spread investments across asset classes, including traditional and various cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risk. Long-Term Vision: Focus on crypto project fundamentals. A strong long-term thesis helps ride out volatility. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly to average out your purchase price over time. By integrating insights from traditional markets into your crypto strategy, you can make more resilient and potentially more profitable decisions. Conclusion: The Intertwined Future of Finance The recent surge in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new intraday stock market records signals robust economic confidence and technological advancement. While the cryptocurrency market often operates distinctly, it is undeniably influenced by these broader macroeconomic currents. The “risk-on” sentiment from strong equity markets can foster a favorable environment for digital assets, encouraging capital flow and institutional engagement. Yet, challenges like capital competition and increased regulatory attention also emerge. For crypto investors, these developments highlight the importance of a holistic financial understanding. The days of viewing crypto as entirely separate are largely behind us. We are moving towards an increasingly intertwined future where market performances echo across sectors. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate this evolving environment and capitalize on opportunities from both traditional market triumphs and ongoing innovation within the decentralized world. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Are crypto and traditional markets always correlated? A1: No, correlation is dynamic. While often linked to tech stocks, crypto can decouple due to internal factors or specific blockchain advancements. Q2: What is “risk-on” sentiment and how does it affect crypto? A2: “Risk-on” means investors are confident and seek higher returns. Riskier assets like crypto tend to perform well. “Risk-off” sees a move to safer assets. Q3: Should I adjust my crypto portfolio based on stock market performance? A3: Reactive changes are often not advisable. Focus on long-term crypto fundamentals and maintain diversification, considering broader economic trends. Q4: Could strong stock markets pull capital away from crypto? A4: Potentially, yes, as attractive traditional returns might divert some capital. However, overall economic strength can also increase capital available for all assets. Q5: What role does inflation play in both markets? A5: Inflation impacts both. High inflation can drive demand for hedges like Bitcoin. Central bank responses affect stock valuations. In crypto, it can sometimes boost demand for decentralized alternatives. Enjoyed this deep dive into how traditional market records can impact your crypto journey?

2025-07-21T14:33:50,"AI 챗봇 그록이 예측한 도지코인 급등 시나리오","도지코인이 최근 새로운 국면을 맞이했다. 수개월간의 횡보 이후, 도지코인($DOGE)은 엘리엇 파동 이론에서 전형적인 반전 신호로 여겨지는 5파동 하락 확장 쐐기형 패턴을 돌파한 것으로 나타났다. 스토캐스틱 RSI 가 오랜만에 녹색 신호를 보이는 가운데, 도지코인이 일주일 만에 33% 급등 했다. 일일 거래량이 60억 달러를 넘어서면서 개인 투자자들과 투기 세력들의 관심이 다시 집중되고 있는 것으로 나타났다. 그록과 다수의 시장 분석가들의 견해에 따르면, 이번 상승세는 2024년 3분기의 대규모 상승장을 이끌었던 구조와 유사한 패턴을 보이고 있다. 과거 패턴이 반복된다면, 새로운 밈코인 슈퍼사이클의 시작점에 도달했을 가능성이 있는 것으로 분석된다. 투자자들이 이더리움 기반의 포스트 아이러니 토큰인 토큰6900($T6900) 과 같은 더욱 광기어린 밈 코인으로 자금을 이동하고 있는 것으로 보인다. 이는 도지코인($DOGE)을 회사채처럼 안정적으로 보이게 만드는 수준의 극단적 투기 양상을 보이고 있다. 도지코인에 무슨 일이 벌어졌나 도지코인이 2주 차트에서 하락세 확장 쐐기 패턴의 5단계 를 완성한 것으로 나타났다. 이는 전형적으로 하락세의 종료와 새로운 상승 동력의 시작을 알리는 신호로 해석된다. 도지코인의 현재 상황이 2024년 3분기 급등 직전과 매우 유사한 양상을 보이고 있다. 당시 가격 급등을 이끌었던 패턴이 현재 동일하게 나타나는 중이며, 모멘텀이 점차 회복세를 보이는 것으로 관찰된다. 스토캐스틱 RSI가 과매도 구간을 벗어나며 상승 반전에 성공했는데, 이는 일반적으로 추세 전환의 초기 신호로 해석된다. 현재 지표는 강한 매수 신호를 나타내고 있는 것으로 분석된다. 그록의 따르면 현재 상승세가 지속될 경우, 분석가들은 단기 목표가를 0.36달러에서 0.42달러 선으로 전망했다. 이 수준을 돌파할 경우 다음 단계로의 도약이 가능할 것으로 보이며, 중기 목표가는 0.48달러까지 확장될 수 있다. 시장이 매우 낙관적인 상황에서는 1달러까지도 도달할 수 있을 것으로 예측된다. 도지코인의 거래 데이터가 이를 뒷받침하고 있다. 24시간 거래량이 60억 달러를 돌파했으며, 주간 가격은 34.41% 상승했다. 이 정도의 유동성은 밈 트레이더들이 동면에서 깨어날 때만 나타나는 현상으로 보인다. 도지코인 가격 상승에는 일론 머스크 효과도 한몫을 하고 있다. X(구 트위터)에서 도지코인 결제 시스템 도입에 대한 소문이 계속해서 돌고 있는 상황이다. 이러한 소문과 함께 최근의 상승세가 맞물리면서 개인 투자자들 사이에서 투자 심리가 과열되는 양상을 보이고 있다. 밈코인 시장 심리 변화 조짐 보여 도지코인이 밈 코인 생태계 전체를 움직이고 있다. 지난 사이클에서는 $PEPE, $BONK를 비롯한 다수의 밈 코인들이 도지코인의 영향으로 급등했으며, 이는 동일한 유동성과 시장 혼란의 흐름을 타고 있는 것으로 분석된다. 시장의 기초 여건과는 무관한 상황이다. 트레이더들이 더욱 강력한 상승세를 보이는 차트를 좇으면서 시장의 분위기가 가속화되고 있다. 이번에는 실체 없는 과대 광고를 넘어서 우량 밈코인들이 더 빠른 속도로 성장하는 양상을 보이고 있다. 시장의 투자자들은 실용성을 추구하는 것이 아닌, 기이함으로 포장된 솔직함을 추구하고 있다. 더 이상 누구도 가식적인 모습을 보이지 않는다. 투자자들은 도지코인과 같은 성공 사례를 기대하되, 환상은 덜한 투자처를 찾고 있는 것으로 보인다. 토큰 6900 ($T6900), 도지코인 관련 우려가 제기된 암호화폐로 지목돼 도지코인은 시장 차트를 따라가는 반면, T6900은 어떤 것도 따르지 않는다. T6900은 현존하는 유일한 솔직한 자산으로 평가받고 있다. 실용성도 없고, 로드맵도 없으며, 오직 밈으로 가득한 망상에만 100% 전념하는 특징을 보이고 있다. 이더리움 기반으로 개발된 토큰6900($T6900) 은 실용성이 전혀 없음을 공공연히 드러내는 밈코인이다. SPX6900과 유사하나 더욱 아이러니하고 부조리한 성격을 띄며, 공급량이 1개 더 많다는 점에서 객관적으로 우위를 점하고 있다는 평가를 받고 있다. 해당 프로젝트는 현재 토큰당 0.00665달러의 가격으로 프리세일을 진행해 이미 90만 2천 달러 이상의 자금을 모집한 상태다. 밈 트레이더들의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략으로 67%의 스테이킹 보상을 제시하고 있는 것으로 보인다. 토큰6900은 밈과 시장, 그리고 정신적 붕괴가 교차하는 지점에 존재한다. 인공지능의 약속이나 로드맵 지연, 또는 수개월째 움직임이 없는 디파이 자산에 대해 전혀 신경 쓰지 않는다. 현재 시장 상황은 활용 사례와는 무관한 것으로 보인다. 이는 오히려 유동성에 대한 집단적 망상에 가깝다. 현 시점에서 시장을 이해하려는 시도 자체를 포기하는 것이 유일하게 남은 합리적 선택으로 여겨진다. 토큰6900 구매 방법 에 대한 전체 가이드를 소개한다. 다음은 암호화폐 전문가 및 유튜버 재테크의 기술이 소개한 토큰6900 밈코인 프로젝트이다. 밈 열풍이 거세지는 가운데 투자자들의 선택 주목 도지코인의 상승세가 지속될 경우, 이러한 영향이 더 작고 변동성이 큰 밈코인들로 확산될 것으로 전망된다. 이는 통상적인 시장 패턴으로, 현재 이미 그 조짐이 나타나고 있는 상황이다. 도지코인이 0.42달러까지 상승할 것으로 전망된다. T6900 가격 예측은 현실성이 떨어질 수 있으나, 이것이 바로 암호화폐 시장의 본질적 특성으로 보인다. 알파 수익은 단순히 기본적 분석에만 국한되지 않는다. 시장 분위기를 읽는 것이 관건이며, 현재 시장은 한 가지 질문을 던지고 있는 상황이다. 오늘날 구매 가능한 가장 기이한 물건들에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있다. 소비자들 사이에서 독특하고 비일상적인 제품을 찾는 경향이 두드러지는 가운데, 시장에서는 예상을 뛰어넘는 다양한 특이 상품들이 등장하고 있는 것으로 보인다. 본 기사는 추측성 분석과 프리세일 프로젝트 관련 내용을 포함하고 있다. 투자 전 반드시 개별적인 조사와 검토가 필요하며, 감당할 수 있는 범위 내에서만 투자를 진행하는 것이 바람직하다.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/grok-predicts-dogecoin-price-as-token6900-prepares-for-rally-kr/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI","Altcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-21T14:32:54,"Russia to impose fines for crypto payments next year","Starting from next year, authorities in Russia are going to impose fines for cryptocurrency payments that have been banned since 2021. According to a new law, the use of digital coins as a means of payment in the country will also be punished with confiscation of the assets involved. Russians will be fined for paying with cryptocurrencies Payments with decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin will result in substantial fines for Russian citizens and businesses from 2026 onwards, the local press reported, quoting a prominent member of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. The government’s plan was revealed to Izvestia by Anatoly Aksakov, head of the chamber’s Committee on Financial Markets. He told the Daily that deputies will consider a bill introducing the penalties this fall in order to define liability in a currently gray area. According to the legislation, drafted jointly by the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, private individuals who pay with crypto will face fines in the range of 100-200,000 rubles (over $2,500), and companies will be fined between 700,000 and 1 million rubles (almost $13,000). Additionally, it provides for the seizure by the state of the illegally used coins, the newspaper noted. In April, the executive power in Moscow approved amendments legalizing the confiscation of cryptocurrency by recognizing it as property in criminal proceedings. Since Jan. 1, this year, crypto assets have been recognized as property also in the Tax Code in order to regulate the taxation of related activities such as mining, which was legalized in 2024, and trading, which is allowed under limited circumstances. While the exact amounts of the monetary penalties were announced by the Director of the Legal Department at the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ), Andrey Medvedev, during the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum in May, it was unclear when they would be enforced. Russia faces numerous use cases for crypto in payments Russia’s monetary authority has been a strong opponent to legalizing domestic crypto payments, maintaining that the ruble, including its digital form, should remain the only legal tender. At the same time, it also agreed to oversee an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) facilitating crypto exchange and settlements in foreign trade to help Russian firms bypass Western sanctions. Using cryptos to pay for goods and services has been banned in Russia since the enforcement of the law “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFAs) in 2021. Despite that, Russians have been spending digital coins, and such transactions scored a 2.5 increase in the first year of the war in Ukraine, which started in 2022. The use cases include not only transfers of funds abroad, in circumvention of financial restrictions, but also remunerating employees, like developers who moved to other countries. Last week, Izvestia quoted labor authorities warning that paying salaries in crypto will also result in hefty fines for companies. Cryptocurrency payment is often associated with unofficial employment, Alexey Gorelkin, a specialist in the field of information security, told the publication. He elaborated: “This is a common option for Russian citizens who do remote work in our country for companies outside of Russia. At the same time, Russian companies rarely work directly with crypto, preferring to use it as additional motivation, as property incentive rather than wages.” Video games have provided another opportunity to employ digital currencies in payments, with Web3 platforms often opting to transact in a cryptocurrency generated within their gaming projects, according to Ivan Kalmykov, an IT expert quoted by the daily. Various services and Telegram bots processing crypto payments, including through QR codes , have been quite popular in Russia as well. An estimate suggests that up to 400 of these continued to operate two years after the enforcement of the coin payment ban.

2025-07-21T14:30:23,"Public Companies Bitcoin: A Staggering $953M Surge in Corporate Holdings Signals Growing Confidence","BitcoinWorld Public Companies Bitcoin: A Staggering $953M Surge in Corporate Holdings Signals Growing Confidence The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with a remarkable trend: major public companies are significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings. This past week alone, the corporate sector poured nearly a billion dollars into Bitcoin, signaling a robust and growing confidence in the digital asset’s long-term value. This surge in public companies Bitcoin investment is a powerful testament to its evolving role in traditional finance. Why Are Public Companies Bitcoin Investments Surging? Last week marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, as public companies, excluding miners, collectively acquired an astounding $953 million worth of the digital currency. This substantial influx of capital, as reported by SoSoValue data for the week ending July 21, underscores a deepening institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a strategic move by corporations looking to diversify their treasuries and hedge against economic uncertainties. The sheer volume of this investment highlights a shift in perception, moving Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a recognized store of value. The leader of this recent buying spree was Strategy, a name synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. They added a colossal $739.8 million to their reserves, acquiring 6,220 BTC at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This singular purchase alone accounts for a significant portion of the total corporate acquisition last week, further solidifying Strategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Their continued accumulation sends a strong message to the market, often influencing other companies to consider similar strategies. This trend of public companies Bitcoin accumulation suggests a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Companies are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, a secure digital reserve, and a strategic asset for future growth. The transparency of these public disclosures also adds a layer of credibility to the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting even more mainstream investors. Who Are the Key Players Driving Public Companies Bitcoin Adoption? While Strategy remains the titan in the realm of public companies Bitcoin holdings, the past week saw several new and notable entrants joining the ranks of corporate Bitcoin investors. This diversification of corporate interest indicates that the trend is broadening beyond just a few pioneering firms. Here’s a closer look at the key players in last week’s significant acquisitions: Strategy: As mentioned, Strategy led the charge with an impressive $739.8 million purchase of 6,220 BTC. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 607,770 BTC. Their consistent buying strategy has made them a benchmark for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Sequans: A new and significant player from France, Sequans made a substantial entry into the Bitcoin market, acquiring $150 million worth of Bitcoin, equivalent to 1,264 BTC. This marks a notable European corporate embrace of the digital asset. The Smarter Web: This entity added $36.1 million to their treasury in Bitcoin, securing 325 BTC. Their investment highlights the growing interest from various sectors in integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Semler Scientific: With a $25 million purchase, Semler Scientific acquired 210 BTC. This move by a healthcare company further exemplifies the diverse range of industries now considering Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Blockchain Group: As their name suggests, Blockchain Group, a company deeply rooted in the digital asset space, also made a strategic acquisition of $2.56 million for 22 BTC, reinforcing their commitment to the ecosystem. It’s also worth noting the movements of existing players. Japan’s Metaplanet, after five consecutive weeks of Bitcoin purchases, paused their accumulation last week. While they didn’t add to their holdings, their previous consistent buying demonstrates the sustained interest from international firms in Bitcoin. The collective efforts of these firms have propelled the total Bitcoin holdings by public companies (excluding miners) to 681,680 BTC. At current valuations, this massive stash is worth approximately $80.4 billion, representing about 3.43% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. This percentage, though seemingly small, signifies a substantial and growing portion of Bitcoin being held by long-term, strategic corporate entities, effectively reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges and potentially impacting future price dynamics. What Does This Mean for the Future of Public Companies Bitcoin Holdings? The recent surge in public companies Bitcoin acquisitions has profound implications for the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial landscape. This isn’t just about companies holding a digital asset; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporate treasuries are managed and how value is perceived in an increasingly digital world. Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Enhanced Legitimacy: When established public companies invest in Bitcoin, it lends immense credibility to the asset. This can encourage other corporations, institutional investors, and even sovereign wealth funds to explore similar strategies, further mainstreaming Bitcoin. Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns, many companies view Bitcoin as a robust hedge against currency devaluation. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Diversification: Companies are looking beyond traditional assets to diversify their balance sheets. Bitcoin offers a unique uncorrelated asset that can potentially enhance portfolio returns and reduce overall risk. Strategic Positioning: Holding Bitcoin can be a strategic move for companies looking to position themselves at the forefront of digital innovation and the future of finance. It signals forward-thinking leadership and an embrace of emerging technologies. Challenges and Considerations: While the trend is largely positive, there are inherent challenges and considerations for public companies holding Bitcoin: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. While corporate holders often have a long-term outlook, significant price swings can impact quarterly earnings reports and investor perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, custody, or usage could impact corporate Bitcoin strategies. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or theft. Companies must invest heavily in secure cold storage solutions and robust cybersecurity protocols. Accounting Treatment: The accounting treatment of Bitcoin can be complex for corporations, often requiring them to mark down holdings during price drops, even if they don’t intend to sell. Actionable Insights for the Market: This sustained corporate interest in Bitcoin suggests a maturation of the asset class. For individual investors, this trend could signal a long-term bullish outlook, as more of Bitcoin’s circulating supply moves into strong hands with less likelihood of immediate sale. It also highlights the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial strategies, paving the way for further innovation and adoption across various industries. The continued accumulation by public companies Bitcoin holdings could also lead to reduced market liquidity, potentially contributing to price stability in the long run. Summary: The recent acquisition of nearly a billion dollars in Bitcoin by public companies, spearheaded by Strategy and joined by new entrants like Sequans, marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. This trend underscores Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a strategic treasury asset, a hedge against inflation, and a crucial component of future-oriented corporate balance sheets. While challenges remain, the undeniable momentum behind public companies Bitcoin investment signals a transformative shift in global finance, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a foundational digital asset for the modern economy.

2025-07-21T14:30:20,"Bitcoin Whale Metrics Flash Mixed Signals: Monthly Inflows Rise And Daily Outflows Start Slowing","Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range, consolidating above the $115,000 level and just below the key psychological barrier at $120,000. While the price structure remains bullish, market analysts are increasingly divided. Some expect Bitcoin to break higher toward uncharted territory, while others warn of an incoming correction, citing historical patterns and profit-taking behaviors. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record $50 Billion – Volatility Incoming? Adding weight to the cautionary outlook, new data from CryptoQuant reveals a significant spike in whale activity. The Whale to Exchange Flow monthly average has surged by nearly $17 billion in just four days. This kind of jump historically coincides with either profit realization or increased volatility, as large holders adjust their positions. Although bulls are still in control of the trend, this level of whale inflow to exchanges may introduce short-term selling pressure, especially as Bitcoin hovers near its all-time high. The coming days could prove pivotal, as market participants assess whether this activity marks the beginning of a larger distribution phase or simply a healthy rotation within a bullish uptrend. Whale Inflows Surge, But Daily Trend Suggests Potential Easing Top analyst Darkfost has drawn attention to a critical development in Bitcoin’s market structure. According to his analysis, during the last two major market tops, exchange inflows from large holders surpassed $75 billion—an event that marked the beginning of a sharp correction or an extended consolidation phase. These inflows are a key signal, often indicating that whales are beginning to distribute their holdings after a strong rally. Currently, the data suggests a similar pattern could be unfolding. Between July 14 and July 18, the Whale to Exchange Flow monthly average surged from $28 billion to $45 billion, marking a $17 billion increase in just four days. While the recent 80,000 BTC transfer—linked to the Satoshi-era whale—likely played a role in this jump, it also reflects a broader trend: whales may be capitalizing on the recent all-time high to lock in profits. However, there’s an important nuance. Darkfost notes that while the monthly average has spiked, daily inflow data shows a noticeable decline. This suggests that the selling pressure from whales may be subsiding—at least temporarily. If the trend continues, it could provide the market with room to stabilize and potentially prepare for another leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details Bitcoin Consolidates Below Resistance Amid Bullish Structure Bitcoin continues to trade within a narrow consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077, as shown on the 4-hour chart. Despite recent pauses in upward momentum, the broader structure remains bullish. The alignment of the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) confirms a healthy uptrend, with all three moving averages sloping upward and supporting the price action from below. The $122K level has proven to be a formidable resistance, rejecting multiple attempts to break higher. Meanwhile, the $115,724 support has remained intact, forming a clear short-term range. Volume has decreased over the last few sessions, which suggests indecision or a lack of conviction from bulls and bears alike. This kind of consolidation often precedes a breakout, especially when aligned with strong trend structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Sees Heavy Accumulation – Whales Add 8M LINK In One Month A decisive move above $122,077 with strong volume would likely confirm the next bullish leg, possibly targeting the $130K zone. Conversely, if bears gain ground and break below the $115,724 support, BTC could test the 100 SMA near $114,800 or even revisit deeper support zones. Until then, traders should closely monitor the volume profile and structure around these levels to anticipate the next breakout or breakdown.

2025-07-21T14:30:18,"China Dumps US Treasuries for Third Straight Month While Stockpiling $247,876,656,239 in Gold: Report","China has lowered its US Treasury holdings for the third month in a row, opting to hoard large amounts of gold bullion instead. According to the latest data from the US Treasury, China lowered its T-Bill holdings by $900 million, from $757.2 billion in April to $756.3 billion in the month of May. The sell-off marks China’s third straight shedding of Treasuries since February, when the Asian powerhouse held $784.3 billion worth of US bonds. Meanwhile, reports that China is covertly buying much more gold than what public numbers disclose are making the rounds. Stefan Gleason, president and chief executive at Money Metals, tells MarketWatch that China is likely downplaying its gold purchases for efficiency’s sake. “Given how much gold it’s buying, it’s quite sensible for China to limit public disclosures where possible… After all, it’s not in the interest of any bona-fide buyer to take actions that make its purchases more expensive than they need to be.” Joseph Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council, says that there is debate over “whether the PBOC’s (People’s Bank of China) reported purchases fully capture its activity.” The analyst also admitted that there is “always the case that maybe more is going on than is reported.” And Jan Nieuwenhuijs, an analyst at Money Metals, says that China’s gold holdings are likely more than double what is officially reported. Nieuwenhuijs says that “in reality,” the PBOC held 5,065 metric tons of gold in its reserve at the end of 2024, which pales in comparison to its reported holdings of 2,280 metric tons. “China [is] importing much more gold than what is sold in the private market through the Shanghai Gold Exchange, and what industry insiders have shared with me over the years.” The latest data from the World Gold Council shows that China holds 2,296 tonnes of gold worth more than $247 billion.

This is one such tale, focusing on an early Bitcoin investor whose strategic moves have led to an astonishing profit. Imagine turning a modest investment into hundreds of millions of dollars. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the real-life achievement of a savvy individual who bought into Bitcoin over a decade ago and is now reaping the rewards of their foresight. Who is This Mystery Bitcoin Investor and What’s Their Story? Details about the identity of this particular Bitcoin investor remain shrouded in mystery, as is common in the decentralized world of crypto. However, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter) has shed light on their incredible journey. Approximately 12 years ago, this individual made a prescient move, investing a mere $1.66 million to acquire a substantial 5,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin’s price was a fraction of what it is today, making this a bold, pioneering decision. Fast forward to the present, and this early Bitcoin investor has begun to realize some of their immense gains. Over the past eight months, they have systematically sold portions of their holdings. The latest transaction saw them offload an additional 250 BTC, valued at approximately $29.68 million at the time of sale. This recent sale brings their total realized sales to a staggering 1,000 BTC, cumulatively valued at around $106 million. Despite these significant sales, the investor still retains a substantial 4,000 BTC, a testament to their long-term vision and belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Let’s put their journey into perspective with a quick breakdown: Action Details Value Initial Investment Bought 5,000 BTC 12 years ago $1.66 million Recent Sale Sold 250 BTC $29.68 million Total Sales (Past 8 months) Sold 1,000 BTC $106 million Current Holdings Retains 4,000 BTC Varies with market price Total Profit (Realized & Unrealized) 349x return on initial investment $578 million The Astonishing Profit: How Did This Bitcoin Investor Achieve a 349x Return? The numbers speak for themselves: a total profit of $578 million from an initial $1.66 million investment represents an astounding 349x return. This level of profit is almost unheard of in traditional markets and underscores the unique opportunities that early cryptocurrency adoption presented. The primary factor behind this phenomenal gain is simply the passage of time combined with Bitcoin’s exponential price appreciation. When this Bitcoin investor made their initial purchase, Bitcoin was a niche digital asset, largely unknown to the mainstream. Over the past decade, it has evolved from an obscure digital currency to a globally recognized asset class, attracting institutional investors, major corporations, and even nation-states. This journey has been marked by several bull runs and significant corrections, but the overall trend has been undeniably upward. The investor’s strategy was simple yet profoundly effective: buy low and hold for the long term. This approach, often referred to as ‘HODLing’ in the crypto community, requires immense patience and conviction, especially during bear markets when prices can plummet. By holding onto the majority of their assets for over a decade, this Bitcoin investor allowed the power of compounding and market growth to work its magic, transforming a relatively modest sum into a colossal fortune. What Challenges Did This Bitcoin Investor Face Along the Way? While the profit figures are dazzling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant challenges and risks that this Bitcoin investor undoubtedly navigated. Holding an asset as volatile as Bitcoin for 12 years is no small feat. Consider these hurdles: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has experienced numerous dramatic swings, including crashes of 80% or more from its peak. Enduring such downturns without panic-selling requires incredible emotional resilience. Regulatory Uncertainty: Over the years, Bitcoin has faced scrutiny and uncertainty from governments and financial regulators worldwide. The threat of bans or restrictive regulations loomed large at various points. Security Risks: Storing such a large amount of Bitcoin securely for over a decade demands sophisticated cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks, phishing attempts, and other digital threats. Opportunity Cost: During bear markets, there might have been temptations to sell and reinvest in other assets. The decision to stay invested in Bitcoin, despite potential short-term losses, was a long-term play. This investor’s success is not just about luck; it’s also a testament to their unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential and their ability to withstand immense market pressure. Lessons for Aspiring Bitcoin Investors: What Can We Learn? The story of this anonymous Bitcoin investor offers several invaluable lessons for anyone looking to enter or navigate the cryptocurrency market: Long-Term Vision is Key: Short-term fluctuations are common. True wealth creation in volatile assets like Bitcoin often comes from a long-term holding strategy, allowing time for market cycles to play out. Conviction and Research: This investor likely conducted thorough research and developed a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s underlying technology and potential. This conviction helps weather market storms. Risk Management: While the initial investment was substantial, it was likely a calculated risk relative to their overall financial standing. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Patience is a Virtue: The HODLing strategy is not for the faint of heart. It demands patience and the ability to ignore the noise of daily price movements. Early Adoption Advantage: While the ‘early’ phase of Bitcoin is arguably over, the principle of identifying emerging technologies with strong fundamentals still holds. This success story serves as a powerful reminder of the potential rewards for those who are early, patient, and convicted in their investment choices within transformative technologies.

It highlights that significant wealth can be built in the crypto space, though the dynamics have certainly changed. Today’s market is more mature, with increased institutional participation and clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in many regions. For future Bitcoin investor , the landscape offers different opportunities and challenges.

The core principles of long-term thinking and understanding the underlying asset remain paramount.

2025-07-21T14:15:18,"Bitcoin Price Explodes: BTC Rockets Past $119,000 Milestone","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Explodes: BTC Rockets Past $119,000 Milestone The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, surging past the significant $119,000 mark. This remarkable ascent has captivated investors and analysts alike, sparking renewed optimism about the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. If you’ve been following the market, you know that every major move by Bitcoin sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. Today’s surge is no exception, signaling a potentially bullish phase for the market. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Surge According to diligent market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has indeed climbed above $119,000, specifically noted at $119,030.21 on the Binance USDT market. This isn’t just a number; it’s a psychological and technical milestone that often triggers further momentum. Such movements are rarely isolated incidents; they are typically the culmination of various underlying factors converging to create a powerful upward push. To put this into perspective, let’s look at some recent movements that have contributed to the current bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin price : Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: A shift in global economic policies or inflation concerns often drives investors towards scarce assets like Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin network, enhancing its scalability and security, bolsters confidence. Growing Retail Adoption: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, driving demand through easy-to-use platforms. The consistent upward pressure on the Bitcoin price indicates a strong demand outweighing the available supply, a fundamental principle of economics that applies equally to digital assets. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Rally? The current rally in the Bitcoin price isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are likely contributing to this impressive performance. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency landscape. Is Institutional Adoption Pushing the Bitcoin Price Higher? One of the most significant catalysts for Bitcoin’s recent gains is the continued influx of institutional capital. Major investment firms, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as a viable investment. The approval and launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided regulated and accessible avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace adds legitimacy and stability, significantly influencing the Bitcoin price . How Do Global Events Impact the Bitcoin Price? Global economic conditions play a pivotal role. When traditional markets show signs of instability, or when inflation concerns rise, investors often seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Central bank policies, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical tensions can all indirectly affect the flow of capital into Bitcoin, thereby influencing its market value and the overall Bitcoin price . Are Technological Developments Affecting the Bitcoin Price? While Bitcoin’s core protocol remains robust, ongoing developments in the broader crypto space, such as advancements in scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network) and increased interoperability with other blockchains, contribute to a healthier ecosystem. These improvements enhance Bitcoin’s utility and efficiency, making it more attractive for transactions and long-term holding. A more functional and adaptable network naturally bolsters confidence and can positively impact the Bitcoin price . Navigating the Volatility: What Does This Mean for Investors? While a surging Bitcoin price is exciting, it’s essential for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Bitcoin’s history is marked by periods of rapid ascent followed by corrections. Understanding the potential benefits and challenges is key. Benefits of a Rising Bitcoin Price: Capital Appreciation: For existing holders, a rising price means an increase in the value of their portfolio. Increased Market Confidence: Strong performance can attract new investors, further strengthening the market. Validation of the Asset Class: Reaching new highs reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a significant financial asset. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: What goes up can come down. Sharp corrections are always a possibility. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors might jump in without proper research, leading to potential losses if the market reverses. Regulatory Uncertainty: While progress is being made, regulatory landscapes can change, impacting market sentiment. For those considering entering or expanding their positions, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance. Diversification and a long-term perspective often prove beneficial in the crypto space, especially when observing significant movements in the Bitcoin price . Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Journey Through Peaks and Troughs Bitcoin’s journey has been anything but linear. From its humble beginnings to becoming a global financial phenomenon, the Bitcoin price has seen multiple bull runs and bear markets. Understanding this historical context provides valuable perspective on the current surge. Consider the following simplified table illustrating Bitcoin’s resilience: Year Key Event/Trend Impact on Bitcoin Price 2013 First major bull run, Mt. Gox incident Reached ~$1,200, then significant correction 2017 ICO boom, mainstream awareness Surged to nearly $20,000, followed by crypto winter 2020-2021 Institutional adoption, pandemic stimulus Reached all-time highs above $60,000 Present Continued institutional interest, market maturation Current surge past $119,000 Each time, despite significant pullbacks, Bitcoin has demonstrated its capacity to recover and reach new heights. This resilience is a testament to its fundamental value proposition and growing adoption. The current Bitcoin price movement is part of this larger narrative of growth and maturation. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Trajectory? Predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is challenging, given the dynamic nature of the crypto market. However, several indicators and expert sentiments can offer clues about potential future trajectories. Many analysts believe that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its adoption cycle. As more individuals and institutions recognize its value as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional financial instability, demand could continue to rise. Furthermore, the halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically precede significant bull runs. While the immediate impact of a halving isn’t always instant, its long-term effects on supply-demand dynamics are undeniable. However, it’s also prudent to consider potential headwinds. Increased regulatory scrutiny, global economic downturns, or significant technological breakthroughs in competing assets could introduce volatility. Therefore, while the current sentiment around the Bitcoin price is overwhelmingly positive, a cautious and informed approach remains paramount. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor As the Bitcoin price continues its exciting journey, here are some actionable insights for investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and risk factors. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate risk from price volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is dominant, exploring other promising cryptocurrencies can spread risk and potentially capture gains from different sectors of the market. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to protect your investments from cyber threats. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and market analysis to stay updated on trends and developments that could impact the Bitcoin price . The journey with Bitcoin is often a marathon, not a sprint. Patience and a well-thought-out strategy are your best allies. The recent surge of the Bitcoin price above $119,000 is a powerful reminder of its enduring appeal and growing significance in the global financial landscape. While the path ahead may be volatile, Bitcoin’s proven resilience, coupled with increasing institutional adoption and a robust community, positions it as a compelling asset for the future. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto world, this milestone underscores the importance of staying informed and strategic in your approach to this fascinating digital frontier. The excitement is palpable, and the journey of Bitcoin continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Bitcoin price reaching $119,000 mean for the crypto market? A1: The Bitcoin price reaching $119,000 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. It often signals strong bullish sentiment, attracts new investors, and can lead to a broader market rally as altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead. It reinforces confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value. Q2: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this price surge? A2: It’s never truly ‘too late’ to consider investing in Bitcoin, but it’s crucial to understand the risks. While the Bitcoin price has surged, market volatility means corrections can occur. Many long-term investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk rather than trying to time the market. Q3: What factors primarily influence the Bitcoin price? A3: The Bitcoin price is influenced by a combination of factors including supply and demand dynamics, institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions (like inflation or interest rates), regulatory developments, technological advancements within the network, and overall market sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s halving event affect its price? A4: Bitcoin’s halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the reward miners receive for validating transactions by half. This effectively halves the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, decreasing supply. Historically, these events have been followed by significant bull runs in the Bitcoin price due to increased scarcity. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? A5: Key risks include high price volatility, regulatory uncertainty that could impact its legality or use, security risks (like hacking if not stored properly), and the potential for market manipulation. It’s essential to only invest what you can afford to lose and to conduct thorough due diligence.

2025-07-21T14:14:59,"Bitcoin OTC Reserves Nose-Dive, Hinting at Tightening Supply","Over the past few years, Bitcoin held on OTC (over‑the‑counter) desks—a private market favored by big buyers like hedge funds, corporations, and governments—has plunged from around 480 000 BTC in September 2021 to roughly 146 000 BTC now. This drawdown continued even after BTC crossed the $100 000 mark, demonstrating strong and steady demand Crypto News Land+5TradingView+5Mitrade+5 . Experts from CryptoQuant (via analyst Darkfost) suggest this shift may be a warning sign. As OTC liquidity dries up, institutional buyers may move to public exchanges, which could unleash volatility due to slippage and thinner order books. Meanwhile, U.S. exchanges collectively hold almost 1 million BTC in sell-side inventory — a large pool, but poised to be taxed further if OTC tapers off. Miners also currently hold about 117 000 BTC off-exchange. If these reserves are sold, it would further tighten supply. Plus, on‑chain metrics like Hash Ribbons have shown signs of miner capitulation, hinting they may liquidate as well. On the flip side, dwindling OTC supply might indicate growing long-term accumulation , potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout once demand shifts to exchanges",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/otc-reserves-falling,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare

2025-07-21T14:12:36,"Ethereum’s lost supply reaches a staggering 913,111 ETH","Ethereum’s lost supply has reached a staggering 913,111 ETH, according to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan. The amount, now worth about 0.76% of the circulating supply of Ethereum, was attributed to bugs, incorrect contracts, and mistakes in user activity. The losses exceed $3.43 billion at rates held in its current market of around $3,822. As noted by Grogan, this estimate only counts permanently unused ETH, e.g., tokens caught in contracts or burned addresses. It does not include the lost ETH due to forgotten private keys and inactive Genesis wallets, so the actual value may be much larger. Based on my research, a minimum of 913,111 Ethereum is lost forever due to user error. This is 0.76%+ of ETH supply, or $3.43 billion in lost funds If we include EIP‑1559 burned ETH (5.3M), then >5% of all ETH ever made ($23.42B) have been permanently destroyed pic.twitter.com/IlTduN7Kzx — Conor (@jconorgrogan) July 20, 2025 With the destruction of 5.3 million ETH through the Ethereum EIP-1559 system, the total Ethereum removed from circulation effectively surpasses 6 million tokens. This constitutes approximately 4-5% of the 120.7 million total supply. The largest loss events remain consistent with Grogan’s 2023 analysis. These include 306,000 ETH lost to the Parity Multisig bug, 60,000 ETH trapped in a QuadrigaCX contract, and 11,500 ETH lost in the Akutars NFT mint failure. There have been minimal changes since last year, and 1,000 more ETH have been sent to burn addresses. Total losses of ETH caused by these mistakes have increased by 44 percent since March 2023, when the figure was 636,000 ETH. “To be clear, this $3.4 billion number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount — it just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever.” – Conor Grogan Ethereum supply dynamics support bullish thesis The tokenomics of Ethereum have grown more deflationary. Following the Merge in September 2022, the issuance of ETH was significantly reduced as the network technology changed to proof-of-stake. In 2021, EIP-1559 decreased its available supply by burning a small percentage of transaction fees. Prior to the Merge, Ethereum had a total amount of 120.5 million ETH. It has slowly dropped since then, but has since picked up gradual growth in 2024 at 120.7 million. Although Ethereum has no maximum limit, like Bitcoin, its slower issuance has kept inflation at bay. Market participants view this supply tendency as one of the reasons for long-term price increases. According to Lookonchain, Ethereum whales have purchased more than $2.7 billion worth of ETH within a week. According to analysts, the measure is an indication of growing market control and regulatory transparency. ETH gains momentum Ethereum’s price has surged 57.6% over the past month, climbing to a local high of $3,834. It now trades just above $3,800, with analysts expecting a clean breakout past $4,000 if current momentum holds. Whale accumulation, growing institutional interest, and positive regulatory signals are fueling Ethereum’s strong recovery. The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, has introduced a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which benefits ETH, Solana, and other L1 networks. Ethereum’s market share has climbed from 9.7% to 11.6%, while Bitcoin’s dominance dropped from 64% to 60%. QCP Capital pointed to this shift as a sign that altcoins are outperforming and that ETH is leading the charge. ETH perpetual open interest has jumped from $18 billion to over $28 billion in one week. QCP also highlighted that ETH spot ETF inflows have outpaced Bitcoin for two consecutive days, marking a rare shift in institutional behavior. Analysts expect Ethereum’s price to break out of its macro range between $2,200 and $3,900. According to Rekt Capital, ETH has rebounded 120% from a key historical demand zone and is preparing to test the upper boundary of that range. A successful breakout could open the door to new highs. $ETH Ethereum has long ago resynchronised with its $2200-$3900 Macro Range In fact, it has rallied +120% since the reversal from the light blue historical demand area and is soon to challenge the very top of this Macro Range (red) #ETH #Crypto #Ethereum https://t.co/bzSwVKGufp pic.twitter.com/a3JOU32JXj — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 20, 2025 Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
