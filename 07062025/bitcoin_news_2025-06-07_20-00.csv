2025-06-07T17:30:50,"Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead?","Solana (SOL) is showing resilience amid broader market weakness, as volatility shakes crypto assets across the board. After a sharp retrace alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is stabilizing above key demand levels, sparking cautious optimism among investors. Many are eyeing this zone as a potential launchpad for the next leg up, especially as the market seeks to recover and regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Despite recent uncertainty, sentiment around Solana remains constructive. Analysts point to strong structural support and a history of sharp rebounds from similar technical setups. Among them, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a key signal that has caught the attention of traders: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal for Solana on the daily timeframe. Historically, this signal has preceded notable price rallies, particularly when it aligns with strong support zones. With Solana holding firm and broader sentiment gradually improving, bulls are watching closely for a push into higher supply zones. If confirmed, a breakout from this range could send SOL toward new short-term highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Solana can sustain this momentum and lead the next altcoin rally. Solana Tests Support As TD Sequential Signals Rebound Solana is holding a critical support zone near $145 after shedding more than 20% of its value since late May. The correction has brought SOL into a key demand area, where bulls appear to be defending the level with strength. Despite attempts to reclaim $160, the altcoin has faced persistent resistance, with fading momentum and rising macro risks clouding short-term price action. Market-wide conditions haven’t helped either. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have stalled below key resistance zones, failing to spark a broader rally in altcoins. This hesitation has intensified uncertainty, with some analysts calling for a deeper retracement in SOL if market leaders continue to slide. However, others remain optimistic that Solana could soon turn the tide. A key signal for Solana has emerged, with analyst Martinez reporting that the TD Sequential indicator printed a buy signal on the daily chart. Historically, this indicator has been a reliable precursor to significant local bottoms and bullish reversals, particularly when seen near strong support levels. With SOL recently experiencing a selloff and now stabilizing, this signal underscores the growing bullish potential. For now, Solana’s ability to hold above $145 will be key. A bounce from this level, combined with improving sentiment across large-cap assets, could trigger a fresh push toward $160 and beyond. If confirmed, such a move would signal that SOL is regaining strength and ready to retest higher resistance levels in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally SOL Retests Support After Prolonged Correction Solana (SOL) is trading at $148.44 after attempting a modest rebound from its recent local low near $145. The daily chart shows that SOL has lost momentum since peaking above $180 in late May, marking a 20% correction. Price is now holding just above the 100-day moving average (144.68), a key technical level that previously acted as support during consolidation phases. The 50-day and 34-day moving averages are now trending downward, with the 50-day SMA around $159.33 and the 34-day EMA near $159.35 — both acting as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA remains higher at $177.49, reinforcing the presence of a strong overhead supply zone between $160 and $180. Despite the bearish pressure, volume has remained relatively muted during the recent drop, suggesting that panic selling hasn’t taken over yet. If SOL manages to hold above the $144–$145 region, this could form the base for a rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves.

2025-06-07T17:30:08,"Will Elon Musk Pick XRP Over Dogecoin For X Payments? Market Expert Answers","Market expert Joshua Dalton has given his opinion on what cryptocurrency the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is likely to pick for his X payments . Dogecoin has, for a while now, been rumored to be the crypto that will get the nod, but Dalton has explained why Musk might choose XRP instead. Musk Could Choose XRP Over Dogecoin In an X post , Dalton said he believes Elon Musk will do anything to make XRP a chosen one and use it, instead of Dogecoin, on X. The expert is confident that the world’s richest man will make this move, knowing that the Trump family will watch their crypto ventures and Bitcoin crash before their eyes. Dalton was alluding to the clash between Musk and Trump , in which the world’s richest man has openly criticized the US president over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill.’ The expert believes that Musk is likely to take a step further in his feud with Trump by choosing XRP, probably given the discord between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. The Trump family has shown their affinity for Bitcoin, with Eric Trump the co-founder of America Bitcoin, a BTC mining firm. The president’s company, Trump Media, recently raised $2.5 billion, which it intends to use to create a Bitcoin Treasury Reserve. Truth Social has also filed for a Bitcoin ETF. As such, Dalton predicts that Musk will choose to join the other side of the divide by picking XRP for his X payments rather than Bitcoin or Dogecoin. Interestingly, amid the Trump-Musk clash, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has urged the world’s richest man to go all in on BTC rather than picking XRP or any other crypto asset. He further encouraged Musk to allow Tesla to begin receiving payments in BTC while SpaceX can offer discounts on payments made with the leading crypto. Musk chose not to speak about XRP when he was asked about it during a Town Hall meeting last year . On the other hand, Musk once jokingly described ‘Bitcoin’ as his safe word, while Tesla holds over 11,000 BTC. Dogecoin is also in the mix for the X payments, given the world’s richest fondness for the meme coin. X Looking To Adopt Stablecoins Instead While the debate continues over whether Musk will choose XRP, Bitcoin, or Dogecoin for X payments, a Fortune report has revealed that the social media platform is exploring the use of stablecoins. The report stated that the firm is already holding early talks with crypto firms, including payment processor Stripe, about integrating stablecoins . Specifically, Musk and his platform are discussing how to integrate stablecoins into the payments app ‘X Money.’ The social media platform is said to view stablecoin adoption as a means to lower transaction costs and optimize cross-border payments. This raises questions about whether Musk will enable support for other cryptos, such as XRP or Dogecoin.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-over-dogecoin-for-x-payments/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|American Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin ETF|dogecoin|Elon Musk|Eric Trump|Joshua Dalton|meme coin|Samson Mow|SpaceX|Stablecoins|Stripe|Trump Media|Truth Social|X Payments|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T17:24:13,"Expert sets Bitcoin price for Q3 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be on track to reach a new all-time high in the third quarter of 2025, according to insights comparing its trading patterns to those of gold . In this case, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows highlighted this parallel, noting similarities between Bitcoin’s current price behavior and gold’s historical rally, he said in an X post on June 7. In his breakdown, Pillows explained that Bitcoin appears to follow the same sequence of market phases gold experienced before its major breakout. He noted that gold went through a distribution phase, followed by years of accumulation between 2013 and 2018. It then entered a re-accumulation phase after 2020, leading to a sharp rally to record highs of around $3,500. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to Pillows, Bitcoin is mirroring that path. After peaking in 2021, BTC underwent a steep correction, followed by an accumulation phase throughout 2022 and 2023. In 2024, Bitcoin entered what Pillows described as a re-accumulation phase, gaining momentum and breaking higher. If the pattern holds, it could enter a rally phase similar to gold’s before its surge. Pillows noted that both assets corrected after hitting new highs, reinforcing the comparison. To this end, the expert projects that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025. “BTC is perfectly mimicking Gold’s rally. Gold also had a correction after hitting the new ATH, and the same happened with BTC. I think BTC will hit $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025,” Pillows said. While the price patterns align, Bitcoin and gold remain fundamentally different. The precious metal is a centuries-old store of value, while Bitcoin is still evolving. Still, both have shown strong momentum in 2025. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch Meanwhile, a separate analysis by RLinda , published on TradingView on July 7, highlighted key Bitcoin technical levels to monitor. She noted that BTC is recovering after a liquidity sweep of nearly $100,000, though the short-term outlook remains mixed. While the broader trend is bullish, the market is in a corrective phase with a bearish structure below key resistance. Bitcoin is currently testing the $105,900 and $106,720 zones. If buying momentum weakens, a rejection here could drop the price to $103,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView However, RLinda noted that a sustained move above $105,500 could revive bullish momentum and push prices toward $110,400, assuming support holds. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,660, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The current price sits comfortably above its 50-day ($100,893) and 200-day ($87,224) simple moving averages ( SMA ), indicating continued bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 51.09, signaling neutral market conditions, with no immediate signs of the asset being overbought or oversold.

2025-06-07T17:21:01,"Coinbase, BiT Global End Legal Fight Over WBTC Delisting","Coinbase and BiT Global have reached a legal settlement that ended their dispute over the delisting of BiT Global’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) token on Coinbase. According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against the crypto exchange with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be brought again in the future. The filing notes that both companies will cover their own legal expenses. BiT Global had filed the lawsuit last year in the Northern District of California after Coinbase delisted the token over what it said was “unacceptable risk” that the tokenized BTC would “fall into the hands of Justin Sun.” Sun became affiliated with wBTC in August last year through a partnership, prompting Coinbase to question BiT Global about his role. Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has nevertheless been supporting the token, with World Liberty Financial dropping its cbBTC for wBTC after he joined as an advisor. The suit alleged the exchange’s decision was unjustified and harmed the token's liquidity and reputation while favoring Coinbase’s competing asset cbBTC. Coinbase launched cbBTC just two months before announcing it was delisting wBTC.

2025-06-07T17:00:14,"Top Presale Crypto Projects: BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Snorter & Best Wallet Token Take the Lead","Presale crypto projects are drawing fresh interest in 2025, offering more than just hype. With utilities in place and early access pricing, many of these coins could see major gains after launch. From privacy-focused wallets to mining-enabled platforms, these early-stage cryptos are shaping a new wave of adoption. If you’re searching for the best performing crypto today, these presale crypto projects might be the best place to look. Each brings a unique utility, and they’re gaining traction fast. Here’s a look at BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Snorter, and Best Wallet Token and why they stand out. 1. BlockDAG – Hybrid Tech with Strong Mining Support BlockDAG is setting a new bar among presale crypto projects by mixing blockchain and DAG structures. This design allows for faster transactions and scalable performance. It also supports Ethereum tools and smart contract creation with low-code setup. Developers and users alike find it easy to access. Its mining features are just as impressive. BlockDAG miners, including the X1 mobile miner and X100 ASIC, are efficient and profitable. These devices can produce as much as 2,000 BDAG coins per day, helping both newcomers and advanced users. BlockDAG has now raised over $288.5 million and sold more than 22 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, marking a 2,520% return since batch 1. The current frozen price is $0.0018, valid until June 13, offering an even bigger 2,678% potential gain. The launch price is set at $0.05. So far, 17,700+ ASIC miners have been sold. With real-time mining activity and fast-growing adoption, BlockDAG is among the best performing crypto projects in the presale space. 2. BTC Bull – Built to Mirror Bitcoin’s Momentum BTC Bull is one of the few presale crypto projects designed to track Bitcoin movement while adding its own rewards twist. Traders are drawn to it for its gamified design, which includes incentive loops and events. This keeps activity high even when Bitcoin slows. With a presale price of $0.009 and over $5.6 million raised, BTC Bull is moving fast. Only a small portion of its supply is left, and that’s increasing the demand. Should Bitcoin surge again, BTC Bull could benefit directly. Those following the best performing crypto today see this project as a strong short-term prospect with fast action potential. 3. Snorter – Community and Fun Rolled Into One Snorter is shaking up the meme space by tying fun to real interaction. This presale crypto project rewards users for engaging in community activities like sharing memes and voting. The token has built-in deflationary mechanics and keeps value growing through activity. Now in its fourth presale stage, Snorter is priced at $0.00062 and has already raised $3.1 million. More features, such as SnorterBoards and meme battles, will go live after launch. Those seeking the best performing crypto today with low entry points and real engagement are giving Snorter a serious look. 4. Best Wallet Token – Privacy Meets Real Utility Best Wallet Token is focused on delivering actual services to users. As the native coin of a Web3 wallet, it covers everything from fiat on-ramps to built-in staking. Its main draw, though, is privacy. The wallet includes a stealth mode for masked transactions, which is timely as more users demand better protection. Currently in Stage 5 with a $0.0043 price tag, Best Wallet Token has raised more than $7.2 million. Early adopters will get higher APYs for staking in-wallet. If you’re checking the best performing crypto today based on use and privacy, this one has strong appeal. Key Insights With renewed focus on utility and strong entry prices, presale crypto projects are proving to be the hot picks of 2025. BTC Bull is capitalizing on Bitcoin trends, while Snorter adds community fun with real value. Best Wallet Token offers privacy-backed use, but BlockDAG continues to lead with $288.5 million raised, 22 billion coins sold, and fast-selling mining hardware. The GO LIVE reveal on June 13 will mark BlockDAG’s debut on 20 major platforms, positioning it well for growth. If you’re tracking the best performing crypto today, these four presales all deserve attention, but BlockDAG is clearly ahead of the curve.

According to a preliminary approval order , Illinois-based Midland States Bank will pay $3.125 million to settle accusations that the billion-dollar lender and two other banks it acquired improperly charged overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. Specifically, the class action lawsuit alleged that Midland States Bank by its practices engaged in “Breach of Contract and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unjust Enrichment, and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.” The two banks the lender acquired are Centrue Bank and Alpine Bank & Trust. Beneficiaries of the settlement will be customers of Midland State Bank, or the lenders it acquired, who had a checking account between April 8th of 2012 and April 30th of 2022. Plaintiffs could receive up to $10,000, per the settlement agreement. According to the preliminary approval order, the settlement Midland States Bank has reached with the plaintiffs is not an admission of guilt. Class members who wish to object to the settlement must communicate in writing to the court by August 11th. To opt out of the settlement, class members must write to the settlement administrator by the same date. A final approval hearing will be held on September 10th. Per the Federal Reserve, Midland States Bank held approximately $7.45 billion in total assets as of December of 2024.

2025-06-07T16:12:36,"UK Lifting Crypto ETF Ban May Not Boost Demand, Analyst Says","The United Kingdom is taking a big step in its approach to crypto ETFs and related investments. Announced on June 6, the government plans to lift the ban on retail investors buying Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to give more people access to crypto-based financial products. However, industry experts remain cautious about whether this change will significantly grow demand among UK retail investors. FCA’s Proposal to Open Crypto ETFs to Retail Investors The FCA recently proposed allowing retail investors to purchase crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). This high-risk investment type tracks the price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These ETNs will be listed on FCA-recognized exchanges, providing a new avenue for everyday investors to participate in the crypto market. The regulator emphasized that lifting the ban is part of a strategy to balance risk. The regulator wants investors to choose if these risky investments are right for them, instead of banning the product completely. This proposal follows shortly after BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, registered with the FCA as a crypto asset firm. This move signals growing institutional interest in the UK crypto market. Crypto ETFs See Global Adoption Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are becoming more popular worldwide, especially in the United States. U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have seen inflows for three weeks in a row, and recent data shows that more investors are starting to trust Ethereum-backed products. Also, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has gained strong interest from investors. Over two weeks, steady investments totaled more than $800 million. This comes as large firms and institutional investors continue to show growing interest in the financial investment vehicle . Analyst Says Retail Demand Likely to Stay Moderate Following the news, Eric Balchunas, an expert on ETFs at Bloomberg, shared his opinion. He said he does not expect the new rules to increase UK retail demand for crypto ETFs. He explained that European investors, including those in the UK, usually show less interest in crypto and ETFs than Americans. Balchunas noted that while the U.K. has experienced growth in crypto adoption , high fees on crypto products might eventually discourage investors. Nevertheless, some people in the industry feel hopeful. They think the FCA’s decision is important in giving UK investors more ways to invest in crypto. Although the UK crypto rules are becoming clear, it remains to be seen if more investors will take the chance on these new products or remain cautious.

MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.161. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops at $0.23. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

2025-06-07T16:00:11,"Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal – What To Expect Next","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of repeating a historic Golden Cross pattern that led to a long-term parabolic run. While the cryptocurrency’s recent pullback near the $100,000 region may have alarmed the crypto market, analysts suggest that this move is part of a broader trend that could push BTC to its next price high. Golden Cross Formation Pits Bitcoin At $150,000 Bitcoin has once again flashed a classic bullish signal, the Golden Cross, prompting renewed optimism for a major price rally in the coming months. According to a technical analysis by ‘Chain Mind,’ a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin may be on the verge of an explosive surge to $150,000 if this historical pattern plays out as expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over The last time BTC formed this pattern was in November 2024. Immediately after the cross’s completion, Bitcoin’s price experienced a 10% correction, followed by a sharp 62% rally over the next several weeks. This behavior established a clear trend of a short-term shake-out preceding a strong bullish continuation. Now, in early June 2025, Bitcoin has printed another Golden Cross on its chart, and so far, price action appears to be closely mirroring the one from the previous year. Notably, Bitcoin has dropped 8%, suggesting a smaller but comparable corrective phase to the one observed in 2024. Technical projections from Chain Minds now show a possible 51% rally on the horizon from the post-correction bottom. This would potentially place Bitcoin in the $150,000 range by the end of 2025. Notably, Chain Mind’s analysis identifies Bitcoin’s recent crash toward the $100,000 region as a potential local bottom, with the Golden Cross acting as the catalyst for the next leg of the bull run. If the current historical pattern holds, Bitcoin may be entering a sustained period of upward movement to new all-time highs. With the cryptocurrency already recovering from the brief downturn and now trading at $105,050, a 51% increase would potentially place its price at approximately $158,625 once the historical Golden Cross pattern is fully completed. Bitcoin Uptrend At Risk If $100,000 Level Is Lost Despite the broader bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, its price is currently navigating a critical trading range between $100,000 and $112,049, which analysts suggest is crucial for maintaining its current optimistic outlook. Crypto Fella, the market expert responsible for this analysis, has shown via a chart that BTC is consolidating within a rectangular band, reflecting a pause in momentum after a sharp upward move earlier in the quarter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That’s Forming The crypto analyst has boldly asserted that as long as Bitcoin continues to trade within the range above, there should be little cause for concern for another major crash. However, if the $100,000 mark fails to hold, the next likely target for downside movement is between $97,000 and $95,000, representing a 9.56% and 7.66% decline from current levels, respectively.

2025-06-07T15:56:40,"The $15 Investment That Could Make You Rich: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Changes Everything","In 2013, a $15 Bitcoin purchase didn’t mean much to most people. Today, that same buy would be worth hundreds of thousands. What those early adopters understood wasn’t just the idea of Bitcoin — it was the power of timing. Not hype. Not speculation. Mechanics. That moment may never return for Bitcoin. But it’s beginning again for Bitcoin Solaris. The Nova App, the project’s mobile-first mining gateway, allows anyone with a modern smartphone to contribute idle CPU and storage to earn BTC-S tokens. There’s no GPU farm, no locked staking. Just a device and a connection. Entry? As little as a few bucks. Turning Phones Into Earning Engines Bitcoin Solaris flips the mining model on its head. Where traditional networks depend on high-capital nodes and complex validator structures, BTC-S runs on an architecture optimized for everyday participation. Through the Nova App, phones run background operations that contribute to block validation. This creates yield not in theory, but in real time. Closed beta testers have already demonstrated the power of that simplicity, reporting consistent weekly earnings from passive phone usage alone. That kind of performance isn’t common in new-layer protocols. It’s even rarer when it happens before exchange listings. And with phase 6 of the presale active at $6 per token, even small investments today open the door to protocol-level rewards — without the usual bottlenecks or dependencies. What Makes This Model Work? Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t scale through brute force. Its strength comes from separation of function. The base layer secures the network through a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity — mechanisms that keep energy costs low while maintaining robust consensus. On top of that, the Solaris Layer processes transactions with Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time, two clock-based systems designed for speed and precision. That separation allows the network to reach over 10,000 transactions per second without congestion. Finality settles in around two seconds. These figures aren’t ideal conditions or load-tested projections. They reflect what the system is engineered to maintain under real usage. And because the design limits the burden placed on individual devices, it opens the door for phones to play a role in consensus. This approach solves a long-standing issue in blockchain design. Most networks either require validators with constant uptime or miners with high hashpower. Both models create entry barriers. Bitcoin Solaris avoids that by shifting emphasis from raw output to consistent, verifiable contribution. When a phone provides idle storage or computing bandwidth, it’s supporting the system. That support is measured and rewarded through direct token distribution. Audited, Verified, and Fully Transparent Security isn’t a footnote in the Bitcoin Solaris model. It’s central. The Nova App has already passed a full Freshcoins audit , confirming its technical architecture, mining logic, and efficiency assumptions. On the protocol level, Cyberscope completed a comprehensive code review of smart contracts and consensus structures. And team identity verification has been completed through KYC documentation , adding another layer of accountability. This is the kind of transparency that simply doesn’t exist in early-stage mobile projects. And according to Crypto Volt’s breakdown , that’s exactly why Bitcoin Solaris stands out in a saturated landscape of speculative coins and hype-based launches. The Tokenomics That Lock In Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has a hard cap of 21 million tokens. That figure isn’t symbolic — it defines the economics of the entire network. No additional tokens will ever be minted. No emissions curve, no inflation schedule, and no backend wallet allocations. The rules are fixed, and that certainty shapes every decision around acquisition and participation. Out of the full supply, 4.2 million BTC-S are allocated to the presale. That’s a one-time distribution window — not a recurring release. Anyone buying in now is acquiring tokens before broader network access, before centralized exchange liquidity, and before the mining rollout scales competition. It’s not just about getting a better price — it’s about starting with a stronger position. At $6 during phase 6, early buyers are operating at a fraction of the exchange listing benchmark, which is targeting $20 based on network growth and liquidity provisioning. But more importantly, holding tokens at this stage isn’t passive. Once the Nova App goes live, those tokens secure access to mining rewards. Early accumulation leads to early earnings — and in a system built on capped supply, that advantage doesn’t level out over time. It compounds. This model rewards participation, not speculation. Price movement may draw attention later, but the real economic value is already forming through protocol access. Each user entering now locks in a role before the wider market shifts the balance. Crypto Isn’t Dead. Access Was. Until Now. The barriers that once defined crypto access don’t apply here. $15 — the cost of just a few BTC-S tokens — gives users a real position in an operational mining ecosystem. The Nova App turns idle smartphone resources into income. The device you already own becomes a functional part of the protocol. Beta testers running early versions of the app reported earnings that rivaled — and in some cases outperformed — browser-based miners and leading staking platforms. The difference is accessibility. Instead of tying rewards to who has the most capital or tech knowledge, Bitcoin Solaris ties them to contribution. That’s what makes the $15 entry point meaningful. It’s not a lottery ticket or a speculative flyer — it’s a working gateway into the protocol’s economy. The earlier you start, the more you compound returns before broader network demand increases competition and shifts pricing.

2025-06-07T15:45:51,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $105,000 As Markets Recover","Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $105,000, making a strong recovery after dropping to an intraday low of $101,201 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2%, trading around the $105,071 mark. BTC’s drop to $100,000 wiped out over $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours as traders rushed to sell. Analysts believe BTC’s decline has been sustained by long-term holders locking in their profits. Bitcoin (BTC) Turns Bearish Amid Political Tensions Bitcoin (BTC) dipped sharply on Friday, plunging 3% to hit a low of $100,421 as political tensions between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk escalated. However, it has recovered since, regaining its position above $105,000. The price action reflects increased volatility across crypto after an acrimonious escalation of tensions between President Trump and Musk. The tensions triggered a risk-off sentiment heading into the weekend as the global crypto market cap plunged over 4%, and Bitcoin fell to $100,000, with market watchers sweating over a further decline. According to data from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, the Binance net taker volume fell from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours, indicating a sharp change in investor sentiment. The analyst emphasized that this was the largest intraday net-taker volume reversal observed on the exchange this year. The shift shows how quickly sentiment changes if influential figures or macro-narratives dominate headlines. Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action Bitcoin has recovered after Thursday’s dip, rising back above $105,000 during the ongoing session. While BTC has recovered, the broader crypto market is still digesting the fallout. However, CryptoQuant analysts have pointed out another factor that could decide the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the amount of BTC transferred to exchanges. Miner-to-exchange inflows crossed $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. These inflows are often seen as a proxy for miners’ preparing to sell their holdings. This could significantly impact BTC’s short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to the flagship cryptocurrency’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. “Paying close attention to these inflows—especially during historical peaks like the current phase—can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Thursday, falling to an intraday low of $100,421 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. Sentiment turned bearish following an ugly spat between President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. However, the decline was short-lived as BTC rebounded on Friday to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,378. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but has declined and is currently trading around $104,799. Despite the decline, analysts believe a pullback was expected and could trigger a move to fresh all-time highs. According to an analysis, BTC follows a similar path after each halving. The analyst pointed out that BTC rose around 280% a year after the 2016 halving and 550% a year after the 2020 halving. During the current cycle, BTC has climbed around 70% since the halving. According to Klarch, price action has picked up after a slow start during previous cycles, indicating there is more room for growth. According to the analyst, BTC’s recent all-time high is a milestone that marks the beginning of a move higher. BTC has multiple tops before it hits the cycle’s real peak. BTC started the previous week positively but was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662.

2025-06-07T15:38:35,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-7: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, Ripple: XRP","The crypto market registered a sharp recovery on Friday after Thursday’s sudden drop. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,811 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. However, the decline was short-lived as the price rebounded on Friday to erase most of the previous day’s losses and settle above $104,378. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1%, trading at around $105,128. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has struggled after Thursday’s decline, which saw the price dip below $2,400. However, it has struggled to regain momentum and has registered only a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 2%, trading around $151. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 6%, and Cardano (ADA) is up over 3%, trading around $0.668. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable increases. Gemini Confidentially Files for US IPO Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss brothers, has disclosed it confidentially filed for an IPO as crypto exchanges attempt to take advantage of renewed market momentum. Several high-profile companies, including crypto exchanges, have launched successful listings, indicating growing demand and renewed vigor in the capital markets. Recently, USDC issuer Circle went public, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital, stated, “Pre-IPO crypto companies would be crazy not to move ahead with listings after seeing how Circle traded. Crypto can be an unpredictable market, so when you get a chance like this, you take it.” The recent spate of IPOs heralds a turning point for the industry, reflecting growing confidence among digital asset firms to attract mainstream investors. It also suggests companies are confident about meeting transparency, regulatory, and capital requirements. Gemini has not determined the size or the proposed range for its offering. Kat Liu, vice president at IPOX stated, “Gemini's move contributes to the broader momentum and reinforces the idea that crypto-native firms are increasingly preparing to access public markets. More broadly, this signals that long-anticipated firms are now ready to reengage with public capital.” Singapore’s Ousted Crypto Firms Have Nowhere To Go Singapore recently passed an order prohibiting unlicensed crypto firms from serving overseas customers. The order marks the beginning of the end for regulatory loopholes in the blockchain industry. The directive, issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, orders crypto firms offering services abroad to get licensed or leave. The movie aligns with a broader global push for compliance and cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing. Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Blockchain Alliance, stated, “For exchanges still playing regulatory pinball — constantly seeking loopholes to avoid licensing requirements — the reality is clear: They will soon find themselves having to relocate to their favorite destination, the moon. With jurisdictions like Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, Hong Kong, and others tightening oversight and closing gaps, there’s simply no escaping the global push for compliance.” Some in the crypto space have interpreted the recent order as a sharp policy reversal. However, the regular said it has always maintained a steady stance. Singapore’s Central Bank stated, “MAS’ position on this has been consistently communicated for a few years since the first response to public consultation issued on February 14, 2022, and in subsequent publications on October 4, 2024, and May 302025.” Dow Jones Rises On Back Of Strong Market Data Wall Street ended the week positively after better-than-expected job numbers boosted investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443 points, leading Friday’s gains among major indices. The S&P 500 rose 1.03% to close above 6000 for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2% thanks to a major rebound in tech stocks. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US added 139,000 jobs in May, above the expected 125,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, while the wage growth also came in higher than expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from Thursday’s dramatic decline to register an increase of nearly 3% on Friday and recoup a significant chunk of the previous day’s losses. The flagship cryptocurrency has extended its gains in the current session and has reclaimed $105,000 to trade around $105,150. Analysts believe miner activity could impact BTC’s near-term outlook. According to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, miners have increased the volume of BTC transferred to crypto exchanges. According to the analysis, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. Analysts view such inflows as a proxy for miners intending to sell their assets. This could impact short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to BTC’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. BTC started the previous week positively, registering a marginal increase on Monday. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The price declined on Friday, dropping 1.51%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067.

2025-06-07T15:35:50,"Outset PR Reports LATAM Crypto Media Reach Becoming Centralized in Q1 2025 as 73% of Outlets Lost Traffic","In the first quarter of 2025, Latin America’s crypto media ecosystem had one of its roughest stretches in recent memory. New research from Outset PR, an agency known for its data-driven, boutique approach to PR in Web3 , shows that 73% of active crypto news outlets in the region saw traffic decline in Q1 2025. Just six crypto-native publications accounted for 69% of total traffic across the crypto-only segment. The report — based on SimilarWeb data from 55 tracked LATAM media sites — paints a stark picture of media contraction. Once-reliable names lost ground, some disappearing from the radar altogether. Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s January rally and early-year bullish momentum didn’t translate into sustained audience growth. Instead, a mix of macro headwinds, market corrections, and Google’s March algorithm update created a perfect storm, hitting crypto-focused sites hardest — especially those lacking strong SEO strategies or diversified content models. Media Instability Escalates Amid Market Turmoil In January 2025, Bitcoin briefly surged past $109,000, fueled by institutional inflows and broader optimism around U.S. economic policy. But the rally proved short-lived. By February, a wave of exploit-driven panic, meme coin collapses, and shaky sentiment pulled the market into a sharp correction. The downturn hit the media landscape just as hard. Advertising budgets contracted, user interest waned, and Google’s March 2025 algorithm update wiped visibility from many LATAM-focused crypto outlets — especially those relying on outdated SEO tactics or thin content. According to Outset PR’s tracking , 21.8% of the 55 monitored outlets gained traffic in February, while a staggering 78.18% saw declines. Performance snapshot of LATAM crypto outlets in February 2025, as reported by Outset PR Google’s March Update Creates a Visible Divide March brought more instability — both in markets and media. Bitcoin spent most of the month fluctuating between $83,000 and $94,000, with modest rebounds tied to renewed institutional interest and broader macro optimism. Amid price swings, crypto readers turned to the media for clarity. But just as visibility was needed most, Google’s March core algorithm update reshaped how regional publishers ranked in search. The update hit LATAM outlets unevenly. According to Outset PR, 24 of 55 active crypto-focused sites regained some traffic by the end of March. But most remained below their January baselines. Outset PR data showing March 2025 traffic trends for LATAM crypto media A sharp divide emerged: agile players optimized quickly and adapted, while others continued their downward spiral. Notably, CryptoNews Brasil went offline entirely for Brazilian users , likely due to government-imposed access restrictions tied to new regulations targeting offshore betting platforms. The site remains accessible in Europe, but its LATAM visibility has vanished. Finance News Sites Outrank Crypto-Native Brands in Traffic, But Offer Limited Crypto Depth According to the report, all the top Latin American media sites with crypto coverage are web portals for finance and general news. They regularly got millions of visits but mentioned crypto mostly during periods when it was on an uptrend — losing interest when the hype died down. The bulk of these platforms operate in Brazil and Argentina , and they make many content choices based on trends in their countries' politics and economies. Therefore, their reports about crypto can be inconsistent. Though macro trends may bring exposure for crypto-based content on these general sites, they typically do not provide the ongoing and meaningful connection that crypto-native platforms can. Six Crypto-Native Outlets Dominate LATAM Visibility A key insight from Outset PR’s Q1 report is the extreme concentration of visibility in the region. Despite the vast number of sites tracked, just six publications accounted for 69.13% of total crypto-native traffic. Q1 2025 media tier segmentation for LATAM crypto outlets, sourced from Outset PR Together, these six outlets drew 4.11 million visits across the quarter. They were the only crypto-native sites to consistently surpass the 400,000 monthly average visits. Their dominance highlights the narrowing field of reliable crypto voices in LATAM, especially as newer or mid-sized players struggle with traffic volatility and indexing issues. The next tier captured traffic in the 130K–270K range. While still influential, these outlets represent a sharp drop in reach. Most fall short of driving large-scale visibility for crypto projects without additional amplification. Beneath this, Outset PR categorized the remaining outlets as long-tail players. Fourteen of them attracted fewer than 10,000 monthly visits. Though potentially useful for SEO or niche audiences, these sites now contribute minimal impact in terms of direct reach. Strategic Takeaways for LATAM Crypto Media Both the size and influence of Latin America’s crypto media landscape are shrinking — and consolidating. What once felt like a sprawling ecosystem is now concentrated in the hands of a few players. Outset PR’s report underscores how quickly visibility can shift. In fast-moving markets like LATAM, media influence doesn’t erode gradually — it can collapse in a matter of weeks. And influence today is about how often an outlet gets indexed, how visible it is in algorithm-driven feeds, whether its audience is real, and how quickly it publishes.

2025-06-07T15:15:06,"$31M Bitcoin Donation to Ross Ulbricht Traced to AlphaBay, Not Silk Road","Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace who was granted clemency by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, received a whopping $31 million Bitcoin donation from an anonymous wallet over the previous weekend. The sizable gift, sent less than five months after Ulbricht’s sentence was commuted, immediately sparked speculation that he had covertly reclaimed old Silk Road earnings. Anonymous Bitcoin Gift to Ross Ulbricht According to the intel shared by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis with WIRED, the 300 BTC donation did not originate from Silk Road at all. Instead, the funds appear to trace back to AlphaBay, a now-defunct darknet market that operated between 2014 and 2017, well after Silk Road’s takedown. AlphaBay, which was reportedly ten times the size of Silk Road at its peak, was known for trafficking in drugs, malware, and illegal services. Phil Larratt, Chainalysis’s director of investigations and a former UK law enforcement official, said there are “reasonable grounds to suspect” the Bitcoin came from someone involved with AlphaBay – likely a former vendor, given the size of the amount. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who had earlier examined the donation, also concluded the funds did not come from Silk Road. Despite the sender’s use of Bitcoin mixing services, ZachXBT traced the BTC to a wallet previously flagged by Chainalysis as connected to illicit activity. He shared his conclusion with WIRED, wherein he noted that the donation itself may be genuine, but “not legitimate funds.” Additional clues suggest the person behind the transfer may have been actively trying to avoid detection: ZachXBT discovered the same individual had previously cashed out other crypto through centralized exchanges in small, spread-out amounts, rather than large single transactions. This behavior is consistent with an effort to evade asset freezing or scrutiny. AlphaBay Crackdown Chainalysis reportedly declined to share specifics on how exactly it linked the donation to AlphaBay. But it is important to note that the firm is widely known for its expertise in mapping illicit activity across blockchain networks and played a crucial role in dismantling the now-defunct marketplace during the multinational law enforcement initiative known as Operation Bayonet, involving the FBI, DEA, and Europol. The crackdown later led to the conviction of Bryan Connor Herrell, an AlphaBay moderator, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison. As for Ulbricht, he has not publicly addressed the donation.

The series aims to push creative boundaries by offering a crypto prize instead of cash. The show launches amid rising security risks for crypto holders, with several high-profile kidnapping attempts reported this year. Netflix’s latest reality venture, House of Streams, is set to debut on June 18 in the UK and Ireland, offering a unique prize, 1 Bitcoin, to the winning contestant. The show will feature eight online streamers with a combined following of four million. According to the official website, the participants, many of whom are well-known on Twitch, will compete in a series of challenges for a chance to take home the Bitcoin, valued at over $104,000 at press time. Why Did Netflix’s New Series Choose Bitcoin Over Cash? While the production is backed by the Malta Film Commission, it remains unclear why the series opted for a crypto prize over traditional rewards. Creator Mark Holland reportedly said the prize “couldn’t have been a simple cash prize or a trip to the Maldives,” hinting at an intent to push boundaries. The show’s producers have also cautioned against scams. A statement released on May 22 clarified, “We support Bitcoin and no other memecoin,” after reports emerged of individuals attempting to launch fraudulent tokens under the show’s name.

So far, the contestants — who include streamers such as The Black Hokage, CyborgAngel, and OutplayedByJade — have yet to comment publicly on their participation. Netflix’s Crypto Show Launches as Security Risks for Holders Rise The show comes amid growing concerns over the risks faced by crypto holders. In May 2024, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was rescued from captivity after French police stormed a suburban Paris location. The suspects had severed one of the victim’s fingers , echoing earlier high-profile attacks involving physical mutilation and digital wallets. Last month, Pierre Noizat, founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, saw his own family targeted. A group of masked men attempted to abduct Noizat’s daughter and grandson in broad daylight. The assault was foiled when the victims and a bystander managed to fight off the attackers. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

After returning to his apartment, the victim was ambushed at gunpoint by three teenagers from Florida. The assailants forced him into their vehicle, covered his head with a towel, and warned him not to look at them. They drove him over 70 miles to a remote desert near White Hills, Arizona. These incidents have intensified calls for better protection for those tied to the crypto world, particularly as rising asset values make high-profile figures more attractive targets.

2025-06-07T14:50:55,"Garantex Moves $15M Despite Tether Freeze, Data Shows","Despite a widely publicized asset freeze by Tether and coordinated sanctions across the world, Russian crypto exchange Garantex has managed to transfer millions of digital assets on the blockchain — demonstrating acute loopholes in the efficacy of crypto blacklists and asset-freezing regimes. According to a recent news report by blockchain forensics firm Glass Ledger, over $15 million worth of reserves linked to Garantex has been actively transferred since March, staying off blacklists by hopping between chains, using mixers like Tornado Cash, and exploiting successor platforms like Grinex. The drama began early in March, when US, German, and Finnish regulators froze $27 million of USDT held by Garantex as part of a sweeping crackdown on the sanctioned exchange. Tether's freeze, which was implemented at the smart contract level, was hailed as a crypto compliance milestone, with regulators trumpeting it as proof that digital assets can be made subject to on-chain blacklists. Garantex, in turn, directly accused Tether of ”declaring war on the Russian crypto market” and shut down temporarily, but first threatened customers it had ”solutions” for individuals with BTC and ETH. How Garantex Funds Kept Moving Later on-chain information revealed that the freeze was only the tip of the iceberg of a new cat-and-mouse game. One of the long-dormant Garantex Ethereum wallets that first raised the eyebrows of compliance experts was revived in March and collected over 3,200 ETH before it flowed $2.3 million through Tornado Cash, a highly respected decentralized mixer used to launder dirty money. The same wallet now holds $6.1 million worth of ETH, while other funds are moved on the Bitcoin and BNB blockchain. Notably, 2.2 BTC was bridged to Tron and partially sent to Grinex, which is the platform commonly regarded as Garantex's operational successor. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun summed up the dilemma: ”The Garantex case bursts the bubble of control so many still carry. $15 million freely available through dark chains and mixers is not a breakdown of law — it's a breakdown of sanction enforcement.” Their latest report details how Garantex exploited the delay between freeze statements and enforcement as well as the inherent limitations of blacklists in the multi-chain universe. The investigative trail doesn't end there. Grinex, now suspected of appropriating Garantex's infrastructure and base of customers, has moved over $1.6 billion on international exchanges in just a few weeks, according to our reporting at Global Ledger. Some of these flows directly or with intermediate hops to major regulated exchanges — raising the red flags of compliance and highlighting the danger even for platforms that have KYC and AML guidelines set up. In one case, $191,000 of USDT was sent directly from a wallet linked to Grinex to a top global exchange, and another $500,000 transfer ended up at an EU VASP in just a single intermediary wallet. What's behind these transactions? Forensic analysts pinpoint several factors: blacklist-based freezing's limitations, delays in operations in Tether's multi-signature freeze mechanism (up to 44 minutes at times, long enough for bad guys to execute withdrawals prior to the freeze taking effect), and Garantex's tactic of hot wallet rotation, use of less-regulated blockchains, and use of cross-chain bridges in order to remain one step ahead of enforcement mechanisms. Besides, Garantex's operating trends changed rapidly following sanctions: they changed address clustering, rerouted transactions to Asian exchanges like HTX and OKX, and began rotating hot wallets more frequently — daily sometimes to evade detection. Compliance Challenges and Industry Response Compliance experts now insist that exchanges go beyond the simple blacklist screening. ”You require real-time blockchain analytics, behavioral risk scoring, and active transaction monitoring,” a leading AML consultant said. ”Otherwise, sanctioned players will always find a way through.” Exchanges are also requested to strengthen onboarding due diligence, flag high-risk flows from known mixers or successor entities, and cooperate with forensics firms for timely identification. The Garantex case has once more fueled controversy surrounding the utilization of decentralized cross-chain bridges and mixers in enabling illicit finance. Although some suspect that mixers have a valid purpose for privacy, their adoption by criminals and sanctioned entities is currently surpassing the industry's ability to freeze and monitor assets, critics argue. The appearance of services such as Grinex, essentially a rebranded Garantex, demonstrates how quickly criminals can adapt, bringing technology and userbases along with them in order to evade enforcement.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9479/garantex-moves-15-m-despite-tether-freeze-data-shows,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT","News|Security",cryptocompare

The Treasury says the $10 billion operation is designed to repurchase securities maturing between July 15th, 2025 and May 31st, 2027. Buybacks allow the Treasury to retire outstanding debt early, potentially reducing interest costs and adjusting its debt profile. This big buyback comes as rising yields increase borrowing costs, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continuing to keep interest rates higher-for-longer. In an April interview with Bloomberg , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about foreign nations fueling a bond market selloff, pointing instead to investors unwinding leveraged positions. At the same time, Bessent specifically called out the Treasury’s ability to increase its buyback program if necessary. When asked whether he’s discussing concerns about the stability of the Treasury market with Powell, Bessent dismissed the notion that there’s any cause for alarm. “Specifically, did we discuss some kind of a break the glass? I think we’re a long way from that.” Historical records indicate the Treasury’s previous largest buyback happened in 2000, at approximately $3 billion.

2025-06-07T14:30:01,"Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says","According to social media buzz, the growing clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the crypto world. Musk’s public swipe at a recent spending bill kicked things off. Then came Trump’s warning to yank Musk’s government contracts. It got messy fast. And now, some believe XRP could come out on top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Elon Musk-Trump Feud Spurs Crypto Talk Musk took to Twitter on June 4 to slam what he called reckless government spending. His post warned of “serious economic risks.” Not long after, Trump fired back. He threatened to pull subsidies and contracts tied to Tesla. That response sent Tesla’s stock tumbling. Investors watched $150 billion in market value vanish in a matter of hours. Market Moves And Price Swings Based on reports, Bitcoin slid more than 5% following the news. It dropped to a low of $100,550 before finding a bit of footing near $102,400. XRP wasn’t spared either. It fell alongside other major coins, though the exact drop varied across exchanges. Traders saw quick declines, then a modest rebound as the dust settled. I believe @elonmusk will do anything to make @Ripple $XRP as a chosen one and use it on @x while knowing that @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and @realDonaldTrump will watch @worldlibertyfi and @bitcoin crashing in front of their eyes. Right, @elonmusk? — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) June 5, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Joshua Dalton, who founded tech services firm TRIBLU, stirred the pot with a bold claim. He suggested Musk might choose XRP as the main currency for X’s upcoming payment system, X Money. Dalton argued that Musk “will do anything” to make XRP the go-to token. He tagged Ripple, Musk, US President Trump, and Trump’s sons in a single post. That move framed the drama as more than just politics—it became a showdown of crypto loyalties. Technical Fit For X Money XRP provides quicker settlement and reduced fees than Bitcoin. In 2021, Musk suspended BTC payments for Tesla due to high energy consumption and centralized mining concerns. That move proved he’s not afraid to change course when a coin isn’t aligned with his objectives. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger In October 2024, Musk even referenced XRP in a viral video. He spoke of crypto like XRP potentially resisting central control, but he did not go so far as to make a full endorsement. With X Money scheduled to roll out later in 2025, XRP’s architecture for cross-border transfers could mirror what Musk is looking to create. Some analysts point out real hurdles. Ripple still holds a large chunk of XRP, and US regulators are watching closely. Any big move would need legal green lights and deep liquidity on exchanges. But for now, the idea of an “everything app” powered by XRP keeps popping up in crypto chats.

2025-06-07T14:22:16,"XRP ETF Approval Odds Soar Past 92% As Plans For $300M Startegic XRP Reserve Submitted To SEC","Polymarket data shows XRP ETF approval odds have surged above 92%. This boom reveals growing hope that the US SEC will approve an XRP ETF by 2025. Applications filed by major asset managers add pressure on a decision-making process. As institutional interest grows, traders are noticing new presale altcoins. Discover why these events are important for the XRP ecosystem as well as the best substitute for XRP that draws in investors below. Source: fxstreet.com XRP ETF Approval Odds Soars Past 92% The likelihood of a US SEC allowing a spot XRP ETF has increased to 93% over the last month. Data from Polymarket indicates that since early May, approval chances have risen by 20%. Several big asset managers have given things more impetus. Bitwise, applications have been sent in by Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary Capital. Every lawsuit strains the SEC to act swiftly. Source: Kenny Nguyen on X Additionally, the recent XRP futures ETF launches by CME Group and Coinbase Derivatives have been helpful. Mid-May saw both products go live with notable institutional appetite and trading volume. This is evidence, according to analysts, that markets are ready for more controlled XRP products. Legal developments around Ripple also matter. The continuous settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped to reduce ambiguity. Although a definitive agreement is not yet in place, recent court decisions and regulatory signals point to XRP possibly not being considered a security. This legal clarity has changed investor mood and raised approval chances. Now with odds above 92%, insiders see a likely SEC nod for an XRP ETF. Many anticipate a surge in inflows akin to past Bitcoin ETF releases should approval come about. This can inspire greater acceptance and direct fresh capital into XRP investment platforms. Although analysts are still wary about timing, the general agreement is that: The year 2025 looks to be the one for a spot XRP ETF. $300M Strategic XRP Reserve Submitted to SEC Seeking $300 million for an XRP-focused Treasury, Webus International Limited registered a Form 6-K with the SEC. Signing a joint venture with Samara Alpha Management, the Hangzhou-based company established a crypto reserve for payments made using Ripple. For its booking system and chauffeur services, Webus intends to handle quick cross-border payments with XRP. This action conforms to the strategy of renewable energy company VivoPower to create a $121 million XRP reserve and BitGo’s validation of a $100 million initial investment. From the futures market, where Coinbase Derivatives and CME Group debuted XRP futures ETFs in May, institutional curiosity in XRP has extended. Analysts from U.Today point out this trend as a major indicator that large corporations value diversifying outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Remittix: The New XRP Replacing XRP as the Best PayFi System Remittix (RTX) —-a presale crypto on Ethereum–might take front stage as the best PayFi option over XRP. Remittix allows anyone to send crypto and get local money in more than 30 countries without additional charges unlike XRP. Close to $15.5 million has been raised thus far from Remittix’s token presale; analysts estimate a 50x increase when the network opens. Although XRP ETFs show promise, Remittix could be quite helpful for regular payments and company use. Apart from its great use, Remittix has a low entrance point at $0.0781, hence its ROI is higher than XRP. Remittix is also expected to strike exchanges shortly, hence its price is about to soar violently. Final Words Anticipation is at an all-time high as XRP ETF odds exceed 92% and Webus’s $300 million reserve plan formalizes XRP’s part in payments. Still, Remittix is one improvement on XRP ETF products. Remittix provides low fees, PayFi tools, and simple local cash conversion. Remittix might be a better and more useful tool for traders and companies than conventional XRP approaches. Keep an eye on Remittix if you wish to keep ahead since it seeks to surpass XRP ETF in crypto-to- fiat payment systems.

See Why BDAG Is The Best Crypto to Buy Now","What if the biggest opportunity this cycle isn’t in AI or Bitcoin’s speed boosts, but in the way tokens are being sold? While Dawgz AI and Bitcoin Hyper grab attention with new ideas, BlockDAG is shaking up the presale model entirely. Dawgz may have raised $3.5M, and Bitcoin Hyper is priced under $0.012, but BlockDAG is in a league of its own. With over $288.5 million raised, BlockDAG ’s Buyer Battles are creating real buzz. It’s not just another presale, it’s a daily competition. The top buyer wins a chunk of a 150M BDAG token pool, all while locking in the lowest price. That’s why BlockDAG is the best presale crypto to buy right now. Real accumulation, real rewards, and a game-changing format that’s opening doors for all investors. BlockDAG Buyer Battles: Win Big with Every Purchase BlockDAG is turning the presale game on its head with its revolutionary approach, Buyer Battles.

Already, buyers are seeing incredible returns, 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, with Batch 28 now priced at $0.0262.

Specifically, Tim Warren, an analyst on the Investing Broz show, has tipped Cardano to thrive off its new bromance with XRP and Bitcoin. Speaking on the YouTube podcast on June 3, he insisted that ADA could be one of the biggest movers in the altcoin season, potentially becoming a top-five coin.Meanwhile, the commentary follows Cardano’s show of strength, joining a broader market trend. ADA, like most other cryptocurrencies, dropped amid the feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk but has rebounded 7% from its lows of $0.619 on Thursday.Cardano to Explode with Recent PartnershipsCardano and its founder, Charles Hoskinson, have been strategic with their recent activities. The team behind the layer 1 network is not just building; it is forming strategic relationships with other chains.Among them are Bitcoin and Ripple. Hoskinson has turned things around with the XRP community and has recently allied with Ripple, a fintech company and a major contributor to the XRP ecosystem.He has reiterated several times that he is in contact with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and has a good relationship with the company. Notably, Ripple released a video featuring Cardano’s logo in the intro, sparking speculation that something could be in the pipeline.Meanwhile, Cardano has sought ways to unlock trillions of dollars of liquidity from the Bitcoin network. Through strategic partnerships and the recent launches on the Lace wallet, it is finally bridging DeFi functionalities to Bitcoin.Warren insisted that Cardano could leverage not only the liquidity from the impending Reeve upgrade but also from its DeFi venture on the XRP and Bitcoin ecosystems to perform exceptionally in the altcoin season. The partnerships would also boost Cardano’s total value locked (TVL), draw developer traction, and push ADA to a potential top-five coin.Notably, for ADA to break into the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap at its current standing, its market cap would have to grow by an impressive 288%, pushing prices to nearly $2.6.Cardano to $1 in JuneFor context, Warren highlighted that Cardano is one of the few coins still under a buy signal on the weekly chart, presenting a favorable buying opportunity. However, he stressed that bullish momentum, sparked by positive money flows and reversal signals, is emerging on the Cardano chart.Furthermore, he highlighted Cardano’s rebound from the 0.50 Fibonacci level at $0.66, indicating strong bullish momentum. While ADA dropped below the level on Thursday, it has reclaimed the Fibonacci extension, reestablishing confidence that prices could escalate from here. Cardano Chart Analysis Warren Cardano Chart Analysis/Warren With the momentum, Warren expects ADA to take off this June, predicting a reclaim of the $1 price. From its current price of $0.669, the token would need to rally by 49% to reach the target price mark.Interestingly, other analysts also believe Cardano’s new cross-chain partnerships would push prices higher. Ssebi recently predicted $10 for ADA this year, citing Cardano’s partnership with Bitcoin among other factors.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/07/cardano-to-become-a-top-5-coin-amid-relationship-with-bitcoin-and-xrp-top-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-to-become-a-top-5-coin-amid-relationship-with-bitcoin-and-xrp-top-analyst,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

Eric Trump announced that tensions over the memecoin project named after his father have calmed down, and that the family’s controlled World Liberty Financial will purchase a “significant amount” of the memecoin in question. In a post from his X account, Eric Trump stated that the company behind the Trump memecoin will not continue with the digital wallet project that caused the crisis with World Liberty. According to a report in Bloomberg News on Thursday, World Liberty Financial, which is partly owned by the Trump family, sent a “cease-and-desist” letter to the organization Fight Fight Fight, expressing opposition to the digital wallet project called “TRUMP Wallet.” According to the allegations, World Liberty is planning to launch its own digital wallet service.

According to the analytics platform, Bitcoin is facing growing resistance after reaching a new all-time high last month. The resistance can be attributed to exhaustion from profit-taking by long-time Bitcoin holders and exhaustion from buyers who purchased earlier, according to Glassnode. Over the short term, the intensifying profit-taking could point to a distribution phase and not a fresh breakout. “Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.” Glassnode says the market is experiencing the fifth major profit-taking wave in the current cycle, with the realized profits per day having risen to $1.47 billion. “ The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25,000 – $31,000 and $60,000 – $73,000. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.” The continued selling pressure from long-term holders is raising the risk of a short-term correction, according to the analytics platform. The first on-chain support zone for Bitcoin, according to Glassnode, is around $103,700, while the second one is at around the $95,600 price. If the latter is breached, Glassnode says it could be a confirmation of a potential “broader risk reset.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,007 at time of writing.

2025-06-07T13:30:00,"State of Crypto: How Crypto Legislation Is Advancing","The House Financial Services Committee might mark up market structure legislation next week, while the Senate seems close to passing its stablecoin bill. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Legislative moves The narrative Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not. Why it matters The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen. Breaking it down Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely). On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House. ""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for."" In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago). Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then. One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued. The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer — perhaps through the end of the year. This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

2025-06-07T13:24:17,"Ether ETFs Near $1 Billion Milestone After Third Week of Inflows","U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have now marked their third consecutive week of inflows , with recent data pointing to growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed products. According to data from Farside Investors, the funds recorded $25.3 million in inflows on June 6 alone, bringing the current 15-day inflow streak—dating back to May 16—to a total of $837.5 million. This persistent trend represents nearly 25% of the total $3.32 billion in net inflows since spot Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If the momentum continues into the upcoming week, analysts predict the current streak could easily cross the $1 billion threshold. Ether ETFs Outshines Bitcoin as Flows Diverge While Ether ETFs continue their strong run, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a dip in investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF inflows broke their previous streak on May 29, followed by a sharp outflow of $346.8 million. Since then, the flows have been volatile, contrasting Ether’s more consistent capital movement. During this period, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin in price growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged by over 31% in the past month, now trading at $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Some market analysts believe this momentum may be sustained through the current cycle. Technical analyst Crypto Eagles noted that Ether appears to be mimicking historical cycles, particularly the 2020–2021 bull run. If this pattern continues, Ether could be on track to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Analysts Push for Staking Features in ETFs Despite the promising trend, some industry experts argue that Ether ETFs still have room to evolve. One key area of improvement is the inclusion of staking features. Allowing investors to earn rewards from Ether staking directly through ETFs could improve both fund performance and investor appeal. On May 31, ETF provider REX Shares filed to launch the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs in the U.S. Although a launch date is yet to be confirmed, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that REX used “regulatory workarounds” to bring these products closer to market. As institutional interest strengthens and new innovations emerge, Ether ETFs could play a growing role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets.
