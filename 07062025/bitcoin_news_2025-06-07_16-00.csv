2025-06-07T13:42:07,"Major Crisis in Trump Memecoin Comes to an End – Eric Trump Announces Good News","The internal conflict surrounding the Trump family’s cryptocurrency projects has ended. Eric Trump announced that tensions over the memecoin project named after his father have calmed down, and that the family’s controlled World Liberty Financial will purchase a “significant amount” of the memecoin in question. In a post from his X account, Eric Trump stated that the company behind the Trump memecoin will not continue with the digital wallet project that caused the crisis with World Liberty. According to a report in Bloomberg News on Thursday, World Liberty Financial, which is partly owned by the Trump family, sent a “cease-and-desist” letter to the organization Fight Fight Fight, expressing opposition to the digital wallet project called “TRUMP Wallet.” According to the allegations, World Liberty is planning to launch its own digital wallet service. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor's Company Strategy Shares New Bitcoin Purchase Move In the statement that ended the tension, Eric Trump stated that World Liberty would buy a significant amount of the Trump memecoin and add it to its own reserves. Fight Fight Fight, the company that launched the Trump memecoin, is run by longtime President Trump friend and supporter Bill Zanker. Since launching the memecoin in January, the company has generated over $300 million in revenue, according to data analytics firm Chainalysis. Fight Fight Fight and Trump family affiliate CIC Digital LLC hold 80% of the token supply, with a combined value of around $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-07T13:31:39,"$3M NFT Loss Fuels Hunt for 2025’s Best Altcoins to Buy","It’s the same old story. Someone strikes gold in crypto, then loses it all in a flash. This time, it’s a musician who made $3M selling NFTs, only to see the gains disappear thanks to taxes and a market crash. Meanwhile, meme coins keep spiking and crashing like a rollercoaster with no seatbelts. But not everyone wants to gamble with their life savings. Some investors are tired of chasing hype and are now looking for the best altcoins that actually do something useful – or at least have a shot at lasting beyond the next TikTok trend. Let’s talk about three new crypto projects that offer a smarter bet in 2025. These aren’t just meme machines. They’re platforms with purpose, backed by strong presale numbers and real potential. When the Music Stops, so Does the Money Crypto fame can be fleeting – and expensive. Just ask musician Jonathan Mann, who made headlines after selling $3M worth of NFTs through his ‘Song a Day’ project. But when tax season rolled around, Mann owed the IRS more than he could pay. Combined with a brutal crypto crash, it wiped out his earnings. His story has quickly become a cautionary tale – a harsh reminder of what can happen when profits aren’t protected and taxes come calling. For anyone chasing short-term gains in a wildly volatile market, it’s a wake-up call. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – From Meme to Machine: Trading Power at Your Fingertips In a market where fortunes can vanish overnight – Snorter Token ($SNORT) offers something rare: meme-level fun with real utility. Built on Solana, Snorter Token is a fast and secure Telegram-based trading bot that gives retail traders pro-level tools to navigate chaotic token launches. It automates swaps, snipes, stop-losses, and portfolio tracking – all inside Telegram. Trades are routed through custom RPCs for lightning execution and MEV-resistant relayers that flag scams before you touch them. Powered by the $SNORT token, users unlock perks like reduced fees (as low as 0.85%), staking rewards up to 823% APY, and access to premium bot features. The bot already supports Solana, with Ethereum and other chains on the way. Right now, you can buy $SNORT for just $0.0945 and it has already raised over $566K in the presale phase. Unlike joke coins that vanish when the music stops, Snorter’s got a real engine under the hood – and a meme-snorting aardvark leading the charge. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Turning Bitcoin from Slow Store to Superhighway Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver sub-second speeds and near-zero fees. It turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active blockchain for payments, dApps, DeFi, and meme coins. With cross-chain support from day one, Bitcoin Hyper makes fast, cheap, and scalable Bitcoin-based transactions finally possible – without compromise. Right now, $HYPER is priced at $0.0118, with over $670K raised in the presale. Price forecasts put it between $0.15 – $0.32 in 2025. That’s up to 2,610% growth. Add 20% APY staking and the math gets wild. Let’s say you buy 10K $HYPER for $118 today and stake for a year. You’d earn 2K extra tokens, totaling 12K $HYPER. At the current price, that’s $141.60. But at $0.32? That’s $3,840 – from just $118. And this isn’t just hype. Bitcoin Hyper is building on Solana tech, with plans to roll out full support for Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon soon. It’s built for builders, degens, and actual payments – not just HODLers. 3. Fluxbot ($FLUXB) – The Telegram Trading Bot Empowering Retail Investors In the volatile world of crypto, where fortunes can vanish overnight, Fluxbot ($FLUXB) offers a toolset designed to help retail investors navigate the market with greater confidence and efficiency. Fluxbot is a Telegram-based trading bot operating on the Solana blockchain, providing users with lightning-fast token swaps, sniping capabilities, and portfolio management tools. It supports both SPL and Token22 standard tokens, making it versatile for various trading needs. To enhance trading safety, Fluxbot includes a smart AI agent and a built-in RugCheck tool that scans for scams before you trade. At the time of writing, $FLUXB is priced at $0.01078, with a 12.81% gain over the past month – a sign of steady growth in a shaky market. With its user-friendly design and powerful tools, Fluxbot puts pro-level trading into the hands of everyday users. For those looking to trade smarter – not just louder – $FLUXB is a strong contender in 2025. Smarter Bets for a Smarter Cycle Meme coins like $DOGE and $SHIB still generate buzz, but more people are looking beyond the hype and asking: does this project have a real use case, or is it just noise? That’s where Snorter Token , Bitcoin Hyper , and Fluxbot come in – projects that combine meme appeal with real, working tech. From lightning-fast Bitcoin payments to AI-powered Telegram trading bots, they offer tools and utility that go beyond the hype. If you’re tired of gambling on tokens that promise the moon and deliver nothing, these new crypto projects could be your smarter move this year. Remember that crypto is risky.

2025-06-07T13:30:59,"Bitcoin at Crossroads Amid Increased Selling Pressure, Warns Analytics Platform Glassnode – Here’s the Firm’s Outlook","Analytics platform Glassnode is outlining the possible path ahead for Bitcoin ( BTC ) amid a period of intense profit-taking. According to the analytics platform, Bitcoin is facing growing resistance after reaching a new all-time high last month. The resistance can be attributed to exhaustion from profit-taking by long-time Bitcoin holders and exhaustion from buyers who purchased earlier, according to Glassnode. Over the short term, the intensifying profit-taking could point to a distribution phase and not a fresh breakout. “Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.” Glassnode says the market is experiencing the fifth major profit-taking wave in the current cycle, with the realized profits per day having risen to $1.47 billion. “ The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25,000 – $31,000 and $60,000 – $73,000. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.” The continued selling pressure from long-term holders is raising the risk of a short-term correction, according to the analytics platform. The first on-chain support zone for Bitcoin, according to Glassnode, is around $103,700, while the second one is at around the $95,600 price. If the latter is breached, Glassnode says it could be a confirmation of a potential “broader risk reset.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,007 at time of writing.

2025-06-07T13:30:00,"State of Crypto: How Crypto Legislation Is Advancing","The House Financial Services Committee might mark up market structure legislation next week, while the Senate seems close to passing its stablecoin bill. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Legislative moves The narrative Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not. Why it matters The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen. Breaking it down Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely). On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House. ""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for."" In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago). Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then. One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued. The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer — perhaps through the end of the year. This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

2025-06-07T13:24:17,"Ether ETFs Near $1 Billion Milestone After Third Week of Inflows","U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have now marked their third consecutive week of inflows , with recent data pointing to growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed products. According to data from Farside Investors, the funds recorded $25.3 million in inflows on June 6 alone, bringing the current 15-day inflow streak—dating back to May 16—to a total of $837.5 million. This persistent trend represents nearly 25% of the total $3.32 billion in net inflows since spot Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If the momentum continues into the upcoming week, analysts predict the current streak could easily cross the $1 billion threshold. Ether ETFs Outshines Bitcoin as Flows Diverge While Ether ETFs continue their strong run, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a dip in investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF inflows broke their previous streak on May 29, followed by a sharp outflow of $346.8 million. Since then, the flows have been volatile, contrasting Ether’s more consistent capital movement. During this period, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin in price growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged by over 31% in the past month, now trading at $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Some market analysts believe this momentum may be sustained through the current cycle. Technical analyst Crypto Eagles noted that Ether appears to be mimicking historical cycles, particularly the 2020–2021 bull run. If this pattern continues, Ether could be on track to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Analysts Push for Staking Features in ETFs Despite the promising trend, some industry experts argue that Ether ETFs still have room to evolve. One key area of improvement is the inclusion of staking features. Allowing investors to earn rewards from Ether staking directly through ETFs could improve both fund performance and investor appeal. On May 31, ETF provider REX Shares filed to launch the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs in the U.S. Although a launch date is yet to be confirmed, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that REX used “regulatory workarounds” to bring these products closer to market. As institutional interest strengthens and new innovations emerge, Ether ETFs could play a growing role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets.

2025-06-07T13:18:05,"Pepe croaks as whale exodus deepens and buyers flinch","Pepe coin price retreated this week as whales continued selling and the crypto market sell-off intensified. Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-biggest meme coin on Ethereum ( ETH ), plunged to a low of $0.00001043, down by 36% from its highest point in May. This decline happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most meme coins plunged because of profit-taking and geopolitical issues. Pepe’s crash also happened as whales continued exiting their positions, signaling that they expected the downtrend to continue. The supply held by whales has dropped to 137.4 trillion, down from the year-to-date high of 166 trillion. Their holdings have fallen to the lowest point since November last year. The Network Realized Profit/Loss metric has plunged into the negative zone, a sign that some sellers are exiting at a loss. More on-chain data shows that active addresses have slumped to less than 3,000. Pepe on-chain metrics | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, Pepe has become cheap, which may push investors to buy the dip. The closely-watched MVRV ratio with the Z score has dropped to minus 0.192. You might also like: Hyperliquid coin forms bullish pennant as momentum builds: is a breakout imminent? A negative MVRV ratio means that a coin’s market value has moved below the average price at which holders acquired their coins. It often signals that a coin is in a buy zone. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe token price has decreased from last month’s high of $0.00001622 to $0.000011 today. It is consolidating at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Pepe’s price has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.00001622 and the lower side at $0.0000052. The recent dip is likely part of the formation of the handle section of the C&H pattern. Therefore, if this pattern works out, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the all-time high of $0.00002712, about 135% above the current level. This view will be confirmed if it rises above the cup’s upper side at $0.00001622.

2025-06-07T13:01:00,"From seizure to sale: Beijing taps Hong Kong to liquidate crypto","In a move that underscores the strategic value of Hong Kong’s regulatory autonomy, Beijing has established its first formal process for liquidating confiscated cryptocurrencies—tapping into Hong Kong’s licensed exchanges to offload digital assets seized in criminal cases. The arrangement highlights the stark policy divide between mainland China’s hardline anti-crypto stance and Hong Kong’s ambitions as a digital asset hub. It also offers a practical solution for Chinese authorities to convert seized crypto into fiat currency without breaching domestic restrictions. According to a local report from Tech In Asia , Beijing’s Public Security Bureau established a disposal framework that involves collaboration with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to coordinate the sale of virtual assets seized in criminal cases. Third-party agencies will carry out transactions on licensed platforms, and proceeds will be converted to yuan and transferred to designated government accounts. This marks the first formal process established by mainland Chinese authorities for disposing of seized crypto. You might also like: Lightchain AI gains trader favor as Polygon fails to turn tech hype into real demand China’s crypto catch finds a Hong Kong exit The decision to use Hong Kong’s regulated cryptocurrency infrastructure shows a major, stark regulatory divide between mainland China and the Special Administrative Region. While Beijing maintains one of the world’s most restrictive cryptocurrency policies, Hong Kong has actively cultivated its position as a regional digital asset hub. Hong Kong’s regulatory framework allows licensed exchanges to serve institutional and qualified retail investors. This creates an ideal conduit for Chinese authorities seeking to liquidate seized assets and also maintain compliance with mainland restrictions. The arrangement shows Hong Kong’s strategic value as a bridge between China’s strict domestic policies and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Licensed exchanges in the territory can process large-scale transactions and also ensures regulatory compliance and proper documentation.

Official estimates suggest authorities control approximately 194,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 833,000 Ethereum ( ETH ). Previously, Chinese authorities lacked established mechanisms for converting seized cryptocurrencies into traditional currency. The timing coincides with global trends in government cryptocurrency holdings, as law enforcement agencies worldwide are puzzled on how to manage the substantial digital asset seizures. The United States government currently holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion, while the United Kingdom possesses over 61,000 Bitcoin from fraud investigations. Beijing’s decision to utilize Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency infrastructure shows the practical flexibility within China’s “One Country, Two Systems” framework. The arrangement allows mainland authorities to access regulated cryptocurrency markets without compromising domestic policy positions. Chinese authorities maintain that the liquidation process aligns with existing anti-cryptocurrency policies by removing seized digital assets from circulation rather than facilitating new trading activities. The framework establishes clear procedures for converting volatile digital assets into stable fiat currency and reduces storage risks and administrative burdens associated with long-term cryptocurrency custody.

2025-06-07T13:00:53,"Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback – Bulls Eye $3,000 Level","Ethereum has faced a sharp pullback, dropping over 10% in the last 24 hours as global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty shake investor confidence across markets. The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins—including Ethereum—are under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH’s ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range. The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play. Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets. ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range. Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 — a psychological and technical milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The chart shows that ETH’s recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 — a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market.

As long as ETH holds above the $2,400–$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid. A daily close below $2,400, however, could expose the asset to a deeper correction toward the $2,200 zone, where the 100-day EMA provides additional technical support.

According to reports, the minister also had a meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams. According to reports inside Pakistan, the minister held discussions concerning blockchain with United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a key architect of the US crypto regulation. Senators Bill Hagerty, Rick Scott, Tim Sheehy, and Jim Justice were also present at the meeting in Washington, DC. According to the press release made available on Friday, Saqib also engaged in several discussions with members of the Financial Services Committee at the White House. Pakistan’s crypto minister discusses blockchain regulation with US officials During the discussions, he mentioned the country’s intention to be a global leader when it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain . “From Capitol Hill to the White House, I shared a new face of Pakistan: one driven by youth, innovation, and global partnerships,” he said. He also discussed the recent initiatives undertaken by the country with the US officials, including Pakistan’s plans to establish its strategic Bitcoin reserve. In addition, Saqib also talked about the steps that Pakistan has taken towards the establishment of its virtual asset regulatory framework and the adoption of stablecoins to streamline the country’s remittances. According to the press release, the country sees more than $36 billion in annual remittances, owing to its booming freelance sector. Meanwhile, in a separate meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Saqib discussed the challenges and approaches to the growing digital asset industry in the country. He mentioned that the sector opens up a high-potential market, but the country needs to be careful about how it decides to approach it in terms of regulation, so it can help it and not stifle its growth. During the meeting, which took place at Mayor Adam’s residence, Saqib noted that the Pakistan Crypto Council is willing to work with New York City to aid regulation and innovation. Crypto collaboration on the horizon in the country New York and Pakistan have both launched their respective crypto councils, as they aim to ensure responsible growth of their digital asset sector. The meeting marked a step towards direct collaboration between the two councils, with plans to develop knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and policy advisory initiatives. The visit to Gracie Mansion concluded his official US tour, which focused on blockchain innovation, public-private partnerships, and international crypto cooperation. Over the past few months, the country has set up several initiatives as it aims to regulate the crypto industry. After setting up the PCC, it set up the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp­liant and responsible adoption of digital assets. The PCC meeting held earlier this month touched on various subjects, including a draft framework to regulate the sector. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb, who also serves as the chairman of the PCC. He discussed the formation of a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, law, and IT & telecom divisions to review draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure for digital assets. The PCC also convened a meeting last week to discuss confusion surrounding its crypto policy. The development came after internal arguments over the legality of holding digital assets in the country, a stance that the State Bank of Pakistan has clarified.

2025-06-07T12:25:56,"Expert Predicts What 2,000 XRP Will Be Worth by the End of 2025","A recent analysis from crypto commentator Steph presents two potential valuation scenarios for XRP by the close of the 2025 bull market. Drawing from market dominance trends and technical chart patterns, Steph explores how much 2,000 XRP could be worth if it reclaims its former market position. Market Dominance and Historical Performance XRP once held a significant portion of the overall cryptocurrency market, reaching a peak dominance of about 30% during previous bullish cycles. However, its share has diminished in recent years, sitting at approximately 4% at the time of Steph’s report. In contrast, Bitcoin currently accounts for 62% of the market share, with Ethereum holding around 10%. Steph believes XRP has broken free from a downtrend that began in 2017. This shift, he argues, could mark the beginning of a recovery in XRP’s dominance and price. To evaluate XRP’s potential, he outlines two scenarios based on different assumptions about total crypto market capitalization and XRP’s possible share of it. WHAT 2,000 #XRP COINS WILL BE WORTH IN 2025 (Crazy Rich!) pic.twitter.com/odEckX57XM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 25, 2025 Scenario 1: Flat Market Cap, Strong XRP Growth In this conservative case, the overall cryptocurrency market cap remains unchanged at $3.48 trillion. If XRP regains a 30% market share under these conditions, its price would increase substantially. According to Steph’s calculations, XRP could reach $17.10 per token. At that price, a portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens would be valued at $34,200. Based on a current investment of around $4,650, this would represent a return exceeding 600%. However, the analysis acknowledges that this outcome depends heavily on XRP outperforming the broader market, which may not be likely in a flat-growth environment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Scenario 2: Market Expansion and Higher Valuation The second scenario envisions a more optimistic market trajectory, with total capitalization doubling to $6.96 trillion. Should XRP attain 30% market dominance under these conditions, Steph estimates the token’s value would climb to $34.20. This would bring the total value of 2,000 XRP tokens to $68,400, yielding a return of over 1,370% from current price levels. Steph argues this outcome is within reach, supported by increasing institutional involvement. Some financial entities have reportedly shown interest in holding XRP as part of their treasury assets, while others are exploring the launch of exchange-traded products tied to the cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Momentum Steph also highlights a technical setup on XRP’s monthly chart, specifically a double bottom formation with a confirmed breakout above resistance. This pattern, he notes, suggests a bullish continuation and aligns with the price targets discussed in both scenarios. Based on this chart structure alone, XRP could approach $30 in value, consistent with Scenario 2’s projection. While Steph’s projections present compelling upside potential, he cautions that market dominance levels are inherently unpredictable. Even if XRP reaches only 15–20% market share, the gains could still be substantial. However, investors are advised to exercise due diligence and remain realistic about market volatility and competitive dynamics.

2025-06-07T12:20:51,"Bitcoin Advocates Urge Elon Musk to Go All-In Amid Feud With Trump","As tensions escalate between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the U.S. President Donald Trump, prominent voices from the Bitcoin community are urging Musk to respond by embracing BTC more aggressively. According to analysts and industry leaders, adopting a full-fledged Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful financial and political move for Musk. “Full porting Bitcoin is the best way for Elon to get back at Trump,” wrote crypto analyst Will Clemente in a June 6 post on X. Echoing that view, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow made a direct appeal to Musk: “@elonmusk, it’s time to go all in on Bitcoin.” The comments come amid a series of public barbs traded between Musk and Trump on social media over taxes, tariffs, and government subsidies. Calls for Tesla to Resume Bitcoin Payments Mow further urged Musk to resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases—a move the company paused in 2021 due to environmental concerns. He also called on Tesla to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy to diversify its holdings away from fiat currencies. Despite discontinuing Bitcoin payments, Tesla still holds significant digital assets , which declined in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1 2024. Mow proposed that Musk extend BTC payment options to SpaceX customers by offering launch discounts for BTC payments. “Force a hard money standard on the money printers,” Mow added, in a pointed comment directed at fiat-based financial systems and central banks. The push follows growing criticism that the U.S. government has failed to act on its so-called Strategic BTC Reserve, which was reportedly signed into executive order form by Trump months ago but hasn’t yet materialized into any purchases. Musk’s Potential Influence on Bitcoin Global Narrative Some believe that if Musk does commit fully to Bitcoin, the impact would be global and transformational. Lomob CEO Boyd Cohen noted, “If Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off. He doesn’t do anything small.” Cohen predicted Musk could rapidly build the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury and influence global adoption through his companies. The feud intensified after Musk criticized Trump’s tax plan and warned that his proposed global tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession. Trump fired back by suggesting that eliminating Musk’s government subsidies could save taxpayers billions. While Musk has a history of engaging with crypto, most recently discussing BTC-style encryption for X’s messaging feature, many are watching closely to see whether he will translate his crypto commentary into action.

2025-06-07T12:05:07,"Stunning Statements from MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor – “The Price of Bitcoin in 2045…”","Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), one of the most prominent advocates of Bitcoin, announced both the company's new capital raising plans and his expectations for the future of Bitcoin on the Squawk Box program he attended on CNBC. Saylor said the company aims to raise approximately $1 billion through a 10% fixed-income preferred stock offering. The majority of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, particularly for the purchase of more Bitcoin. Saylor, who stated that they have made three different preferred stock offerings in the last six months, said that these vehicles offer high fixed returns to investors, and at the same time, the company increases shareholder value by directing these funds to Bitcoin investments. According to Saylor, this model offers “indefinite” fixed-income investments with no debt maturity and no refinancing risk. “By pairing a long-term liability with a long-term asset, we are essentially creating an indestructible balance sheet,” Saylor said, outlining the company’s strategy. He argued that this model offers both an attractive 10% yield for fixed income investors and indirectly gives equity investors access to more Bitcoin. Touching on the regulatory front, Saylor stated that the recent recognition of Bitcoin as a “digital commodity” by the US administration, the positive changes made in accounting standards, and the green light given to Bitcoin by banks show the improvement in the sector. Related News: Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details One of the most striking statements on the program was Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin forecast. Referring to a speech he gave in July 2024, Saylor argued that Bitcoin could provide an average annual compound return of 30% for the next 20 years. According to this scenario, Bitcoin could reach $13 million in 2045. Citing past performance as an example, Saylor said Bitcoin has gained 57% annually over the past four and a half years, four times the S&P 500 and eight times the real estate and bond returns. “Bitcoin is crushing everything,” he said. His statements at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference also came to the fore. Saylor reiterated that he was against Strategy’s “proof-of-reserves” application for the 567,000 Bitcoins it holds. Stating that this poses a security risk, Saylor stated that he maintained this view despite the criticisms of some Bitcoin advocates who called for transparency. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-07T12:04:31,"Investors Remain Cautiously Optimistic as Market Sees Volatility Toward The Weekend: Report","Over the last 48 hours, millions of dollars have been liquidated in the cryptocurrency market due to tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their public dispute has caused markets to end the week on a bearish note. However, a weekly report from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance indicates that investors are cautiously optimistic, with growing confidence in a soft landing and a slowly cooling economy. Still, they remain sensitive to inflation risks and signals from the Federal Reserve. Trump-Musk Feud Shakes Markets Bitcoin (BTC), which has mostly consolidated between $104,000 and $106,000 since the beginning of the week, fell below $101,000, tumbling to a multi-week low amid the Trump-Musk feud . Ether (ETH) also took a hit, briefly falling below $2,400. Besides the struggling prices of BTC and ETH, their balances on crypto exchanges recorded significant drops in the first few days of the month. Since the start of May, the metric tracking the two biggest digital assets has plummeted 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. This plunge in supply has marked new yearly lows for the balances of BTC and ETH held on exchanges. Binance believes this could be a sign of accumulation because investors are moving their assets off trading platforms. Moreover, bitcoin’s correlation with equities and gold has continued to hold. The two-month BTC–S&P 500 correlation rose to 0.49 from last week, while the cryptocurrency’s correlation with gold climbed to 0.09. ETFs Gain Institutional Traction On the brighter side, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining institutional traction, which can be attributed to some recent regulatory reforms. Towards the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance stating that staking activities on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks do not constitute securities transfers. From then on, crypto ETF providers could incorporate staking rewards into their offerings. Building on the same momentum, the multinational finance giant JPMorgan announced two days ago that it would allow clients to use crypto ETF shares as collateral for loans. Notably, Circle, the stablecoin issuer behind the USD Coin (USDC), launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm raised $1.5 billion for the IPO by selling 34 million shares at $31 each. However, the 220 million outstanding shares disclosed in its June 2 filing with the SEC said the valuation stood at $6.9 billion. At the time of writing, the firm had a market capitalization of at least $20 billion, following the skyrocketing of its shares on the NYSE after the listing.

With its oracles powering smart contracts and deep integrations across DeFi, LINK has earned its reputation. But recent long-term projections—like a modest $29.83 price in 2040—have some investors wondering if they’re aiming too low. And that’s why a growing number of Chainlink price analysts are shifting their gaze toward a new contender: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Why? Because it doesn’t just forecast growth—it unlocks wealth creation today. And it does it from the one tool every investor already owns: their phone. LINK Has Utility—But BTC-S Has Income Chainlink’s ecosystem is thriving. It secures billions in DeFi, anchors hybrid contracts, and powers financial data pipelines. But it’s primarily a backend service layer, not a direct income generator for everyday users. Bitcoin Solaris flips that model. It’s built not just for developers, but for anyone who wants to earn. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine, manage, and grow BTC-S directly from mobile devices and laptops—no expensive equipment, no technical skill, no waiting. And that’s a game-changer. The Solaris Nova App Is Making Crypto Passive Again At the center of the BTC-S movement is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, a beautifully designed mining suite that transforms the most common devices—phones, laptops, and browsers—into daily earning tools. What it delivers: Tap-to-mine setup optimized for non-technical users Seamless operation across Android, iOS, Windows, and browser platforms Built-in wallet with biometric login and encrypted keys Real-time mining stats and earnings tracking Performance-based gamification and leaderboard features Smart device-aware energy usage controls This isn’t just accessibility—it’s wealth-building in disguise. Users can begin mining without capital barriers, echoing the energy of 2010 Bitcoin miners… except now, it fits in your pocket. Deep Architecture Powering the Simplicity BTC-S isn’t only about usability. Behind the tap-to-earn interface is one of the most powerful blockchain designs in the market: a hybrid dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW, with 5-minute block times, anchored on accumulated hash power Solaris Layer: DPoS with 21 active validators, rotating every 24 hours Smart contract throughput of up to 100,000 TPS Block size scaling up to 32MB Smart contracts written in Rust, following the Solana development model Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy and compliance This dual-consensus structure allows BTC-S to combine decentralized security with lightning-fast execution, making it a true powerhouse for both developers and earners. Turn Your Device Into a Mining Machine Real Rewards: Distribution That Favors Participation Unlike tokens, where gains depend solely on market movements, BTC-S includes direct block-level rewards: 40% of mining rewards go to Base Layer PoW miners 25% to Solaris Layer validators 20% to stakers Bonus weighting based on device specs, uptime, and contribution value This creates a powerful flywheel: users mine, get rewarded, and reinvest—all within the same decentralized ecosystem. Influencers Are Paying Attention Crypto analysts and influencers have begun echoing what early adopters already know: BTC-S isn’t hype—it’s built. Crypto Legends : Broke down how BTC-S “feels like early Bitcoin all over again—except this time, it’s mobile.” Crypto Royal : Highlighted the layered architecture and validator fairness model. Token Empire : Called the upcoming app “a gateway to passive crypto ownership for the average user.” Token Galaxy : Focused on how the dynamic reward system encourages long-term engagement. This kind of influencer alignment rarely happens during presale phases, but it’s happening now. Presale Fueling the Engine Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just being praised—it’s being purchased. Over 11,000 unique users have already joined, and with over $3 million raised , the momentum is undeniable. What’s more, it’s happening under a strict 90-day schedule, making it one of the shortest presales in recent memory. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Ends: July 31, 2025 Return Potential: 1,900% Only ~8 weeks remain There’s no fluff—just utility, daily engagement, and rising demand. Security, Community, and Compliance BTC-S understands that in 2025, credibility matters. That’s why it’s already passed a rigorous audit by Cyberscope , and its team is fully KYC-verified . It also maintains strong, responsive presence across Telegram and X , where updates, AMAs, and presale stats are shared live. Transparency isn’t a feature—it’s standard operating procedure. Conclusion: From Chainlink Predictions to Bitcoin Solaris Reality Chainlink will always have a place in Web3 infrastructure. But at 5% projected annual growth, it’s not a path to overnight wealth. BTC-S, on the other hand, is engineering accessibility, income, and growth directly into its architecture, then placing that power in the hands of users. This isn’t a model built for institutions—it’s built for you. And if you missed mining Bitcoin in 2010, this time, you’re holding the rig in your hand.

Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson pointed out , “ Now that we are on the other side of the tempest in the teacup, the ecosystem can move on to higher ground with greener pastures. We have left behind slander brigades, disgruntled exes, and toxic energy vampires for Bitcoin DeFi, governance finally taking shape, Midnight, and massive advances like Leios and Midgard.” Therefore, Hoskinson is optimistic that Cardano will enter the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in full swing because it will act as a stepping stone towards driving innovation and unlocking new financial opportunities in the crypto space. This move could position Cardano as a leading platform for DeFi by utilizing its smart contract capabilities and Bitcoin’s liquidity. Hoskinson also recently unveiled Cardano’s ambitious vision , where artificial intelligence and privacy-focused sidechain Midnight will take center stage.

Analyst Brian Meredith still has a buy rating on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Class B shares, but has cut the price target from $606 per share to $591, reports CNBC. In an investment note, Meredith says the decline in the share price target is due to the expectation of less investment income as well as no stock buybacks this year and in 2026. “We continue to believe BRK’s shares are attractive in an uncertain macro environment with $347 billion of cash and [short-term] investments, a defensive business mix, and manageable tariff exposure.” Data shows Berkshire’s billionaire CEO Warren Buffett has parked $305.5 billion into the safe-haven asset class, short-dated Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. At the same time, the firm has been slashing stakes in banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America, and Capital One. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

2025-06-07T11:39:24,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Trump Urges Fed to Cut Interest Rates in Favor of Crypto","Bitcoin made a new all-time high on May 22 when it crossed $112K. Although it dipped below $100K soon after, it’s now showing signs of recovery and a potential run upwards. Carlo Pruscino from CMC Markets believes that a Fed rate cut might drive $BTC back to $112K and potentially even beyond. Keep reading to find out Trump’s stance on a potential Fed rate cut, when we can expect one, and what the best altcoins to buy are to make the most of this pro-crypto situation. Trump Wants a Rate Cut Now Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the Fed on delayed rate cuts . He said that Europe has already had 10 rate cuts while the US is lagging behind. He also pointed out there’s no inflation anymore – in case that’s what is holding back the Fed. He said that if inflation were to come back, the Fed could simply raise the interest rate again. As of now, though, Trump believes that the US is paying a lot more in borrowing costs than it should. It’s worth noting that the Federal Reserve has been mulling over rate cuts for quite some time. However, Trump’s ongoing trade tariff war and uncertain trade policies have held it from making a decisive move. The current borrowing rate is 4.25%–4.50%. As per CME Group’s data , 97.5% of market participants believe that this will remain unchanged in the upcoming Fed meeting on June 18. More than 51% of people believe that a rate cut might come around mid-September, where rates may be slashed by 25 basis points. If we see a rate cut earlier than expected, $BTC may be the first major asset to react. When…further rate cuts come, if they’re coming a lot sooner than expected, that will then impact heavily on the future price moves or crypto on Bitcoin and some other cryptos as well. – Carlo Pruscino, a CMC Markets analyst To help you make the most out of upcoming policy changes, we’ve handpicked the best cryptos to invest in . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now, Free $BTC Airdrops Bitcoin will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rising crypto market. In fact, the ‘digital gold’ is what will pull the crypto market to new highs in the first place. As such, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin, is the best crypto to buy if you’re bullish on $BTC and want to maximize your returns. Unlike other altcoins, $BTCBULL token holders will be rewarded with free $BTC. This will happen on two occasions: once when Bitcoin reaches $150K and another when it reaches $200K for the first time. Just make sure to store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events, which will take place on social media. In addition to having a genuine shot at grabbing real $BTC, you’ll also benefit from a monstrous rise in $BTCBULL’s price. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , the token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 – a 276% rise from current prices. Buy $BTCBULL now for just $0.00255 each. The project is in presale, where it has amassed nearly $7M. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer-2, Insane $45M Presale Raise A rise in Bitcoin will likely lead to joyous times in the meme coin market as well, which is why we believe that Solaxy ($SOLX) could be one of the next cryptos to explode . Designed to strengthen the best blockchain for meme coins, $SOLX is being hyped as Solana’s prodigal son, and for good reason. After all, Solaxy will finally cure Solana of its congestion and scalability issues, which it has been facing ever since the success of $TRUMP and other viral meme coins overloaded it. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which will offload transactions from the mainnet onto a sidechain. This will reduce the workload on Solana, thereby restoring its lightning-fast executions. Furthermore, this brand-new L2 will also process transactions in bulk, which will decrease the overall cost requirements on Solana. To participate in Solaxy’s one-of-a-kind mission and token growth – it’s predicted to rise by over 11,300% by 2030 – become an early investor in the project. It’s currently in presale, with over $45M raised, and you can get each token for just $0.001748. Here’s how to buy it . 3. PepeCoin ($PEP) – Pepe-Inspired Meme Coin Currently Among the Top Gainers Although you wouldn’t be wrong to think that PepeCoin ($PEP) borrows its popularity from the legendary $PEPE meme coin, it’s got a handful of unique features that have had a fair bit of say in it being one of the top trending cryptos . For instance, PepeCoin runs on its own blockchain, which is how it offers astonishingly low transaction fees and zero $ETH gas fees. Coming to its performance, $PEP is up over 3,000% since its inception in June 2024 . More recently, the token has recorded 28% gains over the past thirty days. According to price action analysis, $PEP is closing in on a major resistance level ($0.00024), a break of which could see the token soar to $0.00027 and beyond. The Best Altcoins to Benefit from a Rate Cut, but They’re Not Completely Dependent on It With a rate cut on the horizon, major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum could finally start rallying – and the altcoin space will only get more bullish. While new cryptos, like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Solaxy ($SOLX) , will indeed benefit from increased public borrowing and investment, their solid fundamentals and community hype will likely see them rising regardless. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing.

2025-06-07T11:30:00,"The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62%","One of the reasons that the altcoin season seemed to not have begun until now is the fact that Bitcoin has dominated the market recovery, and thus, the BTC dominance remains very high. For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run. Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62% The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%. This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result. For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, “real momentum kicks in under 62%,” and this is when altcoin season moves with full force. Altcoin Season Is Not Over The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Averages $2 Billion In June As Price Struggles Below $0.2 One analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has lent their voice, pushing the narrative that the altcoin season is far from over. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.

2025-06-07T11:00:33,"Significant Tether Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Market Watch","BitcoinWorld Significant Tether Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Market Watch Keeping an eye on large cryptocurrency movements is crucial for understanding market dynamics. Recently, a significant Bitcoin transfer from a major player caught the attention of on-chain analysts. This movement involves a Tether -associated wallet and the prominent exchange, Binance . What is the Significance of this Tether BTC Transfer to Binance? According to data shared by the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a wallet identified as a Tether lending collateral custody wallet initiated a notable transaction. Eight hours ago, this wallet transferred 200 BTC , valued at approximately $20.88 million at the time of the transfer, to Binance . While a single transfer of this size is noteworthy, the cumulative activity from this specific crypto wallet adds further context. Lookonchain’s report highlights that since May 9th, this same wallet has moved a total of 1,650 BTC to the Binance exchange. This larger sum represents a significant value of around $174.7 million based on the approximate prices at the times of transfer. Such large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges from institutional-linked wallets are often monitored closely by traders and analysts looking for potential market signals. Why Track Bitcoin Wallet Activity? Tracking movements on the Bitcoin blockchain provides transparency into where large amounts of capital are flowing. Big transfers from wallets associated with entities like custodians, whales, or institutions to exchanges can sometimes indicate an intent to sell, increase liquidity on the exchange, or engage in other trading activities. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges can suggest accumulation or movement to cold storage. Understanding the typical behavior of specific addresses, like a Tether custody wallet, helps analysts interpret the potential implications of their actions. While not every transfer to an exchange leads to immediate selling, a pattern of significant inflows can contribute to increased selling pressure on the order books. Understanding the Role of a Crypto Wallet in These Movements A crypto wallet is essential for holding and transacting with digital assets like BTC . In this case, the wallet is described as a “Tether lending collateral custody wallet.” This suggests it holds Bitcoin that is likely used as collateral for lending operations involving Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. Movements from such a wallet to an exchange like Binance could be related to: Rebalancing collateral positions. Preparing assets for over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Making BTC available for distribution or sale. Internal management or consolidation of funds. Without explicit information from Tether, the exact reason for the transfers remains speculative. However, the fact that these funds are moving from a custody wallet, which typically holds assets long-term or as collateral, to a liquid exchange platform is what makes the event notable. What Does This Transfer Mean for the Market? A large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange like Binance is generally seen as a potentially bearish signal by some market participants, as it increases the supply of BTC available for trading and potentially selling. However, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point or even a series of transfers without considering the broader market context. Key insights from this event include: Visibility: On-chain analysis provides transparency into significant fund movements. Potential Liquidity Increase: The transfers add substantial BTC liquidity to Binance . Interpretation Challenge: The specific intent behind the transfers by Tether is not publicly disclosed, making definitive conclusions difficult. Market participants should view this data point as one piece of the puzzle. While a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange can signal potential selling pressure, it doesn’t guarantee a price drop. Other factors, such as overall market sentiment, demand, macroeconomic news, and other on-chain metrics, also play significant roles. Summary The recent movement of 200 BTC , following cumulative transfers of 1,650 BTC since May 9th, from a Tether custody wallet to Binance represents a significant flow of value onto a major exchange. While the exact reason for these transfers is unknown, they highlight the importance of monitoring large crypto wallet movements and exchange inflows as potential indicators of shifting market dynamics. This specific Bitcoin transfer activity from a wallet associated with lending collateral warrants attention from those tracking institutional or large-scale participant behavior in the crypto space.

A total of 9,238 employees of the government of South Dakota received double payments last month after a glitch at First Premier Bank, the financial institution contracted to perform payroll processing for the state, reports the CBS-affiliated news station KELO. South Dakota’s State Auditor Rich Sattgast says more than 10,000 erroneous deposits have been made. “[The glitch] affected 9,238 employees, which affected 12,136 deposits as many employees have their pay going to more than one bank account.” The payroll hitch reportedly happened when one of First Premier Bank’s vendors was running tests on the payment services software. Keloland cites South Dakota’s state treasurer, saying, “A vendor who processes ACH [Automated Clearing House] transactions for First PREMIER Bank performed a backup and recovery test, which resulted in a duplicate file posting. This impacted many banks across the country.” Efforts to reverse the erroneous transactions that resulted in the duplicate salaries started soon after the errors were discovered.

The plea is coming after their amicus briefs, filed earlier this week on behalf of the platform, were rejected by a federal judge. According to the crypto advocacy groups, along with other organizations, they want the dismissal of the charges against the Bitcoin mixer, which was charged with operating as an illegal money transmitter. In the briefs filed on behalf of the platform, the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, and the DeFi Education Fund argued that Samourai only helped people carry out their financial transactions online without violating any laws in the United States. Samourai wallet acted as a Bitcoin mixing service, allowing people to mask previous crypto transactions that the feds shut down in April 2024. Police arrested its developers, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill. The United States Department of Justice mentioned that the app was acting as an unlicensed money-transmitting business used by criminals. 1/ Today @BlockchainAssn , along with @fund_defi , are sharing an amicus brief supporting the motion to dismiss Count II in the Samourai Wallet case. The government's novel legal theory threatens to criminalize software developers who build tools that help people control their own… pic.twitter.com/QFZadJrXv4 — Marisa Tashman Coppel (@MTCoppel) June 6, 2025 Crypto advocacy groups want charges against Samourai Wallet dismissed The DeFi Education Fund, alongside the Blockchain Association, argued that the illegal money-transmitting count was invalid because prosecuting software developers who do not have access to user funds is outside the meaning of the statute. This means that the arrested parties only wrote the software, which has since been used by others to transfer user funds, and never dealt with the money themselves. The crypto advocacy groups also mentioned that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has also determined that entities need total independent control to be classified as money transmitters. “[The government’s] interpretation of the money-transmitting laws to cover non-custodial software tools generated widespread shock and alarm in the cryptocurrency world, which had long relied on the government’s clear and correct guidance saying the opposite,” the brief submitted by the Blockchain Association and the DeFi Education Fund read. Speaking on the issue, the chief legal officer and executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, Amanda Tuminelli, said that it is normal for people to want privacy. “Privacy is normal: it’s normal for people to want to be able to make financial transactions on-chain whilst still maintaining privacy—people do that with cash every day in their regular lives,” Tuminelli said. Samourai Wallet developers urge the court to vacate their charges Coin Center’s executive director Peter Van Valkenburgh also said that the defendants operating a coinjoin server does not mean they controlled user funds and justified being treated as a money transmitter under the FinCEN guideline in 2019. Meanwhile, Lawyers representing the defendants, Rodriguez and Lonergan Hill, submitted paperwork last week, calling for the dismissal of the case. The paperwork mentioned that the users of the app were always in control of their Bitcoin. Crypto mixing applications have made headlines in the United States since 2022, following a ban on Ethereum-based Tornado Cash . Authorities mentioned that the platform had become the go-to place for criminals trying to launder their ill-gotten funds. The feds alleged that the application’s co-founder Roman Storm and his partner Roman Semenov, laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Politicians have also been speaking about the case, with one of the most popular crypto exchanges in America, Coinbase, funding a lawsuit to argue against the sanction of Tornado Cash. The United States Treasury mentioned in March that it had removed Tornado Cash from the list of platforms sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In April, a federal court permanently barred the agency from reimposing sanctions on the platform.

According to a financial disclosure filed on June 5, Collins reported five digital asset transactions, each valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Notably, one was a Sui ( SUI ) purchase on June 3, just two days before the filing. However, the most curious trade involved the meme coin Ski Mask Dog (SKI). Collins bought SKI on May 5 and sold it three days later, on May 8, within the same value range. But rather than walk away, he doubled down, buying more SKI on May 9 and May 12. None of these trades were disclosed until June. This transaction emerged when SKI faced increased volatility, gaining by about 1.3% in the past month, trading at $0.05623 as of press time. SKI one-month price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Mike Collins’ other transactions In addition to meme coins, Collins invested in The Graph (GRT), a more established crypto asset, purchasing between $1,001 and $15,000 on May 9. While there’s no direct evidence of misconduct, the timing and nature of Collins’ trades remain questionable. Most lawmakers who report crypto activity tend to stick to mainstream assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ( ETH ). In contrast, Collins has shown a consistent appetite for meme coins, which are known to be more volatile with no solid underlying fundamentals. Notably, this isn’t his first brush with controversy around meme coins for the lawmaker. In December, he disclosed three crypto trades made on December 1 and 2, including two SKI purchases valued between $1,001 and $15,000 each. At the same time, Collins’ past trades have had varied outcomes. In July 2024, Finbold reported that his $50,000 investment in Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ) netted a $38,000 profit in just two weeks. However, he also faced notable losses from his Velodrome Finance (VELO) position.

2025-06-07T10:50:28,"Crucial Shift: Crypto Fear and Greed Index Enters Neutral Zone","BitcoinWorld Crucial Shift: Crypto Fear and Greed Index Enters Neutral Zone Are you watching the crypto market closely? A significant indicator, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , has just moved into a new phase, suggesting a shift in the prevailing crypto market sentiment . For investors and traders navigating the digital asset landscape, understanding this index is key to interpreting potential market movements. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, provided by software development platform Alternative, is a popular tool used to gauge the general sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It aims to quantify the emotional state of market participants, which often drives price action. The index operates on a simple principle: extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity (as prices may be artificially low due to panic selling), while extreme greed can suggest the market is due for a correction (as prices may be inflated by FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out). The index is presented as a single number ranging from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-50: Neutral 51-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed The Recent Shift: From Fear to Neutral Territory As of June 7, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index registered a value of 52. This marks a notable increase of seven points from the previous day. More importantly, this movement signifies a transition out of the ‘Fear’ zone and into the ‘Neutral’ zone. For a period, the market had been characterized by higher levels of fear, often associated with price downturns or uncertainty. The move to 52 suggests that while outright ‘Greed’ is not yet dominant, the intense fear has subsided, replaced by a more balanced, albeit potentially indecisive, market mood. This shift in crypto market sentiment doesn’t necessarily predict the future, but it reflects the current psychological state of market participants based on various data points. Understanding the Factors Behind the Index Score The index is not based on a single metric but aggregates data from six different sources. Each factor contributes a specific weighting to the final score: 1. Volatility (25%) This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, especially downwards, tends to increase fear, while lower volatility or upward price swings can contribute to a more neutral or greedy score. 2. Market Momentum / Volume (25%) This factor looks at the current market volume and momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong upward momentum indicate a bullish sentiment, pushing the index towards greed. Low volume or selling pressure suggests fear or lack of interest. 3. Social Media (15%) This analyzes keywords related to cryptocurrency on platforms like Twitter. A higher rate of specific posts and hashtags, combined with how quickly they are receiving interactions, can indicate heightened market interest or potential FOMO, contributing to a higher score. 4. Surveys (15%) Although currently paused by Alternative, this factor historically involved weekly polls asking people how they see the market. These surveys aimed to capture direct investor sentiment. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increase in Bitcoin dominance often suggests that investors are moving away from altcoins and into Bitcoin, which can be seen as a safer haven during times of uncertainty (fear). Conversely, decreasing Bitcoin dominance might indicate increased risk appetite as funds flow into altcoins (greed), though this factor’s interpretation can be nuanced. 6. Google Trends (10%) This factor analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin on Google Trends. For example, a sudden surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” could suggest increasing interest and potential greed. This provides insight into retail investor interest and panic levels. What Does ‘Neutral’ Sentiment Imply for Crypto Trends? Moving into the ‘Neutral’ zone (50-50 range, with 52 being just above the midpoint) is often interpreted as a period of indecision or equilibrium in the market. It suggests that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is currently dominating participant behavior. Here are some potential implications for crypto trends : Lack of Clear Direction: The market might trade sideways or exhibit choppy price action as bulls and bears are relatively balanced. Potential Turning Point: Neutrality can precede a significant move in either direction. It’s like a coiled spring, waiting for a catalyst. Increased Sensitivity to News: In a neutral state, the market might be more reactive to external news events, regulations, or macroeconomic data. Focus on Fundamentals: With emotional extremes subdued, market participants might pay closer attention to project developments, adoption rates, and technological advancements. For those monitoring crypto trends , a neutral reading means relying solely on the index is insufficient. It’s a signal to look deeper into other technical and fundamental indicators. How Can Investors Use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? The index is a sentiment tool, not a trading signal in isolation. However, it can be a valuable addition to an investor’s toolkit: Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index as a contrarian signal. High fear (low index value) might be seen as a time to consider buying, while high greed (high index value) might suggest caution or a time to consider selling. The move to neutral might be seen as exiting a potential buying zone (fear) or approaching a potential selling zone (greed), depending on one’s strategy. Market Confirmation: It can help confirm or question signals from other indicators. If technical analysis suggests an oversold market, a high ‘Fear’ reading on the index would support that view. Emotional Check: It can help investors check their own emotions against the prevailing market sentiment. If the index shows extreme greed but you feel fearful, or vice versa, it might prompt you to re-evaluate your position or strategy. Historical Context: Tracking the index over time provides context on market cycles and how sentiment has historically correlated with price movements. Remember, the index is just one data point among many. It’s crucial to combine sentiment analysis with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and a solid understanding of your own risk tolerance and investment goals. Considering Crypto Volatility in the Neutral Zone Even in a ‘Neutral’ sentiment phase, crypto volatility remains a fundamental characteristic of the market. The index’s volatility component contributes 25% to the score, reflecting how significant price swings influence overall sentiment. A neutral index doesn’t mean volatility disappears; it simply means the market isn’t currently driven by panic selling or manic buying based on recent price movements to the extreme degree seen during periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ or ‘Extreme Greed’. Investors should always be prepared for potential price swings, regardless of the index’s current reading. Looking Ahead: What Might Push the Index Further? The index’s next move will depend on shifts in the underlying factors. Positive news regarding regulation, institutional adoption, or significant technological upgrades within major projects could push sentiment towards ‘Greed’. Conversely, negative news, regulatory crackdowns, or significant price drops could quickly send the index back into ‘Fear’. Changes in Bitcoin dominance and broader economic conditions will also play a role in shaping future crypto trends and the corresponding sentiment. Conclusion: A Balanced Pause The Crypto Fear and Greed Index moving to 52, entering the ‘Neutral’ zone, signifies a pause in the previously fearful market sentiment. It suggests a more balanced environment where neither extreme panic nor rampant speculation is currently in control. While this doesn’t provide a clear directional signal, it highlights a potential period of indecision or transition for crypto trends . Understanding the factors influencing the index, from crypto volatility and market momentum to social media buzz and Bitcoin dominance , provides valuable context for investors. Use this index as one tool among many to gauge the market’s emotional temperature, but always combine it with diligent research and analysis before making investment decisions.

2025-06-07T10:40:06,"Could Dogecoin (DOGE) Be Preparing for a Major Surge? Analyst Shares Latest Insights","Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson shared a remarkable analysis of Dogecoin (DOGE) on social media. Wedson suggested that Dogecoin could be preparing for a major rise again, while drawing attention to four important points based on historical data and market indicators. According to Wedson, during Dogecoin’s previous major drop, around $380 million worth of liquidity was trapped at the $0.50 level. The analyst argued that DOGE has shown a strong rally after months of accumulation following such intense short accumulation in the past. Referring to DOGE’s performance against Bitcoin, Wedson stated that the pair is currently approaching the critical support level seen before the 2021 rally. According to Wedson, this could signal a period when Dogecoin could again receive more attention than Bitcoin. Related News: BREAKING: Details of the Buyback and Revenue Model for Token Holders in One of the Largest Airdrops in History Have Been Revealed Looking at the overall health of the memecoin market, Wedson noted that the Memecoin Index, which consists of 16 major memecoins, is showing the first signs of recovery after a deep decline. This suggests that memecoins, including Dogecoin, may be starting to gain traction again. While the memecoin market cap is much larger compared to 2021, Open Interest is still low (around $3.2 billion), according to Wedson, and daily trading volume is also well behind BTC or ETH at just $12 billion. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-07T10:30:20,"OpenAI Startups: Powerful Collaboration for Future Success","BitcoinWorld OpenAI Startups: Powerful Collaboration for Future Success The intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence is creating new frontiers for innovation. For startups navigating this dynamic space, leveraging cutting-edge AI models is not just an option; it’s becoming a necessity for staying competitive. Insights shared at events like Bitcoin World Sessions: AI highlight the practical ways companies can harness this technology. Specifically, discussions featuring experts like Hao Sang from OpenAI’s Startups Team shed light on how OpenAI startups can gain a significant edge by working directly with a leading AI research and deployment company. Understanding OpenAI’s Approach to OpenAI Startups OpenAI recognizes the crucial role startups play in driving innovation and adopting new technologies. They aren’t just building powerful models; they are actively cultivating an ecosystem where emerging companies can thrive by integrating AI. The OpenAI Startups Team is dedicated to supporting these businesses, understanding their unique challenges, and providing resources tailored to their needs. This support goes beyond simple API access; it involves a deeper engagement aimed at helping startups effectively utilize AI to build their core products and services. Key aspects of OpenAI’s support for startups include: Technical Guidance: Offering expertise on model implementation, fine-tuning, and best practices for integrating AI into complex workflows. Resource Access: Providing access to documentation, tutorials, and specialized programs designed for early-stage companies.

Feedback Channels: Creating pathways for startups to provide input on model performance and features, directly influencing OpenAI’s development roadmap. Why AI is Essential for AI for Startups Today In today’s fast-paced market, adopting AI is no longer a luxury but a strategic imperative for many businesses. For AI for startups , integrating artificial intelligence can unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and scalability. AI can automate repetitive tasks, provide deep insights from data, personalize user experiences, and even power entirely new categories of products and services. Startups that successfully integrate AI can often move faster, make smarter decisions, and offer more compelling value propositions than their competitors. Consider these areas where AI offers significant advantages for startups: Product Development: Using AI to build intelligent features, improve user interfaces, or create generative content. Operational Efficiency: Automating customer support, optimizing internal processes, or enhancing data analysis. Market Understanding: Analyzing trends, predicting customer behavior, or personalizing marketing efforts. Risk Management: Identifying anomalies, detecting fraud, or improving security protocols. Leveraging advanced AI models provides startups with capabilities that were once only accessible to large corporations, leveling the playing field and fostering a more competitive landscape. The Power of Partnership: Understanding OpenAI Collaboration Engaging in direct OpenAI collaboration offers startups a unique advantage. It’s not just about using an API; it’s about building a relationship that can accelerate growth and innovation. Hao Sang’s insights underscore that this collaboration is a two-way street. Startups gain access to cutting-edge technology and expert support, while OpenAI receives invaluable real-world feedback that helps refine their models and identify new areas for development. This symbiotic relationship ensures that OpenAI’s tools remain relevant and powerful for the businesses that need them most.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Musk–Trump clash on X sparks $170b market crash as Bitcoin drops and $950m in longs are liquidated fast. When two titans collide, the market feels every shock. Latest token movements here , Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s clash on X didn’t just light up headlines — it shook the financial world. Tesla stock nosedived, crypto took a hit, and within hours, Bitcoin dropped below $101,000 while Ethereum slipped over 6 percent. The fallout wiped out $170 billion from the market. It wasn’t just price drops. Over $950 million in long positions vanished as liquidations swept across exchanges. Trump mocked Musk’s leadership at Tesla, Musk clapped back, and traders scrambled. Was this genuine tension, or a carefully timed shakeup? The debate is on. Some see it as a market reset, designed to scare off weak hands. Others feel it’s just chaos as usual. But for those paying close attention, moments like this are where new opportunities begin. You might also like: SHIB up 15% this month: Time to buy now or is Wall Street Ponke the next 100x meme coin? Crypto markets shudder as two power players go head-to-head The Musk-Trump fallout didn’t just stay on social media. It triggered a wave of panic in markets, especially crypto. While most ran for cover, a handful of investors stayed calm, and looked deeper. They saw beyond the red charts. Some believe this is more than a feud, it could be an intentional move to reset sentiment and prepare for bigger plays ahead. Whatever the truth, it sparked a wave of exits, and quietly, a wave of entries. Because while most were watching the drama, some were watching a new name rise. In the shadows of a sell-off, one memecoin begins to rise As the dust settles from the feud, a quiet stir begins, and Wall Street Ponke is catching that momentum. Built on Ethereum, Wall Street Ponke isn’t just about hype. It’s got real value backing it, AI-powered tools, staking rewards up to 1,185 percent, and a rising presale that’s already surpassed $300,000 in early investments. Wall Street Ponke is inspired by the legendary finance and trading movie “The Wolf of Wall Street,” and it’s carrying that same bold energy into the memecoin space. With a major marketing campaign set to kick off soon, visibility could surge in the coming days. While Pepeto brought frog energy to life, Wall Street Ponke is shifting the memecoin story from whales to builders , and that shift is resonating. Some insiders say this could be the meme token that combines utility, timing, and narrative in a way we haven’t seen since Shiba or Pepe. Why Wall Street Ponke is gaining steam post-dip AI-based trading and anti-scam technology. Fully-audited smart contract for added trust. High-yield staking with rewards up to 1,185 percent. Presale already over $300,000 and counting. Exchange listing announcement expected soon. In a moment when the market is unsure who to trust, Wall Street Ponke is offering more than a meme , it’s delivering structure, tools, and timing.
