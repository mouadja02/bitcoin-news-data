2025-06-07T06:40:40,"CFTC: Crucial Feedback Highlights Future of 24/7 Crypto Trading","BitcoinWorld CFTC: Crucial Feedback Highlights Future of 24/7 Crypto Trading The world of cryptocurrency never sleeps, and neither do its markets. This inherent 24/7 nature presents unique challenges and opportunities, especially when it comes to regulatory oversight. Recently, Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham shed light on a fascinating development: all public feedback received regarding the potential for 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a crucial signal about the future direction of digital asset regulation and financial market oversight. Why is 24/7 Crypto Trading Different? Unlike traditional financial markets, which operate on fixed schedules (think stock exchanges closing for the day), the cryptocurrency market is truly global and non-stop. This fundamental difference is at the heart of the conversation around 24/7 trading for derivatives. When the CFTC, the U.S. regulator for derivatives markets, solicited public comments on potentially moving towards a 24/7 trading model, the response highlighted where the real demand and practical considerations lie: in the crypto space. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Traditional Finance (TradFi) Crypto Markets Trading Hours Fixed, limited (e.g., 9:30 AM – 4:00 PM EST for NYSE) 24/7, non-stop globally Underlying Assets Stocks, bonds, commodities, fiat currencies Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Market Access Often restricted to exchange hours Global, accessible anytime (internet permitting) Regulatory Model Established frameworks built around fixed hours Evolving frameworks adapting to 24/7 nature This constant activity in crypto markets means that events happening overnight or on weekends can have immediate and significant impacts on prices and market conditions. This brings us to the critical point raised by Chairwoman Pham. CFTC and the Push for Real-Time Risk Management According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, Chairwoman Pham specifically noted that 24/7 trading offers clear advantages, particularly from a risk management perspective. In a market that can react instantly to global news, technological developments, or regulatory announcements, having the ability to trade derivatives around the clock allows participants to manage their exposure in real time. Think about it: if a major news event breaks at 2 AM on a Sunday, a market participant holding a crypto derivatives position might face significant risk exposure if they have to wait until Monday morning to adjust their hedge or close their position. 24/7 trading capability would allow for immediate action, potentially mitigating losses and improving overall market stability by allowing for continuous price discovery and risk transfer. The CFTC’s interest in this topic isn’t new. They announced they were soliciting public comments on 24/7 derivatives trading back in April. This proactive step shows the regulator is grappling with how to oversee markets that don’t fit the traditional mold of scheduled trading hours. The fact that the feedback focused solely on crypto derivatives underscores that the industry sees this as a necessity driven by the very nature of digital assets. Why Only Crypto Derivatives? Exploring the Feedback The revelation that feedback on 24/7 trading proposals was limited to crypto-based products and didn’t involve TradFi products is telling. It suggests that while the CFTC cast a wide net, the industry response highlighted that the practical need and infrastructure readiness for 24/7 derivatives trading currently reside almost exclusively within the crypto ecosystem. Why might this be the case? Native 24/7 Infrastructure: Crypto exchanges and trading platforms were built from the ground up to operate non-stop. Their underlying technology, staffing models, and operational procedures are designed for continuous activity. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of crypto markets makes the ability to react instantly to events more critical than in many traditional asset classes. Global Nature: Crypto markets are truly global, with significant trading activity occurring across all time zones. A 24/7 model aligns with this global participant base. TradFi Legacy Systems: Traditional financial infrastructure, while robust, is often built upon legacy systems and operational models that are deeply tied to fixed trading hours and clearing cycles. Shifting these systems to 24/7 operation would be a monumental and costly undertaking, potentially lacking the immediate market demand seen in crypto. This feedback provides the CFTC with clear direction: the immediate regulatory and infrastructure questions surrounding 24/7 derivatives trading are primarily relevant to the rapidly evolving 24/7 crypto trading landscape. Implications for Digital Asset Regulation and Financial Market Oversight What does this mean for the future? The fact that public input is steering the conversation towards crypto indicates that regulators like the CFTC are increasingly focusing their attention and resources on understanding and overseeing digital assets. This isn’t just about trading hours; it’s about developing comprehensive digital asset regulation that accounts for the unique characteristics of this market. Key areas the CFTC and other regulators will likely need to address include: Surveillance and Market Integrity: How to effectively monitor a market for manipulation or misconduct when it never closes. Clearing and Settlement: Adapting clearing and settlement processes, traditionally tied to daily cycles, for continuous operation. Cybersecurity: Ensuring the security of platforms operating 24/7 against constant threats. Coordination: Harmonizing regulatory approaches across different jurisdictions, given the global nature of 24/7 markets. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate safeguards for participants trading around the clock. The feedback on 24/7 trading is a microcosm of the larger challenge facing regulators: how to apply existing frameworks or create new ones for markets that operate fundamentally differently from those they have overseen for decades. The focus on crypto in the feedback suggests that this is where the most pressing needs and potential innovations lie for evolving financial market oversight . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Ecosystem For participants in the crypto market, this development offers several insights: Regulation is Coming, and it’s Tailored: Regulators are actively seeking input on how to best oversee crypto’s unique features. Engaging with these comment periods is vital for the industry to help shape effective regulation. Infrastructure Matters: The ability of crypto platforms to support 24/7 operations is a key differentiator and will likely be a focus for regulatory requirements. Risk Management is Paramount: The emphasis on risk management in the context of 24/7 trading highlights its importance. Platforms and participants should prioritize robust risk frameworks. Derivatives are a Key Focus: The CFTC’s jurisdiction over derivatives means that this area of the crypto market will continue to be under scrutiny and development. The conversation around 24/7 trading for crypto derivatives is a clear indicator that the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system is progressing, bringing with it the need for sophisticated regulatory approaches. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Finance Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham’s comments reveal that the regulatory dialogue around the practicalities of modern trading is being driven by the unique characteristics of the crypto market. The fact that feedback on 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products underscores the inherent differences between digital asset markets and traditional finance, as well as where the immediate challenges and opportunities for regulatory evolution lie. This isn’t just about keeping the lights on; it’s about developing effective risk management, market integrity, and financial market oversight models for a global, always-on financial future. The CFTC’s engagement and the industry’s focused feedback are crucial steps in building the necessary regulatory infrastructure for the growing world of crypto derivatives and the broader landscape of digital asset regulation .

2025-06-07T06:20:06,"SEC ETF Approval: Firms Urgently Push for ‘First to File’ Rule Return","BitcoinWorld SEC ETF Approval: Firms Urgently Push for ‘First to File’ Rule Return The world of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is constantly evolving, marked by significant regulatory hurdles and strategic maneuvers by asset management firms. A recent development highlights this dynamic: three prominent players – VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital – have collectively addressed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a specific request. They are advocating for the reintroduction of a principle known as “first to file, first to approve” within the SEC ETF approval process. Understanding the ‘First to File, First to Approve’ Principle What exactly is this “first to file, first to approve” principle that these firms are so keen on seeing reinstated? In essence, it’s a regulatory guideline that prioritizes the review and potential approval of applications based on the chronological order in which they are submitted. Under this principle, the first firm to successfully file a complete and compliant application for a specific type of financial product, like an ETF, would be the first in line to potentially receive regulatory approval. Think of it like a queue. If multiple firms apply for the same type of ETF, the SEC would theoretically review the application from the firm that submitted it earliest before moving on to the next in line. This approach aims to provide a clear, predictable framework for applicants. Key aspects of this principle typically include: Chronological Priority: Applications are reviewed in the strict order of their submission date and time. Incentive for Preparedness: It encourages firms to be thorough and quick in their initial filings. Predictability: Provides applicants with a clearer idea of when their application might be considered, relative to competitors. Fairness (Debated): Proponents argue it’s fair as it rewards promptness; critics might argue it disadvantages smaller or less resourced firms. This principle isn’t new to the SEC’s processes but its application has varied, particularly in the complex and novel space of cryptocurrency-linked financial products. The Principle’s Past and Present Context: Before Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs As the letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital points out, the “first to file, first to approve” principle was indeed a part of the SEC’s ETF review process historically. This was the standard procedure for many traditional asset classes and even some earlier, less complex crypto-linked products like Bitcoin futures ETFs. However, the landscape shifted significantly with the applications for spot Bitcoin ETF and later, spot Ethereum ETF products. The review process for these novel and highly anticipated products seemed to deviate from the strict chronological order. While there was a rush of applications, the SEC’s deliberations appeared to take a different path, potentially evaluating multiple applications concurrently or considering broader market and regulatory readiness factors beyond just the filing date. The eventual approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously in January 2024, despite varying application dates, is a prime example of the SEC not strictly adhering to a “first to file” rule in that specific instance. This deviation, while perhaps necessary from the SEC’s perspective to ensure market readiness and investor protection across multiple potential issuers, created uncertainty for applicants regarding the review timeline and competitive dynamics. Why Are VanEck, 21Shares & Canary Capital Pushing Now? The timing of this letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital is strategic, coming after the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and amidst ongoing discussions and applications for other crypto assets, most notably the potential Ethereum ETF approvals. Their motivation stems from a desire for greater clarity, predictability, and perceived fairness in the regulatory process for future crypto-based ETFs. Here are some potential reasons behind their push: Leveling the Playing Field: Reintroducing the principle could create a more predictable competitive environment. Firms know that getting their application in early gives them a potential advantage in the review queue. Streamlining the Process: A clear order might help streamline the SEC’s internal review process, potentially leading to faster decisions once a precedent is set for a particular asset class (like Ethereum). Reducing Uncertainty: The current process, which doesn’t strictly follow filing order, can be unpredictable for firms investing significant resources in applications. “First to file” offers a degree of certainty regarding review priority. Encouraging Preparedness: It incentivizes firms to be diligent and prepared with high-quality applications from the outset to secure an early spot in the queue. Learning from Bitcoin ETF Experience: The experience with the Bitcoin ETF approvals, where multiple issuers were approved concurrently, highlighted the departure from the old principle. Firms may prefer the structure of the previous system for future filings. By jointly penning this letter, these firms are signaling to the SEC the industry’s desire for a return to what they see as a more transparent and predictable review mechanism. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Reinstating the Principle Bringing back “first to file, first to approve” for all crypto ETFs could have various impacts: Potential Benefits: Increased Efficiency: Could simplify the SEC’s workflow by focusing on one application at a time for a specific product type. Clear Timelines (Relative): Provides applicants with a clearer understanding of their position in the queue. Rewards Early Movers: Firms that invest early in understanding regulatory requirements and preparing applications are potentially rewarded. Reduced Speculation: Might reduce market speculation around which specific issuer will be approved first, shifting focus to when the first one might be approved. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Quality vs. Speed: Could incentivize rushing applications to be first, potentially at the expense of thoroughness or quality, creating more work for the SEC. Complexity of Crypto: Crypto assets involve unique custodial, valuation, and market manipulation concerns that might require the SEC to review multiple applications to understand best practices or potential risks across the board before approving any. Market Readiness: The SEC might feel a responsibility to ensure the market is ready for a new product type and that multiple compliant options are available, rather than just approving the first one regardless of how many others are close behind. Disadvantage to Latecomers: Firms that enter the race later, perhaps due to needing more time for preparation or technological development, could be significantly disadvantaged. The SEC’s decision on whether to reinstate this principle will likely weigh these factors, balancing the industry’s desire for predictability against the regulator’s mandate to protect investors and ensure market integrity, especially in the volatile crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs? The request from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital underscores the industry’s ongoing engagement with regulators and its efforts to shape the future of crypto financial products. While the SEC is not obligated to revert to the “first to file, first to approve” rule, the letter adds to the dialogue around how these applications should be handled. For investors and market watchers, this highlights the regulatory nuances behind the launch of products like a potential Ethereum ETF. The SEC’s approach to reviewing these applications will significantly impact not only which firms get approved but also the timeline for their market entry. Keep an eye on official SEC communications and reports from analysts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, who initially reported on this letter via X, for updates on how the SEC responds to this industry request and what it signals for the future of SEC ETF approval processes for cryptocurrencies. In Conclusion: A Call for Predictability in SEC ETF Approval The joint letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital serves as a clear signal to the SEC: key players in the crypto ETF space are seeking a return to a more predictable and chronological review process. By urging the reinstatement of the “first to file, first to approve” principle, they aim to streamline future applications, particularly for assets like Ethereum, building on the foundational work done during the intense period leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. While the SEC’s decision remains to be seen, this development highlights the ongoing push-and-pull between regulatory caution and industry innovation. A more transparent review process could benefit all market participants by providing clarity and potentially accelerating the availability of regulated crypto investment products, but the SEC must balance this against its primary mission of investor protection.

Trump says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with Chinese representatives in London on Monday to discuss the trade deal. “The meeting should go very well. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Last month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market. But last week, Trump claimed on Truth Social that China breached the terms of the deal. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!!

It also raises questions about political holdings of crypto assets without crypto regulations in place. Here’s a swift breakdown of his crypto earnings. It will be eye-opening for many! Where the Money Came From Trump’s earnings come from a mix of token sales and memecoin holdings. The report claims he made $390 million, before taxes, through the sale of tokens from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform connected to his brand. He also earned $315 million from the TRUMP memecoin and an additional $427 million from other memecoin assets. On top of that, Trump is believed to hold up to $60 million in World Liberty Financial’s new stablecoin, USD1. Altogether, his total crypto income is estimated at $1.2 billion, with post-tax profits around $935 million. Private Dinner Raises Eyebrows Trump’s growing involvement in crypto drew more attention following a private dinner at his golf club near Washington, D.C., on May 22. The event was attended by the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token. Among them was Tron founder Justin Sun, reportedly the largest holder, with $18 million worth of tokens at the time. Sun has also invested $93 million into Trump-linked crypto projects, including $75 million into World Liberty Financial. His presence has sparked concerns about possible foreign influence, especially given Trump’s ongoing 2024 presidential campaign. Critics Question Ethics, But Profits Speak Loudly The scale of Trump’s crypto earnings has raised questions around transparency and ethics. Critics warn that large foreign investments in ventures tied to a presidential candidate could present serious risks. Investor and former White House official Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the growing inequality within Trump’s crypto venture. Citing data from Chainalysis, he noted that 58 wallets have made over $10 million each from the TRUMP memecoin, totaling $1.1 billion in profits, while around 764,000 wallets, mostly held by small investors, are in the red. Scaramucci also pointed to the exclusive nature of Trump’s May 22 event, which included a private reception and White House tour for the top 25 wallet holders, raising fresh concerns over insider access and favoritism.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trump-net-worth-boosted-by-crypto/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T05:30:41,"Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger","Bitcoin dipped to $103,450 yesterday, wiping out about $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours. Many traders hurried to sell, but the fall was short-lived. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there’s still room for more growth. Bitcoin cycles are identical… – In 2016, $BTC grew by 280%, 365 days after Halving – In 2020, $BTC grew by 550%, 367 days after Halving – Now, 416 days post-Halving, $BTC +70% — growth ahead… History repeats, here’s $BTC’s near future🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/wshX4egwbC — Klarck (@0xklarck) June 5, 2025 These percentages matter because they hint at what might come next. If Bitcoin’s history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described—after the initial rise, there’s often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle’s build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn’t offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor’s Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000—a rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch’s outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin’s price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story.

2025-06-07T05:30:13,"Bitcoin Sell-Off Warning? Miner-To-Exchange Transfers Hit Historic Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a mild sell-off yesterday, hitting a daily low of $100,372 on Binance crypto exchange. However, recent on-chain data suggests the price slump may persist, as BTC miners continue transferring coins to exchanges at unprecedented levels. Bitcoin Miners-To-Exchange Transfers Hit Record High According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnchain, the total realized inflow from Bitcoin miners to exchanges has surged to historic highs. This spike likely contributed to the recent price tumble from the mid-$100,000 range. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin miners’ total realized inflow to exchanges measures the actual amount of BTC that miners have transferred from their wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. A sharp rise in this metric typically signals that miners are selling more of their holdings, which can increase supply in the market and potentially drive prices down. CryptoOnchain shared the following chart showing miners’ inflows surpassing $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28, 2025. If this trend continues, BTC could face a deeper correction, potentially falling into the low $90,000 range. A similar trend was observed earlier this year in January when BTC was in the midst of a historical rally, creating multiple new all-time highs (ATH) in quick succession. At the time, BTC miners offloaded close to 140,000 coins for roughly $13.72 billion. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out another bearish signal. In an X post, he noted that the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) – a sign that may lead to further selling pressure. When the MVRV ratio falls below its 200-day SMA, it suggests that the average market participant is holding Bitcoin at a loss or near break-even. This often indicates bearish sentiment or undervaluation, which can trigger further selling among small investors. BTC Holders Cautiously Optimistic Adding to the rising uncertainty, yesterday’s public feud between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk further dampened market sentiment. Some analysts now predict BTC could fall as low as $96,000. Fellow crypto analyst Anup Ziddi made a similar bearish forecast. The analyst recently stated that as long as BTC remains below $107,000, its chances of further crashes will remain elevated. That said, there are still reasons for cautious optimism. Recent on-chain data shows that new Bitcoin whales are aggressively accumulating the asset, reinforcing the potential for a future supply squeeze. At press time, BTC is trading at $104,963, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sell-off-warning-miner-to-exchange-transfers-hit-historic-highs/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|200-Day SMA|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miners|Bitcoin MVRV Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|miners to exchange transfers|mining|on-chain analysis",cryptocompare

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past 24 hours following yesterday’s correction, led by a substantial pump from SUI. BTC Recovered $5K The business week started on the right foot for BTC, which jumped to $106,500 on a couple of occasions on Monday and Tuesday. However, it saw little success there, and the subsequent rejections pushed it south by about two grand. It jumped once again on Thursday after the ECB cut the interest rates to 2%, but was halted at $106,000. The online spat saga that transpired between the former allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, further intensified the sell-off and BTC dumped hard to $100,400 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally stepped up at this point and prevented another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover and jumped to $105,500 in midday trading on Friday. It couldn’t continue upward and now sits below $105,000, but it’s still 2% up on the day. Its market cap has recovered to $2.080 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView SUI Bounces Hard Most altcoins tumbled on Friday but have posted impressive gains on a daily scale. Still, Ethereum continues to struggle below $2,500 following a minor jump. RP has recovered to $2.17 after a 2% increase, and similar gains are evident from BNB, SOL, DOGE, and ADA. SUI has emerged as today’s top performer, having surged by almost 9%. It now trades above $3.25. In contrast, HYPE has marked a slight decline of around 2% and is below $34 as of press time. The total crypto market cap has added over $50 billion since yesterday’s low.

Although the firm has not clarified its reason for the fundraising, the company’s actions in the last few weeks raise speculation as to whether a part of the fund will be geared toward more bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions. According to the filing , TMTG intends to raise up to $12 billion by offering its common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units to investors. TMTG to Raise $12B The terms of the offering will be provided in prospectus supplements filed with time. For now, TMTG has clarified that it intends to sell 84.6 million shares of its common stock at a value of $0.0001 each. TMTG will sell 55.8 million shares to institutional investors in a private placement at $25.72 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.44 billion. The company will also offer 28.8 million shares issuable upon conversion of its 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2028 for an aggregate amount of $1 billion. The company noted that it has the flexibility to sell the shares at varying prices through different channels, including underwriters, dealers, and agents. “We provide more information about how we and the Selling Securityholders may sell the securities in the section entitled ‘Plan of Distribution.’ We will receive proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Shares by the Selling Securityholders pursuant to this prospectus,” the firm stated in the prospectus. The $2.5B BTC Purchase Earlier last week, TMTG reportedly disclosed that it was raising $3 billion to buy BTC. About 24 hours later, news emerged that the company had raised approximately $2.5 billion to implement its BTC acquisition plan. The firm raised the funds by selling $1.5 billion in stock and $1 billion in convertible notes priced at a 35% premium. TMTG holds the BTC on its balance sheet, while digital asset platforms Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital provide custody for the assets. TMTG’s latest BTC purchase and the intensifying wave of Bitcoin adoption in the corporate sector are fueling speculation that the $12 billion raised will be targeted at more BTC acquisitions. It remains to be seen whether this plays out as speculated.

That’s a dramatic leap from its original 21,000 BTC target. To fund the expansion, the firm will issue up to 555 million new shares, raising $5.4 billion , according to CEO Simon Gerovich.

The company’s stretch goal? Holding 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Such long-term commitment could significantly tighten supply and increase institutional FOMO, fueling upward pressure on BTC prices. Bitcoin Chart Eyes Breakout; Institutions Show Up Bitcoin’s recent bounce from $100,519 has formed higher lows and is now approaching a key descending trendline. BTC sits just above the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, a sign that momentum is building. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The key resistance range lies between $105,000 and $106,300, where horizontal resistance intersects with the trendline. Bitcoin price prediction may turn bullish upon a breakout above this level; the next upside target is $107,600. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has also returned to the buying table. His firm is launching a $1 billion stock offering to expand its Bitcoin holdings, following an initial raise of four times its target of $250 million.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative On Binance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, BTC funding rates on Binance have once again turned negative, even as the top cryptocurrency continues to trade above the $100,000 mark at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows The analyst attributed the sudden reversal in funding – from +0.003 to -0.004 – to the public spat between Trump and Musk on social media. This rapid shift reflects growing fear among market participants amid heightened uncertainty. Following the sentiment shift, BTC fell from the mid-$100,000 range to a low of $100,984, according to CoinGecko. Over the past two weeks, the asset has declined by 4.1%. That said, the current dip may offer a prime buying opportunity to investors. If Bitcoin rebounds strongly, it could result in a strong resurgence in buying pressure, leading to a short squeeze that may propel BTC’s price further up. Darkfost highlighted that there have been three instances during the current market cycle when BTC witnessed such deep negative funding. Notably, each of these instances were followed by a strong upward move in the cryptocurrency. For example, on October 16, 2023, BTC dipped into negative funding territory before rallying from $28,000 to $73,000. A similar pattern played out on September 9, 2024, when the asset surged from $57,000 to $108,000. The most recent case was on May 2, 2025, when BTC jumped from $97,000 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,000. If history repeats, then the market may see a new ATH for BTC in the coming weeks. Darkfost noted: Such extreme readings often mark moments of maximum pessimism, precisely the kind of sentiment that can precede a strong bullish reversal when the short term negativity is gone. Large Investors Increase BTC Exposure Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales – wallets holding large amounts of BTC – continue to accumulate at a rapid pace. Notably, new whales have acquired BTC worth $63 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the asset’s near-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Supporting this bullish outlook, recent analysis by QCR Capital indicates that large investors expect BTC to surge to as high as $130,000 by the end of Q3 2025.

That said, some analysts urge caution, expecting BTC to crash below $100,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,069, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-07T01:40:22,"Tech giants explore stablecoin integration","Tech behemoths Apple, Google, Airbnb, and X (formerly Twitter), among others, are reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins into their platforms, according to multiple industry sources familiar with the matter. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets , such as the US dollar. They provide the advantages of blockchain but without the volatility that has plagued more traditional crypto tokens like Bitcoin. These discussions are occurring as demand increases for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. The positives are also obvious for tech companies like Airbnb, which are globally reachable. Accepting stablecoins could also avert steep fees charged by credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. An Airbnb spokesperson said that the company is “always looking at all aspects of payments” for improving user experience , but it is also looking into digital assets. According to previous reports, X has reportedly expressed an interest in adding stablecoin payments to its upcoming payments product, X Money. According to sources, Elon Musk’s team has been in touch with crypto companies, and the company is in talks with Stripe about integration. The aim is to realize Musk’s ideal of an “ everything app ” that blends social media, payments, and commerce. Apple is also keen on stablecoin functionality through its Apple Pay infrastructure. Sources hint the tech firm has been in talks with Circle, the minters of the hugely popular USDC stablecoin, since early this year. Google was interested, too, it was reported. Rich Widmann, who leads Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, has called stablecoins “one of the biggest upgrades to payments since the SWIFT network.” Stripe bets on stablecoins with bold acquisition Stripe, one of the world’s largest payment processors, has made a bold bet. It recently purchased Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure startup with funding from vendor capital firm Haun Ventures. Bridge has been working on tools to enable businesses to implement stablecoin payments quickly and securely. Stripe’s purchase of Bridge was interpreted as a sign that stablecoins have turned the corner in Silicon Valley. The deal also gave Stripe a technical advantage — Bridge’s infrastructure will be used to assist Stripe in making it possible for accounts and payments to be made in a stablecoin, which is important for global freelancers and marketplaces. Visa has followed suit by rolling out pilots for issuing stablecoin-linked cards with Bridge in April 2025. The sources say Airbnb is discussing with one of its existing payment partners the incorporation of one of the popular stablecoins to facilitate easy payment processes. Worldpay recently disclosed that it would facilitate stablecoin payouts by partnering with BNVK, a crypto infrastructure provider. Trump administration eases crypto regulations In the United States, legislators are considering two bills to regulate stablecoins. The most high-profile, known as the GENIUS Act , details consumer protections, reserve requirements, and oversight mechanisms for issuers of digital dollars. Big Tech was hesitant about crypto in part because of scrutiny under the Biden administration. But the political winds are shifting. The second term of Donald Trump has injected vitality into the realm of blockchain. His administration has pursued a more hands-off approach, pushing agencies to roll back rules and embrace crypto innovation. This policy change has reawakened some dormant dreams. Two years after regulatory opposition forced Meta to mothball its Diem stablecoin project, the parent company reconsidered its views on crypto payments. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said recently that the ride-hailing company is examining the use of stablecoins for its global transfers. Uber’s interest is further evidence of a broader trend circulating throughout tech circles, not just a niche idea. For now, the tone is most cautious among most firms, including Google and Airbnb. They are not promising instant launches. However, their research, alliances, and internal experiments indicate that they are gaining confidence in the future for stablecoins.

Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data.

This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. 🔔When Funding rates turns negative. 🔹 Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

2025-06-07T01:14:36,"Will Fidelity’s stablecoin transform the crypto market?","Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s most respected financial institutions, has made significant strides in digital assets in recent years. The firm offers institutional clients Bitcoin and Ethereum custody and trading services through Fidelity Digital Assets. It has also explored blockchain applications in settlement and tokenized securities—efforts that underline its long-term commitment to bridging traditional and digital finance. While there is no official confirmation, a representative of Fidelity recently said that the firm’s digital asset arm was experimenting with a stablecoin. However, it did not have immediate plans to launch one. The arrival of Fidelity into stablecoins will likely bring more trust, attention, and skills to the stablecoin ecosystem. However, it could also invite tougher scrutiny from regulators and raise concerns about fairness or the likelihood that a handful of large players could dominate the market . Some people believe Fidelity’s new stablecoin will help provide safer, more reliable digital payment options. However, critics say it could create problems with oversight, limit competition, and concentrate too much power in the hands of a few large firms. How does Fidelity’s stablecoin help innovation? Reports indicate that Fidelity has a pilot program for a stablecoin backed by the US dollar to make faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments and settlements than traditional methods. The company wants to build a bridge between old and new finance, and its investment shows that trusted, well-established financial institutions see stablecoins as a serious and credible part of the future financial system. Some crypto experts suggest Fidelity’s move will push banks, payment providers, and fintech companies to adopt blockchain technology faster and improve their services due to the growing competition. Blockchain experts also pointed out the success of Fidelity’s early pilot programs, saying the trials show promising results that could fuel optimism among other big players and make digital financial systems more accessible for everyone. What risks come with Fidelity’s stablecoin? Some critics say unclear rules for digital currencies make it hard for investors, companies, and regulators to know what’s fair or how to keep the market safe. Others, though, fear that large firms like Fidelity will crowd out small start-ups and prevent these new and innovative businesses from getting a fair shot at competition and that the end result will be less fresh ideas and new competition. Some people fear that if just a handful of big companies dominate most stablecoins, it could risk the entire financial system if any one of them encounters trouble. They also worry about whether these companies will be truthful when they claim to manage their reserves responsibly and to keep users safe. Fidelity’s stablecoin initiative is part of a larger trend where many traditional banks and fintech companies actively develop their own stablecoins or explore blockchain technology to improve payment systems and financial services. Those advantages have attracted the attention of political leaders and regulators who agree there is an opportunity for the industry to expand and offer benefits to more people but have also sought to create clear rules to remove the risks associated with these tokens and to shield consumers from potential harm. Some crypto projects are concerned that large finance companies like Fidelity will use their vast amounts of resources to take over a large part of the crypto space and discourage new innovations from startups, which beats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. As a result, there is a growing push and pull between industry experts who want regulators to create soft laws that will help the crypto industry grow by making it fair for small companies to compete with large firms and those who want strict rules that will protect everyone from the dominance of large financial institutions. What does Fidelity’s stablecoin mean for the future? People and financial firms that have doubts about cryptocurrencies will get a positive perspective about investing in digital currency when they see Fidelity’s stablecoin initiative succeed. Big banks and fintech companies will also be motivated to develop their own stablecoins or develop new blockchain solutions to help make digital finance accessible to a wider audience. We still can’t ignore the risks involved because it is possible that large firms like Fidelity might try to dominate the crypto market once they see the company succeed. This means they will have more influence on whether they are worthy of joining the crypto space, which would make it difficult for smaller firms to compete. The current laws around cryptocurrency also don’t fully address the problems big companies bring when they introduce their own coins. This is because these firms must follow heavy compliance requirements and need tight supervision that smaller companies will struggle to keep up with. The success or failure of Fidelity’s stablecoin will likely shape the future of both traditional finance and the crypto world, influencing how open, fair, and innovative this industry can become.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock’s ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether’s price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-can-rising-demand-from-blackrock-fuel-bullish-momentum/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The New York Federal Reserve Bank, which handles the Fed’s bond transactions, just disclosed the losses, linking them to the central bank’s tight monetary stance. The Fed’s bonds are losing value as the bank maintains higher-for-longer interest rates in a push to fight inflation. The agency says it will ensure the losses won’t hit its bottom line or cash transfers to the Treasury. “The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA portfolio has no effect on net income or Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury unless assets are sold and gains or losses are realized. Unrealized gains and losses have no effect on the conduct of monetary policy.” The New York Fed also notes the unrealized losses, which are recorded through the end of 2024, were offset slightly as the central bank let bonds mature without reinvesting. The Fed’s bond portfolio began witnessing significant unrealized losses over the previous two years, clocking $1.08 trillion in 2022 and $948.4 billion in 2023. The account witnessed unrealized gains of $354 billion in 2020 and $127.9 billion in 2021.

2025-06-07T00:00:51,"Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That’s Forming","After days of fluctuating around the $105,000 range, Bitcoin appears to be succumbing to pressure from bears and profit-taking from traders. The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head’s peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin’s daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-dead-cat-bounce-or-full-blown-rebound/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world’s leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the “Big Beautiful Bill” criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance’s net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions—particularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump—injecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher.
