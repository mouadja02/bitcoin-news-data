According to a Forbes report published on June 5, Trump‚Äôs net worth has now reached $5.6 billion, with nearly half of his liquid assets linked to cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 ‚Äî Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 With this open revelation, Trump and his family are once again on critics‚Äô radar, who think that while Trump made millions, many crypto investors lost their money in his PUMP and DUMP schemes. It also raises questions about political holdings of crypto assets without crypto regulations in place. Here‚Äôs a swift breakdown of his crypto earnings. It will be eye-opening for many! Where the Money Came From Trump‚Äôs earnings come from a mix of token sales and memecoin holdings. The report claims he made $390 million, before taxes, through the sale of tokens from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform connected to his brand. He also earned $315 million from the TRUMP memecoin and an additional $427 million from other memecoin assets. On top of that, Trump is believed to hold up to $60 million in World Liberty Financial‚Äôs new stablecoin, USD1. Altogether, his total crypto income is estimated at $1.2 billion, with post-tax profits around $935 million. Private Dinner Raises Eyebrows Trump‚Äôs growing involvement in crypto drew more attention following a private dinner at his golf club near Washington, D.C., on May 22. The event was attended by the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token. Among them was Tron founder Justin Sun, reportedly the largest holder, with $18 million worth of tokens at the time. Sun has also invested $93 million into Trump-linked crypto projects, including $75 million into World Liberty Financial. His presence has sparked concerns about possible foreign influence, especially given Trump‚Äôs ongoing 2024 presidential campaign. Critics Question Ethics, But Profits Speak Loudly The scale of Trump‚Äôs crypto earnings has raised questions around transparency and ethics. Critics warn that large foreign investments in ventures tied to a presidential candidate could present serious risks. Investor and former White House official Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the growing inequality within Trump‚Äôs crypto venture. Citing data from Chainalysis, he noted that 58 wallets have made over $10 million each from the TRUMP memecoin, totaling $1.1 billion in profits, while around 764,000 wallets, mostly held by small investors, are in the red. Scaramucci also pointed to the exclusive nature of Trump‚Äôs May 22 event, which included a private reception and White House tour for the top 25 wallet holders, raising fresh concerns over insider access and favoritism.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trump-net-worth-boosted-by-crypto/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T05:30:41,"Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger","Bitcoin dipped to $103,450 yesterday, wiping out about $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours. Many traders hurried to sell, but the fall was short-lived. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there‚Äôs still room for more growth. Bitcoin cycles are identical‚Ä¶ ‚Äì In 2016, $BTC grew by 280%, 365 days after Halving ‚Äì In 2020, $BTC grew by 550%, 367 days after Halving ‚Äì Now, 416 days post-Halving, $BTC +70% ‚Äî growth ahead‚Ä¶ History repeats, here‚Äôs $BTC‚Äôs near futureüßµüëá pic.twitter.com/wshX4egwbC ‚Äî Klarck (@0xklarck) June 5, 2025 These percentages matter because they hint at what might come next. If Bitcoin‚Äôs history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described‚Äîafter the initial rise, there‚Äôs often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle‚Äôs build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn‚Äôt offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market‚ÄîData Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000‚Äîa rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch‚Äôs outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin‚Äôs price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story.

2025-06-07T05:30:13,"Bitcoin Sell-Off Warning? Miner-To-Exchange Transfers Hit Historic Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a mild sell-off yesterday, hitting a daily low of $100,372 on Binance crypto exchange. However, recent on-chain data suggests the price slump may persist, as BTC miners continue transferring coins to exchanges at unprecedented levels. Bitcoin Miners-To-Exchange Transfers Hit Record High According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnchain, the total realized inflow from Bitcoin miners to exchanges has surged to historic highs. This spike likely contributed to the recent price tumble from the mid-$100,000 range. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin miners‚Äô total realized inflow to exchanges measures the actual amount of BTC that miners have transferred from their wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. A sharp rise in this metric typically signals that miners are selling more of their holdings, which can increase supply in the market and potentially drive prices down. CryptoOnchain shared the following chart showing miners‚Äô inflows surpassing $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28, 2025. If this trend continues, BTC could face a deeper correction, potentially falling into the low $90,000 range. A similar trend was observed earlier this year in January when BTC was in the midst of a historical rally, creating multiple new all-time highs (ATH) in quick succession. At the time, BTC miners offloaded close to 140,000 coins for roughly $13.72 billion. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out another bearish signal. In an X post, he noted that the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) ‚Äì a sign that may lead to further selling pressure. When the MVRV ratio falls below its 200-day SMA, it suggests that the average market participant is holding Bitcoin at a loss or near break-even. This often indicates bearish sentiment or undervaluation, which can trigger further selling among small investors. BTC Holders Cautiously Optimistic Adding to the rising uncertainty, yesterday‚Äôs public feud between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk further dampened market sentiment. Some analysts now predict BTC could fall as low as $96,000. Fellow crypto analyst Anup Ziddi made a similar bearish forecast. The analyst recently stated that as long as BTC remains below $107,000, its chances of further crashes will remain elevated. That said, there are still reasons for cautious optimism. Recent on-chain data shows that new Bitcoin whales are aggressively accumulating the asset, reinforcing the potential for a future supply squeeze. At press time, BTC is trading at $104,963, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sell-off-warning-miner-to-exchange-transfers-hit-historic-highs/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|200-Day SMA|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miners|Bitcoin MVRV Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|miners to exchange transfers|mining|on-chain analysis",cryptocompare

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past 24 hours following yesterday‚Äôs correction, led by a substantial pump from SUI. BTC Recovered $5K The business week started on the right foot for BTC, which jumped to $106,500 on a couple of occasions on Monday and Tuesday. However, it saw little success there, and the subsequent rejections pushed it south by about two grand. It jumped once again on Thursday after the ECB cut the interest rates to 2%, but was halted at $106,000. The online spat saga that transpired between the former allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, further intensified the sell-off and BTC dumped hard to $100,400 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally stepped up at this point and prevented another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover and jumped to $105,500 in midday trading on Friday. It couldn‚Äôt continue upward and now sits below $105,000, but it‚Äôs still 2% up on the day.

Although the firm has not clarified its reason for the fundraising, the company‚Äôs actions in the last few weeks raise speculation as to whether a part of the fund will be geared toward more bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions. According to the filing , TMTG intends to raise up to $12 billion by offering its common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units to investors. TMTG to Raise $12B The terms of the offering will be provided in prospectus supplements filed with time. For now, TMTG has clarified that it intends to sell 84.6 million shares of its common stock at a value of $0.0001 each. TMTG will sell 55.8 million shares to institutional investors in a private placement at $25.72 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.44 billion. The company will also offer 28.8 million shares issuable upon conversion of its 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2028 for an aggregate amount of $1 billion. The company noted that it has the flexibility to sell the shares at varying prices through different channels, including underwriters, dealers, and agents. ‚ÄúWe provide more information about how we and the Selling Securityholders may sell the securities in the section entitled ‚ÄòPlan of Distribution.‚Äô We will receive proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units.

The $2.5B BTC Purchase Earlier last week, TMTG reportedly disclosed that it was raising $3 billion to buy BTC. About 24 hours later, news emerged that the company had raised approximately $2.5 billion to implement its BTC acquisition plan. The firm raised the funds by selling $1.5 billion in stock and $1 billion in convertible notes priced at a 35% premium. TMTG holds the BTC on its balance sheet, while digital asset platforms Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital provide custody for the assets.

2025-06-07T03:00:49,"Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance ‚Äì A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze?","As political tensions between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk escalated yesterday, the Bitcoin (BTC) market experienced a sharp shift in sentiment, with the funding rate on Binance flipping from positive to negative within hours. Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative On Binance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, BTC funding rates on Binance have once again turned negative, even as the top cryptocurrency continues to trade above the $100,000 mark at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‚ÄòHighly Likely‚Äô To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows The analyst attributed the sudden reversal in funding ‚Äì from +0.003 to -0.004 ‚Äì to the public spat between Trump and Musk on social media. This rapid shift reflects growing fear among market participants amid heightened uncertainty. Following the sentiment shift, BTC fell from the mid-$100,000 range to a low of $100,984, according to CoinGecko. Over the past two weeks, the asset has declined by 4.1%. That said, the current dip may offer a prime buying opportunity to investors. If Bitcoin rebounds strongly, it could result in a strong resurgence in buying pressure, leading to a short squeeze that may propel BTC‚Äôs price further up. Darkfost highlighted that there have been three instances during the current market cycle when BTC witnessed such deep negative funding. Notably, each of these instances were followed by a strong upward move in the cryptocurrency. For example, on October 16, 2023, BTC dipped into negative funding territory before rallying from $28,000 to $73,000. A similar pattern played out on September 9, 2024, when the asset surged from $57,000 to $108,000. The most recent case was on May 2, 2025, when BTC jumped from $97,000 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,000. If history repeats, then the market may see a new ATH for BTC in the coming weeks. Darkfost noted: Such extreme readings often mark moments of maximum pessimism, precisely the kind of sentiment that can precede a strong bullish reversal when the short term negativity is gone. Large Investors Increase BTC Exposure Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales ‚Äì wallets holding large amounts of BTC ‚Äì continue to accumulate at a rapid pace. Notably, new whales have acquired BTC worth $63 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the asset‚Äôs near-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Supporting this bullish outlook, recent analysis by QCR Capital indicates that large investors expect BTC to surge to as high as $130,000 by the end of Q3 2025. Additionally, the realized cap held by long-term holders has surpassed $20 billion, reinforcing positive sentiment. That said, some analysts urge caution, expecting BTC to crash below $100,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,069, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-07T01:40:22,"Tech giants explore stablecoin integration","Tech behemoths Apple, Google, Airbnb, and X (formerly Twitter), among others, are reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins into their platforms, according to multiple industry sources familiar with the matter. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets , such as the US dollar. They provide the advantages of blockchain but without the volatility that has plagued more traditional crypto tokens like Bitcoin. These discussions are occurring as demand increases for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. The positives are also obvious for tech companies like Airbnb, which are globally reachable. Accepting stablecoins could also avert steep fees charged by credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. An Airbnb spokesperson said that the company is ‚Äúalways looking at all aspects of payments‚Äù for improving user experience , but it is also looking into digital assets. According to previous reports, X has reportedly expressed an interest in adding stablecoin payments to its upcoming payments product, X Money. According to sources, Elon Musk‚Äôs team has been in touch with crypto companies, and the company is in talks with Stripe about integration. The aim is to realize Musk‚Äôs ideal of an ‚Äú everything app ‚Äù that blends social media, payments, and commerce. Apple is also keen on stablecoin functionality through its Apple Pay infrastructure. Sources hint the tech firm has been in talks with Circle, the minters of the hugely popular USDC stablecoin, since early this year. Google was interested, too, it was reported. Rich Widmann, who leads Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, has called stablecoins ‚Äúone of the biggest upgrades to payments since‚ÄÇthe SWIFT network.‚Äù Stripe bets on stablecoins with bold acquisition Stripe, one of the world‚Äôs largest payment processors, has made a bold bet. It recently purchased Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure startup with funding from vendor capital firm Haun Ventures. Bridge has been working on tools to enable businesses to implement stablecoin payments quickly and securely. Stripe‚Äôs purchase of Bridge was interpreted as a sign that stablecoins have turned the corner in Silicon Valley. The deal also gave Stripe a technical advantage ‚Äî Bridge‚Äôs infrastructure will be used to assist Stripe in making it possible for accounts and payments to be made in a stablecoin, which is important for global freelancers and marketplaces. Visa has followed suit by rolling out pilots for issuing stablecoin-linked cards with Bridge in April 2025. The sources say Airbnb is discussing with one of its existing payment partners the incorporation of one of the popular stablecoins to facilitate easy payment processes. Worldpay recently disclosed that it would facilitate stablecoin payouts by partnering with BNVK, a crypto infrastructure provider. Trump administration eases crypto regulations In the United States, legislators are considering two bills to regulate stablecoins. The most high-profile, known as the GENIUS Act , details consumer protections, reserve requirements, and oversight mechanisms for issuers of digital dollars. Big Tech was hesitant about crypto in part because of scrutiny under the Biden administration. But the political winds are shifting. The second term of Donald Trump has injected vitality into the realm of blockchain. His administration has pursued a more hands-off approach, pushing agencies to roll back rules and embrace crypto innovation. This policy change has reawakened some dormant dreams. Two years after regulatory opposition forced Meta to mothball its Diem stablecoin project, the parent company reconsidered its views on crypto payments. Uber‚Äôs chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said recently that the ride-hailing company is examining the use of stablecoins for its global transfers. Uber‚Äôs interest is further evidence of a broader trend circulating throughout tech circles, not just a niche idea. For now, the tone is most cautious among most firms, including Google and Airbnb. They are not promising instant launches. However, their research, alliances, and internal experiments indicate that they are gaining confidence in the future for stablecoins.

2025-06-07T01:30:53,"Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows","Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply over the past 24 hours, nearing the $100,000 mark with an intraday low of $100,984. This price movement reflects increased volatility across the crypto market following a public exchange on social media between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 Derivative Metrics Reveal Bearish Sentiment Spike According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Binance net taker volume, a metric that measures the difference between aggressive longs and shorts, fell dramatically from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. üîîWhen Funding rates turns negative. üîπ Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

2025-06-07T01:14:36,"Will Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin transform the crypto market?","Fidelity Investments, one of the world‚Äôs most respected financial institutions, has made significant strides in digital assets in recent years. The firm offers institutional clients Bitcoin and Ethereum custody and trading services through Fidelity Digital Assets. It has also explored blockchain applications in settlement and tokenized securities‚Äîefforts that underline its long-term commitment to bridging traditional and digital finance. While there is no official confirmation, a representative of Fidelity recently said that the firm‚Äôs digital asset arm was experimenting with a stablecoin. However, it did not have immediate plans to launch one. The arrival of Fidelity into stablecoins will likely bring more trust, attention, and skills to the stablecoin‚ÄÇecosystem. However, it could also invite tougher scrutiny from regulators and raise concerns about fairness or the likelihood that a handful of large‚ÄÇplayers could dominate the market . Some people believe Fidelity‚Äôs new stablecoin will help provide safer, more reliable digital payment options. However, critics say it could create problems with oversight, limit competition, and concentrate too much power in the hands of a few large firms. How does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin help innovation? Reports indicate that Fidelity has a pilot program for a stablecoin backed by the US dollar to make faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments and settlements than traditional methods. The company wants to build a bridge between old and new finance, and its investment shows that trusted, well-established financial institutions see stablecoins as a serious and credible part of the future financial system. Some crypto experts suggest Fidelity‚Äôs move will push banks, payment providers, and fintech companies to adopt blockchain technology faster and improve their services due to the growing competition. Blockchain experts also pointed out the success of Fidelity‚Äôs early pilot programs, saying the trials show promising results that could fuel optimism among other big players and make digital financial systems more accessible for everyone. What risks come with Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin? Some critics say unclear rules for digital currencies make it hard for investors, companies, and regulators to know what‚Äôs fair or how to keep the market safe. Others, though, fear that large firms like Fidelity will crowd out small start-ups and prevent these new and innovative businesses from getting a fair shot at competition and that the end result will be less fresh ideas and new competition. Some people fear that if just a handful of big companies dominate most stablecoins, it could risk the entire financial system if any one of them encounters trouble. They also worry about whether these companies will be truthful when they claim to manage their reserves responsibly and to keep users safe. Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative is part of a larger trend where many traditional banks and fintech companies actively develop their own stablecoins or explore blockchain technology to improve payment systems and financial services. Those advantages have attracted the attention of political leaders and regulators who agree there is an opportunity for the industry to expand and offer benefits to more people but have also sought to create clear rules to remove the risks associated with these tokens and to shield consumers from potential harm. Some crypto projects are concerned that large finance companies like Fidelity will use their vast amounts of resources to take over a large part of the crypto space and discourage new innovations from startups, which beats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. As a result, there is a growing push and pull between industry experts who want regulators to create soft laws that will help the crypto industry grow by making it fair for small companies to compete with large firms and those who want strict rules that will protect everyone from the dominance of large financial institutions. What does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin mean for the future? People and financial firms that have doubts about cryptocurrencies will get a positive perspective about investing in digital currency when they see Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative succeed. Big banks and fintech companies will also be motivated to develop their own stablecoins or develop new blockchain solutions to help make digital finance accessible to a wider audience. We still can‚Äôt ignore the risks involved because it is possible that large firms like Fidelity might try to dominate the crypto market once they see the company succeed. This means they will have more influence on whether they are worthy of joining the crypto space, which would make it difficult for smaller firms to compete. The current laws around cryptocurrency also don‚Äôt fully address the problems big companies bring when they introduce their own coins. This is because these firms must follow heavy compliance requirements and need tight supervision that smaller companies will struggle to keep up with. The success or failure of Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin will likely shape the future of both traditional finance and the crypto world, influencing how open, fair, and innovative this industry can become.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025.

From a technical analysis perspective, Ether‚Äôs price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank, which handles the Fed‚Äôs bond transactions, just disclosed the losses, linking them to the central bank‚Äôs tight monetary stance.

2025-06-07T00:00:51,"Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That‚Äôs Forming","After days of fluctuating around the $105,000 range, Bitcoin appears to be succumbing to pressure from bears and profit-taking from traders. The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head‚Äôs peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH.

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X.

Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions‚Äîparticularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump‚Äîinjecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs.

Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target ‚Äì Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher. However, failure to reclaim the moving averages may signal exhaustion and expose the price to another retest of the $100K psychological level.

2025-06-06T22:36:18,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June ‚Äì Bitcoin, Solana, XRP","Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins ‚ÄîPepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them‚Äîhave each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let‚Äôs explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World‚Äôs Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world‚Äôs biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto‚Äôs flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto‚Äôs future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto‚Äôs $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL‚Äôs appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76‚Äîup 1% in the last 24 hours‚Äîmirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple‚Äôs Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple‚Äôs XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP‚Äôs retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure.

Investors gain access to a members-only ecosystem that includes exclusive content, early access features, and various perks. Staking options are also available through the SUBBD platform, offering a fixed annual return of 20%‚Äîa compelling incentive for early backers.
