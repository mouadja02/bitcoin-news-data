2025-06-07T15:45:51,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $105,000 As Markets Recover","Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $105,000, making a strong recovery after dropping to an intraday low of $101,201 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2%, trading around the $105,071 mark. BTC’s drop to $100,000 wiped out over $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours as traders rushed to sell. Analysts believe BTC’s decline has been sustained by long-term holders locking in their profits. Bitcoin (BTC) Turns Bearish Amid Political Tensions Bitcoin (BTC) dipped sharply on Friday, plunging 3% to hit a low of $100,421 as political tensions between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk escalated. However, it has recovered since, regaining its position above $105,000. The price action reflects increased volatility across crypto after an acrimonious escalation of tensions between President Trump and Musk. The tensions triggered a risk-off sentiment heading into the weekend as the global crypto market cap plunged over 4%, and Bitcoin fell to $100,000, with market watchers sweating over a further decline. According to data from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, the Binance net taker volume fell from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours, indicating a sharp change in investor sentiment. The analyst emphasized that this was the largest intraday net-taker volume reversal observed on the exchange this year. The shift shows how quickly sentiment changes if influential figures or macro-narratives dominate headlines. Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action Bitcoin has recovered after Thursday’s dip, rising back above $105,000 during the ongoing session. While BTC has recovered, the broader crypto market is still digesting the fallout. However, CryptoQuant analysts have pointed out another factor that could decide the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the amount of BTC transferred to exchanges. Miner-to-exchange inflows crossed $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. These inflows are often seen as a proxy for miners’ preparing to sell their holdings. This could significantly impact BTC’s short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to the flagship cryptocurrency’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. “Paying close attention to these inflows—especially during historical peaks like the current phase—can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Thursday, falling to an intraday low of $100,421 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. Sentiment turned bearish following an ugly spat between President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. However, the decline was short-lived as BTC rebounded on Friday to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,378. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but has declined and is currently trading around $104,799. Despite the decline, analysts believe a pullback was expected and could trigger a move to fresh all-time highs. According to an analysis, BTC follows a similar path after each halving. The analyst pointed out that BTC rose around 280% a year after the 2016 halving and 550% a year after the 2020 halving. During the current cycle, BTC has climbed around 70% since the halving. According to Klarch, price action has picked up after a slow start during previous cycles, indicating there is more room for growth. According to the analyst, BTC’s recent all-time high is a milestone that marks the beginning of a move higher. BTC has multiple tops before it hits the cycle’s real peak. BTC started the previous week positively but was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The price declined on Friday, dropping 1.51% to go below $105,000 and settle at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775.

Price action turned bearish on Tuesday as BTC fell 0.44% to $105,435. The price declined on Wednesday, falling nearly 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,755. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday thanks to the Trump-Musk spat. As a result, BTC fell over 3%, plunging to an intraday low of $100,421 before settling at $101,615.

2025-06-07T15:38:35,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-7: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, Ripple: XRP","The crypto market registered a sharp recovery on Friday after Thursday’s sudden drop. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,811 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. However, the decline was short-lived as the price rebounded on Friday to erase most of the previous day’s losses and settle above $104,378. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1%, trading at around $105,128. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has struggled after Thursday’s decline, which saw the price dip below $2,400. However, it has struggled to regain momentum and has registered only a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 2%, trading around $151. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 6%, and Cardano (ADA) is up over 3%, trading around $0.668. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable increases. Gemini Confidentially Files for US IPO Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss brothers, has disclosed it confidentially filed for an IPO as crypto exchanges attempt to take advantage of renewed market momentum. Several high-profile companies, including crypto exchanges, have launched successful listings, indicating growing demand and renewed vigor in the capital markets. Recently, USDC issuer Circle went public, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital, stated, “Pre-IPO crypto companies would be crazy not to move ahead with listings after seeing how Circle traded. Crypto can be an unpredictable market, so when you get a chance like this, you take it.” The recent spate of IPOs heralds a turning point for the industry, reflecting growing confidence among digital asset firms to attract mainstream investors. It also suggests companies are confident about meeting transparency, regulatory, and capital requirements. Gemini has not determined the size or the proposed range for its offering. Kat Liu, vice president at IPOX stated, “Gemini's move contributes to the broader momentum and reinforces the idea that crypto-native firms are increasingly preparing to access public markets. More broadly, this signals that long-anticipated firms are now ready to reengage with public capital.” Singapore’s Ousted Crypto Firms Have Nowhere To Go Singapore recently passed an order prohibiting unlicensed crypto firms from serving overseas customers. The order marks the beginning of the end for regulatory loopholes in the blockchain industry. The directive, issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, orders crypto firms offering services abroad to get licensed or leave. The movie aligns with a broader global push for compliance and cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing. Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Blockchain Alliance, stated, “For exchanges still playing regulatory pinball — constantly seeking loopholes to avoid licensing requirements — the reality is clear: They will soon find themselves having to relocate to their favorite destination, the moon. With jurisdictions like Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, Hong Kong, and others tightening oversight and closing gaps, there’s simply no escaping the global push for compliance.” Some in the crypto space have interpreted the recent order as a sharp policy reversal. However, the regular said it has always maintained a steady stance. Singapore’s Central Bank stated, “MAS’ position on this has been consistently communicated for a few years since the first response to public consultation issued on February 14, 2022, and in subsequent publications on October 4, 2024, and May 302025.” Dow Jones Rises On Back Of Strong Market Data Wall Street ended the week positively after better-than-expected job numbers boosted investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443 points, leading Friday’s gains among major indices. The S&P 500 rose 1.03% to close above 6000 for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2% thanks to a major rebound in tech stocks. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US added 139,000 jobs in May, above the expected 125,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, while the wage growth also came in higher than expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from Thursday’s dramatic decline to register an increase of nearly 3% on Friday and recoup a significant chunk of the previous day’s losses. The flagship cryptocurrency has extended its gains in the current session and has reclaimed $105,000 to trade around $105,150. Analysts believe miner activity could impact BTC’s near-term outlook. According to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, miners have increased the volume of BTC transferred to crypto exchanges. According to the analysis, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. Analysts view such inflows as a proxy for miners intending to sell their assets. This could impact short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to BTC’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes.

The current session sees BTC up 0.91%, having reclaimed $105,000, trading around $105,325. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a sharp drop on Thursday, losing momentum and plunging below $2,400 to a low of $2,392. While it has recovered, ETH is struggling to push back to pre-Thursday levels and is hovering around $2,500. ETH’s muted price action comes despite spot Ethereum ETFs recording positive inflows. ETH ETFs recorded $25.2 million in net inflows on June 6th marking 15 consecutive days of positive inflows. US-based spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted a combined $281 million in inflows over the past week. Despite positive inflows, ETH has been unable to cross $2,700, a level where it faces substantial resistance. ETH started the previous week positively, rising 0.49% on Monday.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has made a strong recovery after dropping to a low of $141 on Thursday. The altcoin has reclaimed the $150 price level, with buyers looking to maintain momentum and push towards $160. However, Solana DEX volumes have been falling for four weeks, and a return of bearish sentiment could see the price drop towards $100, breaking its current bullish structure. SOL started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline before recovering on Tuesday and settling at $176. Buyers lost momentum on Wednesday as the price fell 2.55%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $172.

2025-06-07T15:35:50,"Outset PR Reports LATAM Crypto Media Reach Becoming Centralized in Q1 2025 as 73% of Outlets Lost Traffic","In the first quarter of 2025, Latin America’s crypto media ecosystem had one of its roughest stretches in recent memory. New research from Outset PR, an agency known for its data-driven, boutique approach to PR in Web3 , shows that 73% of active crypto news outlets in the region saw traffic decline in Q1 2025. Just six crypto-native publications accounted for 69% of total traffic across the crypto-only segment. The report — based on SimilarWeb data from 55 tracked LATAM media sites — paints a stark picture of media contraction. Once-reliable names lost ground, some disappearing from the radar altogether. Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s January rally and early-year bullish momentum didn’t translate into sustained audience growth. Instead, a mix of macro headwinds, market corrections, and Google’s March algorithm update created a perfect storm, hitting crypto-focused sites hardest — especially those lacking strong SEO strategies or diversified content models. Media Instability Escalates Amid Market Turmoil In January 2025, Bitcoin briefly surged past $109,000, fueled by institutional inflows and broader optimism around U.S. economic policy. But the rally proved short-lived. By February, a wave of exploit-driven panic, meme coin collapses, and shaky sentiment pulled the market into a sharp correction. The downturn hit the media landscape just as hard. Advertising budgets contracted, user interest waned, and Google’s March 2025 algorithm update wiped visibility from many LATAM-focused crypto outlets — especially those relying on outdated SEO tactics or thin content. According to Outset PR’s tracking , 21.8% of the 55 monitored outlets gained traffic in February, while a staggering 78.18% saw declines. Performance snapshot of LATAM crypto outlets in February 2025, as reported by Outset PR Google’s March Update Creates a Visible Divide March brought more instability — both in markets and media. Bitcoin spent most of the month fluctuating between $83,000 and $94,000, with modest rebounds tied to renewed institutional interest and broader macro optimism. Amid price swings, crypto readers turned to the media for clarity. But just as visibility was needed most, Google’s March core algorithm update reshaped how regional publishers ranked in search. The update hit LATAM outlets unevenly. According to Outset PR, 24 of 55 active crypto-focused sites regained some traffic by the end of March. But most remained below their January baselines. Outset PR data showing March 2025 traffic trends for LATAM crypto media A sharp divide emerged: agile players optimized quickly and adapted, while others continued their downward spiral. Notably, CryptoNews Brasil went offline entirely for Brazilian users , likely due to government-imposed access restrictions tied to new regulations targeting offshore betting platforms. The site remains accessible in Europe, but its LATAM visibility has vanished. Finance News Sites Outrank Crypto-Native Brands in Traffic, But Offer Limited Crypto Depth According to the report, all the top Latin American media sites with crypto coverage are web portals for finance and general news. They regularly got millions of visits but mentioned crypto mostly during periods when it was on an uptrend — losing interest when the hype died down. The bulk of these platforms operate in Brazil and Argentina , and they make many content choices based on trends in their countries' politics and economies. Therefore, their reports about crypto can be inconsistent. Though macro trends may bring exposure for crypto-based content on these general sites, they typically do not provide the ongoing and meaningful connection that crypto-native platforms can. Six Crypto-Native Outlets Dominate LATAM Visibility A key insight from Outset PR’s Q1 report is the extreme concentration of visibility in the region. Despite the vast number of sites tracked, just six publications accounted for 69.13% of total crypto-native traffic. Q1 2025 media tier segmentation for LATAM crypto outlets, sourced from Outset PR Together, these six outlets drew 4.11 million visits across the quarter. They were the only crypto-native sites to consistently surpass the 400,000 monthly average visits. Their dominance highlights the narrowing field of reliable crypto voices in LATAM, especially as newer or mid-sized players struggle with traffic volatility and indexing issues. The next tier captured traffic in the 130K–270K range. While still influential, these outlets represent a sharp drop in reach. Most fall short of driving large-scale visibility for crypto projects without additional amplification. Beneath this, Outset PR categorized the remaining outlets as long-tail players. Fourteen of them attracted fewer than 10,000 monthly visits. Though potentially useful for SEO or niche audiences, these sites now contribute minimal impact in terms of direct reach. Strategic Takeaways for LATAM Crypto Media Both the size and influence of Latin America’s crypto media landscape are shrinking — and consolidating. What once felt like a sprawling ecosystem is now concentrated in the hands of a few players. Outset PR’s report underscores how quickly visibility can shift. In fast-moving markets like LATAM, media influence doesn’t erode gradually — it can collapse in a matter of weeks. And influence today is about how often an outlet gets indexed, how visible it is in algorithm-driven feeds, whether its audience is real, and how quickly it publishes. The full version of this report — including all names, numbers, patterns, and charts — is available on Outset PR’s official blog .

2025-06-07T15:15:06,"$31M Bitcoin Donation to Ross Ulbricht Traced to AlphaBay, Not Silk Road","Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace who was granted clemency by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, received a whopping $31 million Bitcoin donation from an anonymous wallet over the previous weekend. The sizable gift, sent less than five months after Ulbricht’s sentence was commuted, immediately sparked speculation that he had covertly reclaimed old Silk Road earnings. Anonymous Bitcoin Gift to Ross Ulbricht According to the intel shared by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis with WIRED, the 300 BTC donation did not originate from Silk Road at all. Instead, the funds appear to trace back to AlphaBay, a now-defunct darknet market that operated between 2014 and 2017, well after Silk Road’s takedown. AlphaBay, which was reportedly ten times the size of Silk Road at its peak, was known for trafficking in drugs, malware, and illegal services. Phil Larratt, Chainalysis’s director of investigations and a former UK law enforcement official, said there are “reasonable grounds to suspect” the Bitcoin came from someone involved with AlphaBay – likely a former vendor, given the size of the amount. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who had earlier examined the donation, also concluded the funds did not come from Silk Road. Despite the sender’s use of Bitcoin mixing services, ZachXBT traced the BTC to a wallet previously flagged by Chainalysis as connected to illicit activity. He shared his conclusion with WIRED, wherein he noted that the donation itself may be genuine, but “not legitimate funds.” Additional clues suggest the person behind the transfer may have been actively trying to avoid detection: ZachXBT discovered the same individual had previously cashed out other crypto through centralized exchanges in small, spread-out amounts, rather than large single transactions. This behavior is consistent with an effort to evade asset freezing or scrutiny. AlphaBay Crackdown Chainalysis reportedly declined to share specifics on how exactly it linked the donation to AlphaBay. But it is important to note that the firm is widely known for its expertise in mapping illicit activity across blockchain networks and played a crucial role in dismantling the now-defunct marketplace during the multinational law enforcement initiative known as Operation Bayonet, involving the FBI, DEA, and Europol. The crackdown later led to the conviction of Bryan Connor Herrell, an AlphaBay moderator, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison. As for Ulbricht, he has not publicly addressed the donation.

2025-06-07T15:12:00,"Netflix’s ‘House of Streams’ to Award 1 Bitcoin to Winning Streamer","Key Takeaways: Netflix’s new reality show House of Streams will award 1 Bitcoin to the winning streamer. The series aims to push creative boundaries by offering a crypto prize instead of cash. The show launches amid rising security risks for crypto holders, with several high-profile kidnapping attempts reported this year. Netflix’s latest reality venture, House of Streams, is set to debut on June 18 in the UK and Ireland, offering a unique prize, 1 Bitcoin, to the winning contestant. The show will feature eight online streamers with a combined following of four million. According to the official website, the participants, many of whom are well-known on Twitch, will compete in a series of challenges for a chance to take home the Bitcoin, valued at over $104,000 at press time. Why Did Netflix’s New Series Choose Bitcoin Over Cash? While the production is backed by the Malta Film Commission, it remains unclear why the series opted for a crypto prize over traditional rewards. Creator Mark Holland reportedly said the prize “couldn’t have been a simple cash prize or a trip to the Maldives,” hinting at an intent to push boundaries. The show’s producers have also cautioned against scams. A statement released on May 22 clarified, “We support Bitcoin and no other memecoin,” after reports emerged of individuals attempting to launch fraudulent tokens under the show’s name.

Playing for Bitcoin just hits different! pic.twitter.com/x44Dwey3Pf — Manana Samuseva NYC (@MananaSamuseva) June 6, 2025 Netflix is no stranger to crypto-themed content. The streaming giant previously released Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King, covering the QuadrigaCX collapse, and recently greenlit The Altruists, a series focusing on the lives of ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and former Alameda Research head Caroline Ellison. So far, the contestants — who include streamers such as The Black Hokage, CyborgAngel, and OutplayedByJade — have yet to comment publicly on their participation. Netflix’s Crypto Show Launches as Security Risks for Holders Rise The show comes amid growing concerns over the risks faced by crypto holders. In May 2024, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was rescued from captivity after French police stormed a suburban Paris location. The suspects had severed one of the victim’s fingers , echoing earlier high-profile attacks involving physical mutilation and digital wallets. Last month, Pierre Noizat, founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, saw his own family targeted. A group of masked men attempted to abduct Noizat’s daughter and grandson in broad daylight. The assault was foiled when the victims and a bystander managed to fight off the attackers. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir. Ils tentaient de l'enlever. Un homme a surgi, extincteur à la main, pour les faire fuir. → https://t.co/P0qV6PR40v pic.twitter.com/9f4r2Gi7ho — Le Figaro (@Le_Figaro) May 13, 2025 More recently, three teenagers were accused of kidnapping a man at gunpoint after he returned from hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas. After returning to his apartment, the victim was ambushed at gunpoint by three teenagers from Florida. The assailants forced him into their vehicle, covered his head with a towel, and warned him not to look at them. They drove him over 70 miles to a remote desert near White Hills, Arizona. These incidents have intensified calls for better protection for those tied to the crypto world, particularly as rising asset values make high-profile figures more attractive targets.

2025-06-07T14:50:55,"Garantex Moves $15M Despite Tether Freeze, Data Shows","Despite a widely publicized asset freeze by Tether and coordinated sanctions across the world, Russian crypto exchange Garantex has managed to transfer millions of digital assets on the blockchain — demonstrating acute loopholes in the efficacy of crypto blacklists and asset-freezing regimes. According to a recent news report by blockchain forensics firm Glass Ledger, over $15 million worth of reserves linked to Garantex has been actively transferred since March, staying off blacklists by hopping between chains, using mixers like Tornado Cash, and exploiting successor platforms like Grinex. The drama began early in March, when US, German, and Finnish regulators froze $27 million of USDT held by Garantex as part of a sweeping crackdown on the sanctioned exchange. Tether's freeze, which was implemented at the smart contract level, was hailed as a crypto compliance milestone, with regulators trumpeting it as proof that digital assets can be made subject to on-chain blacklists. Garantex, in turn, directly accused Tether of ”declaring war on the Russian crypto market” and shut down temporarily, but first threatened customers it had ”solutions” for individuals with BTC and ETH. How Garantex Funds Kept Moving Later on-chain information revealed that the freeze was only the tip of the iceberg of a new cat-and-mouse game. One of the long-dormant Garantex Ethereum wallets that first raised the eyebrows of compliance experts was revived in March and collected over 3,200 ETH before it flowed $2.3 million through Tornado Cash, a highly respected decentralized mixer used to launder dirty money. The same wallet now holds $6.1 million worth of ETH, while other funds are moved on the Bitcoin and BNB blockchain. Notably, 2.2 BTC was bridged to Tron and partially sent to Grinex, which is the platform commonly regarded as Garantex's operational successor. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun summed up the dilemma: ”The Garantex case bursts the bubble of control so many still carry. $15 million freely available through dark chains and mixers is not a breakdown of law — it's a breakdown of sanction enforcement.” Their latest report details how Garantex exploited the delay between freeze statements and enforcement as well as the inherent limitations of blacklists in the multi-chain universe. The investigative trail doesn't end there. Grinex, now suspected of appropriating Garantex's infrastructure and base of customers, has moved over $1.6 billion on international exchanges in just a few weeks, according to our reporting at Global Ledger. Some of these flows directly or with intermediate hops to major regulated exchanges — raising the red flags of compliance and highlighting the danger even for platforms that have KYC and AML guidelines set up. In one case, $191,000 of USDT was sent directly from a wallet linked to Grinex to a top global exchange, and another $500,000 transfer ended up at an EU VASP in just a single intermediary wallet. What's behind these transactions? Forensic analysts pinpoint several factors: blacklist-based freezing's limitations, delays in operations in Tether's multi-signature freeze mechanism (up to 44 minutes at times, long enough for bad guys to execute withdrawals prior to the freeze taking effect), and Garantex's tactic of hot wallet rotation, use of less-regulated blockchains, and use of cross-chain bridges in order to remain one step ahead of enforcement mechanisms. Besides, Garantex's operating trends changed rapidly following sanctions: they changed address clustering, rerouted transactions to Asian exchanges like HTX and OKX, and began rotating hot wallets more frequently — daily sometimes to evade detection. Compliance Challenges and Industry Response Compliance experts now insist that exchanges go beyond the simple blacklist screening. ”You require real-time blockchain analytics, behavioral risk scoring, and active transaction monitoring,” a leading AML consultant said. ”Otherwise, sanctioned players will always find a way through.” Exchanges are also requested to strengthen onboarding due diligence, flag high-risk flows from known mixers or successor entities, and cooperate with forensics firms for timely identification. The Garantex case has once more fueled controversy surrounding the utilization of decentralized cross-chain bridges and mixers in enabling illicit finance. Although some suspect that mixers have a valid purpose for privacy, their adoption by criminals and sanctioned entities is currently surpassing the industry's ability to freeze and monitor assets, critics argue. The appearance of services such as Grinex, essentially a rebranded Garantex, demonstrates how quickly criminals can adapt, bringing technology and userbases along with them in order to evade enforcement.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9479/garantex-moves-15-m-despite-tether-freeze-data-shows,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT","News|Security",cryptocompare

The Treasury says the $10 billion operation is designed to repurchase securities maturing between July 15th, 2025 and May 31st, 2027. Buybacks allow the Treasury to retire outstanding debt early, potentially reducing interest costs and adjusting its debt profile. This big buyback comes as rising yields increase borrowing costs, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continuing to keep interest rates higher-for-longer. In an April interview with Bloomberg , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about foreign nations fueling a bond market selloff, pointing instead to investors unwinding leveraged positions. At the same time, Bessent specifically called out the Treasury’s ability to increase its buyback program if necessary. When asked whether he’s discussing concerns about the stability of the Treasury market with Powell, Bessent dismissed the notion that there’s any cause for alarm. “Specifically, did we discuss some kind of a break the glass? I think we’re a long way from that.” Historical records indicate the Treasury’s previous largest buyback happened in 2000, at approximately $3 billion.

2025-06-07T14:30:01,"Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says","According to social media buzz, the growing clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the crypto world. Musk’s public swipe at a recent spending bill kicked things off. Then came Trump’s warning to yank Musk’s government contracts. It got messy fast. And now, some believe XRP could come out on top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Elon Musk-Trump Feud Spurs Crypto Talk Musk took to Twitter on June 4 to slam what he called reckless government spending. His post warned of “serious economic risks.” Not long after, Trump fired back. He threatened to pull subsidies and contracts tied to Tesla. That response sent Tesla’s stock tumbling. Investors watched $150 billion in market value vanish in a matter of hours. Market Moves And Price Swings Based on reports, Bitcoin slid more than 5% following the news. It dropped to a low of $100,550 before finding a bit of footing near $102,400. XRP wasn’t spared either. It fell alongside other major coins, though the exact drop varied across exchanges. Traders saw quick declines, then a modest rebound as the dust settled. I believe @elonmusk will do anything to make @Ripple $XRP as a chosen one and use it on @x while knowing that @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and @realDonaldTrump will watch @worldlibertyfi and @bitcoin crashing in front of their eyes. Right, @elonmusk? — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) June 5, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Joshua Dalton, who founded tech services firm TRIBLU, stirred the pot with a bold claim. He suggested Musk might choose XRP as the main currency for X’s upcoming payment system, X Money. Dalton argued that Musk “will do anything” to make XRP the go-to token. He tagged Ripple, Musk, US President Trump, and Trump’s sons in a single post. That move framed the drama as more than just politics—it became a showdown of crypto loyalties. Technical Fit For X Money XRP provides quicker settlement and reduced fees than Bitcoin. In 2021, Musk suspended BTC payments for Tesla due to high energy consumption and centralized mining concerns. That move proved he’s not afraid to change course when a coin isn’t aligned with his objectives. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger In October 2024, Musk even referenced XRP in a viral video. He spoke of crypto like XRP potentially resisting central control, but he did not go so far as to make a full endorsement. With X Money scheduled to roll out later in 2025, XRP’s architecture for cross-border transfers could mirror what Musk is looking to create. Some analysts point out real hurdles. Ripple still holds a large chunk of XRP, and US regulators are watching closely. Any big move would need legal green lights and deep liquidity on exchanges. But for now, the idea of an “everything app” powered by XRP keeps popping up in crypto chats.

This boom reveals growing hope that the US SEC will approve an XRP ETF by 2025. Applications filed by major asset managers add pressure on a decision-making process. As institutional interest grows, traders are noticing new presale altcoins. Discover why these events are important for the XRP ecosystem as well as the best substitute for XRP that draws in investors below. Source: fxstreet.com XRP ETF Approval Odds Soars Past 92% The likelihood of a US SEC allowing a spot XRP ETF has increased to 93% over the last month. Data from Polymarket indicates that since early May, approval chances have risen by 20%. Several big asset managers have given things more impetus. Bitwise, applications have been sent in by Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary Capital. Every lawsuit strains the SEC to act swiftly. Source: Kenny Nguyen on X Additionally, the recent XRP futures ETF launches by CME Group and Coinbase Derivatives have been helpful. Mid-May saw both products go live with notable institutional appetite and trading volume. This is evidence, according to analysts, that markets are ready for more controlled XRP products. Legal developments around Ripple also matter. The continuous settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped to reduce ambiguity. Although a definitive agreement is not yet in place, recent court decisions and regulatory signals point to XRP possibly not being considered a security. This legal clarity has changed investor mood and raised approval chances. Now with odds above 92%, insiders see a likely SEC nod for an XRP ETF. Many anticipate a surge in inflows akin to past Bitcoin ETF releases should approval come about. This can inspire greater acceptance and direct fresh capital into XRP investment platforms. Although analysts are still wary about timing, the general agreement is that: The year 2025 looks to be the one for a spot XRP ETF. $300M Strategic XRP Reserve Submitted to SEC Seeking $300 million for an XRP-focused Treasury, Webus International Limited registered a Form 6-K with the SEC. Signing a joint venture with Samara Alpha Management, the Hangzhou-based company established a crypto reserve for payments made using Ripple. For its booking system and chauffeur services, Webus intends to handle quick cross-border payments with XRP. This action conforms to the strategy of renewable energy company VivoPower to create a $121 million XRP reserve and BitGo’s validation of a $100 million initial investment. From the futures market, where Coinbase Derivatives and CME Group debuted XRP futures ETFs in May, institutional curiosity in XRP has extended. Analysts from U.Today point out this trend as a major indicator that large corporations value diversifying outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Remittix: The New XRP Replacing XRP as the Best PayFi System Remittix (RTX) —-a presale crypto on Ethereum–might take front stage as the best PayFi option over XRP. Remittix allows anyone to send crypto and get local money in more than 30 countries without additional charges unlike XRP. Close to $15.5 million has been raised thus far from Remittix’s token presale; analysts estimate a 50x increase when the network opens. Although XRP ETFs show promise, Remittix could be quite helpful for regular payments and company use. Apart from its great use, Remittix has a low entrance point at $0.0781, hence its ROI is higher than XRP. Remittix is also expected to strike exchanges shortly, hence its price is about to soar violently. Final Words Anticipation is at an all-time high as XRP ETF odds exceed 92% and Webus’s $300 million reserve plan formalizes XRP’s part in payments. Still, Remittix is one improvement on XRP ETF products. Remittix provides low fees, PayFi tools, and simple local cash conversion. Remittix might be a better and more useful tool for traders and companies than conventional XRP approaches. Keep an eye on Remittix if you wish to keep ahead since it seeks to surpass XRP ETF in crypto-to- fiat payment systems.

This time, it’s a musician who made $3M selling NFTs, only to see the gains disappear thanks to taxes and a market crash. Meanwhile, meme coins keep spiking and crashing like a rollercoaster with no seatbelts. But not everyone wants to gamble with their life savings. Some investors are tired of chasing hype and are now looking for the best altcoins that actually do something useful – or at least have a shot at lasting beyond the next TikTok trend. Let’s talk about three new crypto projects that offer a smarter bet in 2025. These aren’t just meme machines. They’re platforms with purpose, backed by strong presale numbers and real potential. When the Music Stops, so Does the Money Crypto fame can be fleeting – and expensive. Just ask musician Jonathan Mann, who made headlines after selling $3M worth of NFTs through his ‘Song a Day’ project. But when tax season rolled around, Mann owed the IRS more than he could pay. Combined with a brutal crypto crash, it wiped out his earnings. His story has quickly become a cautionary tale – a harsh reminder of what can happen when profits aren’t protected and taxes come calling. For anyone chasing short-term gains in a wildly volatile market, it’s a wake-up call. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – From Meme to Machine: Trading Power at Your Fingertips In a market where fortunes can vanish overnight – Snorter Token ($SNORT) offers something rare: meme-level fun with real utility. Built on Solana, Snorter Token is a fast and secure Telegram-based trading bot that gives retail traders pro-level tools to navigate chaotic token launches. It automates swaps, snipes, stop-losses, and portfolio tracking – all inside Telegram. Trades are routed through custom RPCs for lightning execution and MEV-resistant relayers that flag scams before you touch them. Powered by the $SNORT token, users unlock perks like reduced fees (as low as 0.85%), staking rewards up to 823% APY, and access to premium bot features. The bot already supports Solana, with Ethereum and other chains on the way. Right now, you can buy $SNORT for just $0.0945 and it has already raised over $566K in the presale phase. Unlike joke coins that vanish when the music stops, Snorter’s got a real engine under the hood – and a meme-snorting aardvark leading the charge. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Turning Bitcoin from Slow Store to Superhighway Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver sub-second speeds and near-zero fees. It turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active blockchain for payments, dApps, DeFi, and meme coins. With cross-chain support from day one, Bitcoin Hyper makes fast, cheap, and scalable Bitcoin-based transactions finally possible – without compromise. Right now, $HYPER is priced at $0.0118, with over $670K raised in the presale. Price forecasts put it between $0.15 – $0.32 in 2025. That’s up to 2,610% growth. Add 20% APY staking and the math gets wild. Let’s say you buy 10K $HYPER for $118 today and stake for a year. You’d earn 2K extra tokens, totaling 12K $HYPER. At the current price, that’s $141.60. But at $0.32? That’s $3,840 – from just $118. And this isn’t just hype. Bitcoin Hyper is building on Solana tech, with plans to roll out full support for Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon soon. It’s built for builders, degens, and actual payments – not just HODLers. 3. Fluxbot ($FLUXB) – The Telegram Trading Bot Empowering Retail Investors In the volatile world of crypto, where fortunes can vanish overnight, Fluxbot ($FLUXB) offers a toolset designed to help retail investors navigate the market with greater confidence and efficiency.

2025-06-07T13:30:59,"Bitcoin at Crossroads Amid Increased Selling Pressure, Warns Analytics Platform Glassnode – Here’s the Firm’s Outlook","Analytics platform Glassnode is outlining the possible path ahead for Bitcoin ( BTC ) amid a period of intense profit-taking. According to the analytics platform, Bitcoin is facing growing resistance after reaching a new all-time high last month. The resistance can be attributed to exhaustion from profit-taking by long-time Bitcoin holders and exhaustion from buyers who purchased earlier, according to Glassnode. Over the short term, the intensifying profit-taking could point to a distribution phase and not a fresh breakout. “Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.” Glassnode says the market is experiencing the fifth major profit-taking wave in the current cycle, with the realized profits per day having risen to $1.47 billion. “ The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25,000 – $31,000 and $60,000 – $73,000. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.” The continued selling pressure from long-term holders is raising the risk of a short-term correction, according to the analytics platform. The first on-chain support zone for Bitcoin, according to Glassnode, is around $103,700, while the second one is at around the $95,600 price. If the latter is breached, Glassnode says it could be a confirmation of a potential “broader risk reset.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,007 at time of writing.

2025-06-07T13:30:00,"State of Crypto: How Crypto Legislation Is Advancing","The House Financial Services Committee might mark up market structure legislation next week, while the Senate seems close to passing its stablecoin bill. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Legislative moves The narrative Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not. Why it matters The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen. Breaking it down Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely). On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House. ""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for."" In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago). Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then. One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued. The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer — perhaps through the end of the year. This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

2025-06-07T13:24:17,"Ether ETFs Near $1 Billion Milestone After Third Week of Inflows","U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have now marked their third consecutive week of inflows , with recent data pointing to growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed products. According to data from Farside Investors, the funds recorded $25.3 million in inflows on June 6 alone, bringing the current 15-day inflow streak—dating back to May 16—to a total of $837.5 million. This persistent trend represents nearly 25% of the total $3.32 billion in net inflows since spot Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If the momentum continues into the upcoming week, analysts predict the current streak could easily cross the $1 billion threshold. Ether ETFs Outshines Bitcoin as Flows Diverge While Ether ETFs continue their strong run, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a dip in investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF inflows broke their previous streak on May 29, followed by a sharp outflow of $346.8 million. Since then, the flows have been volatile, contrasting Ether’s more consistent capital movement. During this period, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin in price growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged by over 31% in the past month, now trading at $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Some market analysts believe this momentum may be sustained through the current cycle. Technical analyst Crypto Eagles noted that Ether appears to be mimicking historical cycles, particularly the 2020–2021 bull run. If this pattern continues, Ether could be on track to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Analysts Push for Staking Features in ETFs Despite the promising trend, some industry experts argue that Ether ETFs still have room to evolve. One key area of improvement is the inclusion of staking features. Allowing investors to earn rewards from Ether staking directly through ETFs could improve both fund performance and investor appeal. On May 31, ETF provider REX Shares filed to launch the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs in the U.S. Although a launch date is yet to be confirmed, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that REX used “regulatory workarounds” to bring these products closer to market. As institutional interest strengthens and new innovations emerge, Ether ETFs could play a growing role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets.

2025-06-07T13:18:05,"Pepe croaks as whale exodus deepens and buyers flinch","Pepe coin price retreated this week as whales continued selling and the crypto market sell-off intensified. Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-biggest meme coin on Ethereum ( ETH ), plunged to a low of $0.00001043, down by 36% from its highest point in May. This decline happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most meme coins plunged because of profit-taking and geopolitical issues. Pepe’s crash also happened as whales continued exiting their positions, signaling that they expected the downtrend to continue. The supply held by whales has dropped to 137.4 trillion, down from the year-to-date high of 166 trillion. Their holdings have fallen to the lowest point since November last year. The Network Realized Profit/Loss metric has plunged into the negative zone, a sign that some sellers are exiting at a loss. More on-chain data shows that active addresses have slumped to less than 3,000. Pepe on-chain metrics | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, Pepe has become cheap, which may push investors to buy the dip. The closely-watched MVRV ratio with the Z score has dropped to minus 0.192. You might also like: Hyperliquid coin forms bullish pennant as momentum builds: is a breakout imminent? A negative MVRV ratio means that a coin’s market value has moved below the average price at which holders acquired their coins. It often signals that a coin is in a buy zone. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe token price has decreased from last month’s high of $0.00001622 to $0.000011 today. It is consolidating at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Pepe’s price has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.00001622 and the lower side at $0.0000052. The recent dip is likely part of the formation of the handle section of the C&H pattern. Therefore, if this pattern works out, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the all-time high of $0.00002712, about 135% above the current level. This view will be confirmed if it rises above the cup’s upper side at $0.00001622.

2025-06-07T13:05:00,"Here’s why Bitcoin and altcoins like Pepe, Casper, Huma Finance are rising","Bitcoin and most altcoins rose slightly on Saturday, erasing some of the losses made during the week. BTC price rose to $105,000, up from this month’s low of $100,300, while the market cap of all coins jumped to $3.4 trillion. Pepe, the second-biggest meme coin on Ethereum, jumped to $0.00001150, up from this week’s low of $0.00001040. Similarly, Casper Network (CSPR) jumped to $0.0145, up by 32% from its lowest point this week. Huma Finance (HUMA) soared for three consecutive days, reaching a high of $0.055. Why Bitcoin and altcoins re rising There are four main reasons why Bitcoin and altcoins like Pepe, Casper Network, and Huma Finance are soaring today: US and China trade talks. Buying the dip. Ethereum ETF demand. BTC cup and handle pattern US and China trade talks The first main reason why Bitcoin and altcoins are soaring is that the US and China will hold additional trade talks in London on Monday. These talks follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping earlier this week. They come at a time when tensions between the two countries have started rising. China has accused the US of violating the agreement made in Switzerland by announcing export control on key items. The US, on the other hand, has accused China of withholding the crucial rare earth materials that its industrial base depends on. Therefore, the talks, if successful, could trigger a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Xi, and end the ongoing tensions. Bitcoin and altcoins rose amid dip buying Further, Bitcoin and other altcoins jumped as investors bought the dip following the recent crash. It is common for market participants to buy the dip after a big decline. This dip-buying can be the start of a new bull run, or it can be a dead cat bounce (DCB). A DCB, also known as a bull trap, is a situation where an asset in a free fall bounces back briefly and then resumes its downtrend. Analysts recommend that investors should always take time before buying the dip since this may be a bull trap. One way of avoiding this trap is to identify specific resistance levels and only buying when they are crossed. In Bitcoin’s case, this area may be the psychological point at $110,000. Ethereum ETF inflows Bitcoin and other altcoins jumped as data showed that Wall Street investors continued to accumulate Ethereum ETFs. These funds added over $25 million on Friday. This increase brought the cumulative four-week gains to over $855 million. That is a sign that there is still demand from investors. Another reason for the rally is that Circle launched a highly successful IPO , which pushed its valuation above $20 billion. Gemini and Kraken are now expected to launch their IPOs later this year. Read more: Circle stock price prediction: is CRCL a good buy today? Bitcoin cup and handle chart pattern BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Further, Bitcoin and altcoins jumped because BTC has formed the cup-and-handle pattern, pointing to more gains. The chart shows that the cup’s upper side was at around $108,877 and its lower side at $74,553, giving it a depth of $34,300. It is now forming the handle section. A bullish breakout above the upper side will lead to more gains, possibly to the resistance point at $142,000. Therefore, a clear bullish breakout for Bitcoin will point to more gains among other altcoins.

2025-06-07T13:01:00,"From seizure to sale: Beijing taps Hong Kong to liquidate crypto","In a move that underscores the strategic value of Hong Kong’s regulatory autonomy, Beijing has established its first formal process for liquidating confiscated cryptocurrencies—tapping into Hong Kong’s licensed exchanges to offload digital assets seized in criminal cases. The arrangement highlights the stark policy divide between mainland China’s hardline anti-crypto stance and Hong Kong’s ambitions as a digital asset hub. It also offers a practical solution for Chinese authorities to convert seized crypto into fiat currency without breaching domestic restrictions. According to a local report from Tech In Asia , Beijing’s Public Security Bureau established a disposal framework that involves collaboration with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to coordinate the sale of virtual assets seized in criminal cases. Third-party agencies will carry out transactions on licensed platforms, and proceeds will be converted to yuan and transferred to designated government accounts. This marks the first formal process established by mainland Chinese authorities for disposing of seized crypto. You might also like: Lightchain AI gains trader favor as Polygon fails to turn tech hype into real demand China’s crypto catch finds a Hong Kong exit The decision to use Hong Kong’s regulated cryptocurrency infrastructure shows a major, stark regulatory divide between mainland China and the Special Administrative Region. While Beijing maintains one of the world’s most restrictive cryptocurrency policies, Hong Kong has actively cultivated its position as a regional digital asset hub. Hong Kong’s regulatory framework allows licensed exchanges to serve institutional and qualified retail investors. This creates an ideal conduit for Chinese authorities seeking to liquidate seized assets and also maintain compliance with mainland restrictions. The arrangement shows Hong Kong’s strategic value as a bridge between China’s strict domestic policies and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Licensed exchanges in the territory can process large-scale transactions and also ensures regulatory compliance and proper documentation. You might also like: Gemini moves toward IPO as regulatory pressure eases Chinese law enforcement agencies have accumulated substantial cryptocurrency holdings through criminal investigations and asset seizures. Official estimates suggest authorities control approximately 194,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 833,000 Ethereum ( ETH ). Previously, Chinese authorities lacked established mechanisms for converting seized cryptocurrencies into traditional currency. The timing coincides with global trends in government cryptocurrency holdings, as law enforcement agencies worldwide are puzzled on how to manage the substantial digital asset seizures. The United States government currently holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion, while the United Kingdom possesses over 61,000 Bitcoin from fraud investigations. Beijing’s decision to utilize Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency infrastructure shows the practical flexibility within China’s “One Country, Two Systems” framework. The arrangement allows mainland authorities to access regulated cryptocurrency markets without compromising domestic policy positions. Chinese authorities maintain that the liquidation process aligns with existing anti-cryptocurrency policies by removing seized digital assets from circulation rather than facilitating new trading activities. The framework establishes clear procedures for converting volatile digital assets into stable fiat currency and reduces storage risks and administrative burdens associated with long-term cryptocurrency custody.

2025-06-07T13:00:53,"Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback – Bulls Eye $3,000 Level","Ethereum has faced a sharp pullback, dropping over 10% in the last 24 hours as global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty shake investor confidence across markets. The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins—including Ethereum—are under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH’s ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range. The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play. Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets. ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range. Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 — a psychological and technical milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The chart shows that ETH’s recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 — a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 Volume has remained moderate, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before entering new positions. As long as ETH holds above the $2,400–$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid.

Meanwhile, in a separate meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Saqib discussed the challenges and approaches to the growing digital asset industry in the country. He mentioned that the sector opens up a high-potential market, but the country needs to be careful about how it decides to approach it in terms of regulation, so it can help it and not stifle its growth. During the meeting, which took place at Mayor Adam’s residence, Saqib noted that the Pakistan Crypto Council is willing to work with New York City to aid regulation and innovation. Crypto collaboration on the horizon in the country New York and Pakistan have both launched their respective crypto councils, as they aim to ensure responsible growth of their digital asset sector. The meeting marked a step towards direct collaboration between the two councils, with plans to develop knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and policy advisory initiatives. The visit to Gracie Mansion concluded his official US tour, which focused on blockchain innovation, public-private partnerships, and international crypto cooperation. Over the past few months, the country has set up several initiatives as it aims to regulate the crypto industry. After setting up the PCC, it set up the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp­liant and responsible adoption of digital assets. The PCC meeting held earlier this month touched on various subjects, including a draft framework to regulate the sector. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb, who also serves as the chairman of the PCC. He discussed the formation of a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, law, and IT & telecom divisions to review draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure for digital assets. The PCC also convened a meeting last week to discuss confusion surrounding its crypto policy. The development came after internal arguments over the legality of holding digital assets in the country, a stance that the State Bank of Pakistan has clarified.

2025-06-07T12:25:56,"Expert Predicts What 2,000 XRP Will Be Worth by the End of 2025","A recent analysis from crypto commentator Steph presents two potential valuation scenarios for XRP by the close of the 2025 bull market. Drawing from market dominance trends and technical chart patterns, Steph explores how much 2,000 XRP could be worth if it reclaims its former market position. Market Dominance and Historical Performance XRP once held a significant portion of the overall cryptocurrency market, reaching a peak dominance of about 30% during previous bullish cycles. However, its share has diminished in recent years, sitting at approximately 4% at the time of Steph’s report. In contrast, Bitcoin currently accounts for 62% of the market share, with Ethereum holding around 10%. Steph believes XRP has broken free from a downtrend that began in 2017. This shift, he argues, could mark the beginning of a recovery in XRP’s dominance and price. To evaluate XRP’s potential, he outlines two scenarios based on different assumptions about total crypto market capitalization and XRP’s possible share of it. WHAT 2,000 #XRP COINS WILL BE WORTH IN 2025 (Crazy Rich!) pic.twitter.com/odEckX57XM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 25, 2025 Scenario 1: Flat Market Cap, Strong XRP Growth In this conservative case, the overall cryptocurrency market cap remains unchanged at $3.48 trillion. If XRP regains a 30% market share under these conditions, its price would increase substantially. According to Steph’s calculations, XRP could reach $17.10 per token. At that price, a portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens would be valued at $34,200. Based on a current investment of around $4,650, this would represent a return exceeding 600%. However, the analysis acknowledges that this outcome depends heavily on XRP outperforming the broader market, which may not be likely in a flat-growth environment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Scenario 2: Market Expansion and Higher Valuation The second scenario envisions a more optimistic market trajectory, with total capitalization doubling to $6.96 trillion. Should XRP attain 30% market dominance under these conditions, Steph estimates the token’s value would climb to $34.20. This would bring the total value of 2,000 XRP tokens to $68,400, yielding a return of over 1,370% from current price levels. Steph argues this outcome is within reach, supported by increasing institutional involvement. Some financial entities have reportedly shown interest in holding XRP as part of their treasury assets, while others are exploring the launch of exchange-traded products tied to the cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Momentum Steph also highlights a technical setup on XRP’s monthly chart, specifically a double bottom formation with a confirmed breakout above resistance. This pattern, he notes, suggests a bullish continuation and aligns with the price targets discussed in both scenarios. Based on this chart structure alone, XRP could approach $30 in value, consistent with Scenario 2’s projection. While Steph’s projections present compelling upside potential, he cautions that market dominance levels are inherently unpredictable. Even if XRP reaches only 15–20% market share, the gains could still be substantial. However, investors are advised to exercise due diligence and remain realistic about market volatility and competitive dynamics.

2025-06-07T12:20:51,"Bitcoin Advocates Urge Elon Musk to Go All-In Amid Feud With Trump","As tensions escalate between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the U.S. President Donald Trump, prominent voices from the Bitcoin community are urging Musk to respond by embracing BTC more aggressively. According to analysts and industry leaders, adopting a full-fledged Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful financial and political move for Musk. “Full porting Bitcoin is the best way for Elon to get back at Trump,” wrote crypto analyst Will Clemente in a June 6 post on X. Echoing that view, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow made a direct appeal to Musk: “@elonmusk, it’s time to go all in on Bitcoin.” The comments come amid a series of public barbs traded between Musk and Trump on social media over taxes, tariffs, and government subsidies. Calls for Tesla to Resume Bitcoin Payments Mow further urged Musk to resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases—a move the company paused in 2021 due to environmental concerns. He also called on Tesla to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy to diversify its holdings away from fiat currencies. Despite discontinuing Bitcoin payments, Tesla still holds significant digital assets , which declined in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1 2024. Mow proposed that Musk extend BTC payment options to SpaceX customers by offering launch discounts for BTC payments. “Force a hard money standard on the money printers,” Mow added, in a pointed comment directed at fiat-based financial systems and central banks. The push follows growing criticism that the U.S. government has failed to act on its so-called Strategic BTC Reserve, which was reportedly signed into executive order form by Trump months ago but hasn’t yet materialized into any purchases. Musk’s Potential Influence on Bitcoin Global Narrative Some believe that if Musk does commit fully to Bitcoin, the impact would be global and transformational. Lomob CEO Boyd Cohen noted, “If Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off. He doesn’t do anything small.” Cohen predicted Musk could rapidly build the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury and influence global adoption through his companies. The feud intensified after Musk criticized Trump’s tax plan and warned that his proposed global tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession. Trump fired back by suggesting that eliminating Musk’s government subsidies could save taxpayers billions. While Musk has a history of engaging with crypto, most recently discussing BTC-style encryption for X’s messaging feature, many are watching closely to see whether he will translate his crypto commentary into action.

2025-06-07T12:05:07,"Stunning Statements from MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor – “The Price of Bitcoin in 2045…”","Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), one of the most prominent advocates of Bitcoin, announced both the company's new capital raising plans and his expectations for the future of Bitcoin on the Squawk Box program he attended on CNBC. Saylor said the company aims to raise approximately $1 billion through a 10% fixed-income preferred stock offering. The majority of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, particularly for the purchase of more Bitcoin. Saylor, who stated that they have made three different preferred stock offerings in the last six months, said that these vehicles offer high fixed returns to investors, and at the same time, the company increases shareholder value by directing these funds to Bitcoin investments. According to Saylor, this model offers “indefinite” fixed-income investments with no debt maturity and no refinancing risk. “By pairing a long-term liability with a long-term asset, we are essentially creating an indestructible balance sheet,” Saylor said, outlining the company’s strategy. He argued that this model offers both an attractive 10% yield for fixed income investors and indirectly gives equity investors access to more Bitcoin. Touching on the regulatory front, Saylor stated that the recent recognition of Bitcoin as a “digital commodity” by the US administration, the positive changes made in accounting standards, and the green light given to Bitcoin by banks show the improvement in the sector. Related News: Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details One of the most striking statements on the program was Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin forecast. Referring to a speech he gave in July 2024, Saylor argued that Bitcoin could provide an average annual compound return of 30% for the next 20 years. According to this scenario, Bitcoin could reach $13 million in 2045. Citing past performance as an example, Saylor said Bitcoin has gained 57% annually over the past four and a half years, four times the S&P 500 and eight times the real estate and bond returns. “Bitcoin is crushing everything,” he said. His statements at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference also came to the fore. Saylor reiterated that he was against Strategy’s “proof-of-reserves” application for the 567,000 Bitcoins it holds. Stating that this poses a security risk, Saylor stated that he maintained this view despite the criticisms of some Bitcoin advocates who called for transparency. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-07T12:04:31,"Investors Remain Cautiously Optimistic as Market Sees Volatility Toward The Weekend: Report","Over the last 48 hours, millions of dollars have been liquidated in the cryptocurrency market due to tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their public dispute has caused markets to end the week on a bearish note. However, a weekly report from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance indicates that investors are cautiously optimistic, with growing confidence in a soft landing and a slowly cooling economy. Still, they remain sensitive to inflation risks and signals from the Federal Reserve. Trump-Musk Feud Shakes Markets Bitcoin (BTC), which has mostly consolidated between $104,000 and $106,000 since the beginning of the week, fell below $101,000, tumbling to a multi-week low amid the Trump-Musk feud . Ether (ETH) also took a hit, briefly falling below $2,400. Besides the struggling prices of BTC and ETH, their balances on crypto exchanges recorded significant drops in the first few days of the month. Since the start of May, the metric tracking the two biggest digital assets has plummeted 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. This plunge in supply has marked new yearly lows for the balances of BTC and ETH held on exchanges. Binance believes this could be a sign of accumulation because investors are moving their assets off trading platforms. Moreover, bitcoin’s correlation with equities and gold has continued to hold. The two-month BTC–S&P 500 correlation rose to 0.49 from last week, while the cryptocurrency’s correlation with gold climbed to 0.09. ETFs Gain Institutional Traction On the brighter side, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining institutional traction, which can be attributed to some recent regulatory reforms. Towards the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance stating that staking activities on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks do not constitute securities transfers. From then on, crypto ETF providers could incorporate staking rewards into their offerings. Building on the same momentum, the multinational finance giant JPMorgan announced two days ago that it would allow clients to use crypto ETF shares as collateral for loans. Notably, Circle, the stablecoin issuer behind the USD Coin (USDC), launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm raised $1.5 billion for the IPO by selling 34 million shares at $31 each. However, the 220 million outstanding shares disclosed in its June 2 filing with the SEC said the valuation stood at $6.9 billion. At the time of writing, the firm had a market capitalization of at least $20 billion, following the skyrocketing of its shares on the NYSE after the listing.

2025-06-07T12:04:24,"Chainlink Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Like Mining Bitcoin in 2010 From Your Phone","The post Chainlink Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Like Mining Bitcoin in 2010 From Your Phone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chainlink bulls have long argued that LINK is one of the most essential utility tokens in all of crypto. With its oracles powering smart contracts and deep integrations across DeFi, LINK has earned its reputation. But recent long-term projections—like a modest $29.83 price in 2040—have some investors wondering if they’re aiming too low. And that’s why a growing number of Chainlink price analysts are shifting their gaze toward a new contender: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Why? Because it doesn’t just forecast growth—it unlocks wealth creation today. And it does it from the one tool every investor already owns: their phone. LINK Has Utility—But BTC-S Has Income Chainlink’s ecosystem is thriving. It secures billions in DeFi, anchors hybrid contracts, and powers financial data pipelines. But it’s primarily a backend service layer, not a direct income generator for everyday users. Bitcoin Solaris flips that model. It’s built not just for developers, but for anyone who wants to earn. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine, manage, and grow BTC-S directly from mobile devices and laptops—no expensive equipment, no technical skill, no waiting. And that’s a game-changer. The Solaris Nova App Is Making Crypto Passive Again At the center of the BTC-S movement is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, a beautifully designed mining suite that transforms the most common devices—phones, laptops, and browsers—into daily earning tools. What it delivers: Tap-to-mine setup optimized for non-technical users Seamless operation across Android, iOS, Windows, and browser platforms Built-in wallet with biometric login and encrypted keys Real-time mining stats and earnings tracking Performance-based gamification and leaderboard features Smart device-aware energy usage controls This isn’t just accessibility—it’s wealth-building in disguise. Users can begin mining without capital barriers, echoing the energy of 2010 Bitcoin miners… except now, it fits in your pocket. Deep Architecture Powering the Simplicity BTC-S isn’t only about usability. Behind the tap-to-earn interface is one of the most powerful blockchain designs in the market: a hybrid dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW, with 5-minute block times, anchored on accumulated hash power Solaris Layer: DPoS with 21 active validators, rotating every 24 hours Smart contract throughput of up to 100,000 TPS Block size scaling up to 32MB Smart contracts written in Rust, following the Solana development model Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy and compliance This dual-consensus structure allows BTC-S to combine decentralized security with lightning-fast execution, making it a true powerhouse for both developers and earners. Turn Your Device Into a Mining Machine Real Rewards: Distribution That Favors Participation Unlike tokens, where gains depend solely on market movements, BTC-S includes direct block-level rewards: 40% of mining rewards go to Base Layer PoW miners 25% to Solaris Layer validators 20% to stakers Bonus weighting based on device specs, uptime, and contribution value This creates a powerful flywheel: users mine, get rewarded, and reinvest—all within the same decentralized ecosystem. Influencers Are Paying Attention Crypto analysts and influencers have begun echoing what early adopters already know: BTC-S isn’t hype—it’s built. Crypto Legends : Broke down how BTC-S “feels like early Bitcoin all over again—except this time, it’s mobile.” Crypto Royal : Highlighted the layered architecture and validator fairness model. Token Empire : Called the upcoming app “a gateway to passive crypto ownership for the average user.” Token Galaxy : Focused on how the dynamic reward system encourages long-term engagement. This kind of influencer alignment rarely happens during presale phases, but it’s happening now. Presale Fueling the Engine Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just being praised—it’s being purchased. Over 11,000 unique users have already joined, and with over $3 million raised , the momentum is undeniable. What’s more, it’s happening under a strict 90-day schedule, making it one of the shortest presales in recent memory. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Ends: July 31, 2025 Return Potential: 1,900% Only ~8 weeks remain There’s no fluff—just utility, daily engagement, and rising demand. Security, Community, and Compliance BTC-S understands that in 2025, credibility matters. That’s why it’s already passed a rigorous audit by Cyberscope , and its team is fully KYC-verified . It also maintains strong, responsive presence across Telegram and X , where updates, AMAs, and presale stats are shared live. Transparency isn’t a feature—it’s standard operating procedure. Conclusion: From Chainlink Predictions to Bitcoin Solaris Reality Chainlink will always have a place in Web3 infrastructure. But at 5% projected annual growth, it’s not a path to overnight wealth. BTC-S, on the other hand, is engineering accessibility, income, and growth directly into its architecture, then placing that power in the hands of users. This isn’t a model built for institutions—it’s built for you. And if you missed mining Bitcoin in 2010, this time, you’re holding the rig in your hand.

Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson pointed out , “ Now that we are on the other side of the tempest in the teacup, the ecosystem can move on to higher ground with greener pastures. We have left behind slander brigades, disgruntled exes, and toxic energy vampires for Bitcoin DeFi, governance finally taking shape, Midnight, and massive advances like Leios and Midgard.” Therefore, Hoskinson is optimistic that Cardano will enter the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in full swing because it will act as a stepping stone towards driving innovation and unlocking new financial opportunities in the crypto space.

Analyst Brian Meredith still has a buy rating on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Class B shares, but has cut the price target from $606 per share to $591, reports CNBC. In an investment note, Meredith says the decline in the share price target is due to the expectation of less investment income as well as no stock buybacks this year and in 2026. “We continue to believe BRK’s shares are attractive in an uncertain macro environment with $347 billion of cash and [short-term] investments, a defensive business mix, and manageable tariff exposure.” Data shows Berkshire’s billionaire CEO Warren Buffett has parked $305.5 billion into the safe-haven asset class, short-dated Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. At the same time, the firm has been slashing stakes in banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America, and Capital One. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.
