2025-06-07T02:00:22,"Cardano Unveils 39 Proposals Under New Budget Framework","Cardano’s governance experiment took a decisive step forward on 5 June, when Intersect—a member-based organisation tasked with stewarding the blockchain’s transition to on-chain self-rule—published its first Budget Info Action (BIA). The nine-minute overview lays out 39 community-driven proposals that Delegated Representatives (DReps) have already signalled for funding. “The Budget Info Action brings together 39 proposals that reflect where the community sees opportunities, needs, and momentum,” Intersect explained, stressing that the roadmap was drafted “by a network of builders, researchers, developers, and contributors working together to deliver real value.” Cardano’s Next Chapter Begins The package reveals where Cardano’s stakeholders think resources will matter most over the next 18 months. Nearly half the proposals address performance at the protocol layer. Input Output Global (IOG) seeks continued maintenance budgets for Hydra , its off-chain state-channel suite, and Mithril , the fast-sync protocol designed to make full-node deployment as effortless as setting up a light wallet. IOG also asks for funding to refine stake-pool-operator (SPO) incentives, overhaul fee mechanics, and roll out new developer-testing pipelines. Two experimental designs— Leios and Peras—would push finality toward sub-second territory and multiply throughput without compromising decentralisation. Tweag, best known for its Haskell and formal-verification expertise, proposes multi-year stewardship of the critical libraries on which both the consensus layer and off-chain tooling depend. Governance tooling emerges as the second-largest theme. A refreshed “Catalyst 2.0” initiative would wire treasury voting directly into CIP-1694 governance flows, ending the separation between project funding rounds and constitutional decision-making. Complement Catalyst—a proposal from social-impact startup Socious—introduces quadratic funding weighted by on-chain reputation scores, a mechanism it says will “boost fairness, transparency, and community impact.” Cardano Builder DAO wants a smart-contract-controlled endowment that can approve application-layer grants autonomously, while the “Beyond Minimum Viable Governance” report promises the first data-driven audit of how Voltaire-era institutions are actually functioning in practice. Developer experience and open-source infrastructure form the third pillar. MLabs asks to maintain Plutarch, CardanoOps, and Hermes, three projects it argues “remove friction for DApp teams by letting them focus on product, not plumbing.” Pallas would continue curating the Rust libraries that power lightweight indexers and explorers, while Blockfrost seeks to keep its plug-and-play API free at the point of use. NFTCDN proposes a global, cost-free content-delivery network for native assets so marketplaces can serve media files “with Web-2 latency but Web-3 integrity.” A cluster of proposals focuses on resilience and security. Dolos, a lightweight data-node implementation, promises “high-integrity ledger queries with minimal resource overhead,” a feature aimed at mobile developers and IoT deployers. TxPipe wants to maintain its open-source RPC server that already backs dozens of wallets, explorers, and analytics dashboards. In parallel, Eternl requests funds for ongoing hardware-wallet integration, and an independent team proposes a full rewrite of Ledger’s Cardano application to unlock advanced multi-sig features. Sundae Labs and Xerberus have submitted an auditable smart-contract framework that will govern how treasury withdrawals are disbursed, exposing live dashboards so ADA holders can watch spending as it happens. Education, outreach, and real-world adoption round out the slate. Discover Cardano plans branded pavilions at major tech expos, offering what it calls “shared spaces to amplify the voice of Cardano’s community and lower barriers for builders.” A linked proposal seeks to centralise global events marketing so that every Summit-style gathering has consistent branding and clear onboarding funnels. On the utility front, Anzens wants funds to expand access to USDA, a USD-backed stable-asset issued natively on Cardano, through exchange listings, institutional custody, and cross-border settlement pilots. Meanwhile, MLabs’ cryptography team outlines a toolkit for privacy-preserving smart contracts that could enable anonymous voting, shielded identity credentials, and confidential DeFi. What’s Next? Each item in the BIA is advisory for now. Under CIP-1694, ADA holders have a 30-day review window to approve or reject the bundle. If passed, Intersect will translate the document into one or more Treasury Withdrawal actions that carry hard spending authority and require a two-thirds super-majority on-chain. The organisation has floated splitting the withdrawals into tranches so that “funds are released only as milestones are met,” a safeguard meant to reassure both sceptical stakeholders and external regulators that Cardano can allocate capital with the same rigour expected of a public-sector budget. In publishing the BIA, Intersect framed the moment as a stress-test for decentralised governance. “This isn’t just a budget,” the post reads. “It’s a signal that Cardano’s ecosystem is ready to deliver.” If the community ratifies the 39-proposal slate, Cardano will move beyond ad-hoc Catalyst rounds toward a predictable, constitutional funding cycle—transforming Voltaire’s aspirational blueprint into the network’s first working balance sheet.

2025-06-07T01:40:22,"Tech giants explore stablecoin integration","Tech behemoths Apple, Google, Airbnb, and X (formerly Twitter), among others, are reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins into their platforms, according to multiple industry sources familiar with the matter. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets , such as the US dollar. They provide the advantages of blockchain but without the volatility that has plagued more traditional crypto tokens like Bitcoin. These discussions are occurring as demand increases for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. The positives are also obvious for tech companies like Airbnb, which are globally reachable. Accepting stablecoins could also avert steep fees charged by credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. An Airbnb spokesperson said that the company is “always looking at all aspects of payments” for improving user experience , but it is also looking into digital assets. According to previous reports, X has reportedly expressed an interest in adding stablecoin payments to its upcoming payments product, X Money. According to sources, Elon Musk’s team has been in touch with crypto companies, and the company is in talks with Stripe about integration. The aim is to realize Musk’s ideal of an “ everything app ” that blends social media, payments, and commerce. Apple is also keen on stablecoin functionality through its Apple Pay infrastructure. Sources hint the tech firm has been in talks with Circle, the minters of the hugely popular USDC stablecoin, since early this year. Google was interested, too, it was reported. Rich Widmann, who leads Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, has called stablecoins “one of the biggest upgrades to payments since the SWIFT network.” Stripe bets on stablecoins with bold acquisition Stripe, one of the world’s largest payment processors, has made a bold bet. It recently purchased Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure startup with funding from vendor capital firm Haun Ventures. Bridge has been working on tools to enable businesses to implement stablecoin payments quickly and securely. Stripe’s purchase of Bridge was interpreted as a sign that stablecoins have turned the corner in Silicon Valley. The deal also gave Stripe a technical advantage — Bridge’s infrastructure will be used to assist Stripe in making it possible for accounts and payments to be made in a stablecoin, which is important for global freelancers and marketplaces. Visa has followed suit by rolling out pilots for issuing stablecoin-linked cards with Bridge in April 2025. The sources say Airbnb is discussing with one of its existing payment partners the incorporation of one of the popular stablecoins to facilitate easy payment processes. Worldpay recently disclosed that it would facilitate stablecoin payouts by partnering with BNVK, a crypto infrastructure provider. Trump administration eases crypto regulations In the United States, legislators are considering two bills to regulate stablecoins. The most high-profile, known as the GENIUS Act , details consumer protections, reserve requirements, and oversight mechanisms for issuers of digital dollars. Big Tech was hesitant about crypto in part because of scrutiny under the Biden administration. But the political winds are shifting. The second term of Donald Trump has injected vitality into the realm of blockchain. His administration has pursued a more hands-off approach, pushing agencies to roll back rules and embrace crypto innovation. This policy change has reawakened some dormant dreams. Two years after regulatory opposition forced Meta to mothball its Diem stablecoin project, the parent company reconsidered its views on crypto payments. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said recently that the ride-hailing company is examining the use of stablecoins for its global transfers. Uber’s interest is further evidence of a broader trend circulating throughout tech circles, not just a niche idea. For now, the tone is most cautious among most firms, including Google and Airbnb. They are not promising instant launches. However, their research, alliances, and internal experiments indicate that they are gaining confidence in the future for stablecoins.

2025-06-07T01:30:53,"Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows","Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply over the past 24 hours, nearing the $100,000 mark with an intraday low of $100,984. This price movement reflects increased volatility across the crypto market following a public exchange on social media between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 Derivative Metrics Reveal Bearish Sentiment Spike According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Binance net taker volume, a metric that measures the difference between aggressive longs and shorts, fell dramatically from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. 🔔When Funding rates turns negative. 🔹 Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

2025-06-07T01:14:36,"Will Fidelity’s stablecoin transform the crypto market?","Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s most respected financial institutions, has made significant strides in digital assets in recent years. The firm offers institutional clients Bitcoin and Ethereum custody and trading services through Fidelity Digital Assets. It has also explored blockchain applications in settlement and tokenized securities—efforts that underline its long-term commitment to bridging traditional and digital finance. While there is no official confirmation, a representative of Fidelity recently said that the firm’s digital asset arm was experimenting with a stablecoin. However, it did not have immediate plans to launch one. The arrival of Fidelity into stablecoins will likely bring more trust, attention, and skills to the stablecoin ecosystem. However, it could also invite tougher scrutiny from regulators and raise concerns about fairness or the likelihood that a handful of large players could dominate the market . Some people believe Fidelity’s new stablecoin will help provide safer, more reliable digital payment options. However, critics say it could create problems with oversight, limit competition, and concentrate too much power in the hands of a few large firms. How does Fidelity’s stablecoin help innovation? Reports indicate that Fidelity has a pilot program for a stablecoin backed by the US dollar to make faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments and settlements than traditional methods. The company wants to build a bridge between old and new finance, and its investment shows that trusted, well-established financial institutions see stablecoins as a serious and credible part of the future financial system. Some crypto experts suggest Fidelity’s move will push banks, payment providers, and fintech companies to adopt blockchain technology faster and improve their services due to the growing competition. Blockchain experts also pointed out the success of Fidelity’s early pilot programs, saying the trials show promising results that could fuel optimism among other big players and make digital financial systems more accessible for everyone. What risks come with Fidelity’s stablecoin? Some critics say unclear rules for digital currencies make it hard for investors, companies, and regulators to know what’s fair or how to keep the market safe. Others, though, fear that large firms like Fidelity will crowd out small start-ups and prevent these new and innovative businesses from getting a fair shot at competition and that the end result will be less fresh ideas and new competition. Some people fear that if just a handful of big companies dominate most stablecoins, it could risk the entire financial system if any one of them encounters trouble. They also worry about whether these companies will be truthful when they claim to manage their reserves responsibly and to keep users safe. Fidelity’s stablecoin initiative is part of a larger trend where many traditional banks and fintech companies actively develop their own stablecoins or explore blockchain technology to improve payment systems and financial services. Those advantages have attracted the attention of political leaders and regulators who agree there is an opportunity for the industry to expand and offer benefits to more people but have also sought to create clear rules to remove the risks associated with these tokens and to shield consumers from potential harm. Some crypto projects are concerned that large finance companies like Fidelity will use their vast amounts of resources to take over a large part of the crypto space and discourage new innovations from startups, which beats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. As a result, there is a growing push and pull between industry experts who want regulators to create soft laws that will help the crypto industry grow by making it fair for small companies to compete with large firms and those who want strict rules that will protect everyone from the dominance of large financial institutions. What does Fidelity’s stablecoin mean for the future? People and financial firms that have doubts about cryptocurrencies will get a positive perspective about investing in digital currency when they see Fidelity’s stablecoin initiative succeed. Big banks and fintech companies will also be motivated to develop their own stablecoins or develop new blockchain solutions to help make digital finance accessible to a wider audience. We still can’t ignore the risks involved because it is possible that large firms like Fidelity might try to dominate the crypto market once they see the company succeed. This means they will have more influence on whether they are worthy of joining the crypto space, which would make it difficult for smaller firms to compete. The current laws around cryptocurrency also don’t fully address the problems big companies bring when they introduce their own coins. This is because these firms must follow heavy compliance requirements and need tight supervision that smaller companies will struggle to keep up with. The success or failure of Fidelity’s stablecoin will likely shape the future of both traditional finance and the crypto world, influencing how open, fair, and innovative this industry can become.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock’s ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether’s price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-can-rising-demand-from-blackrock-fuel-bullish-momentum/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The New York Federal Reserve Bank, which handles the Fed’s bond transactions, just disclosed the losses, linking them to the central bank’s tight monetary stance. The Fed’s bonds are losing value as the bank maintains higher-for-longer interest rates in a push to fight inflation. The agency says it will ensure the losses won’t hit its bottom line or cash transfers to the Treasury. “The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA portfolio has no effect on net income or Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury unless assets are sold and gains or losses are realized. Unrealized gains and losses have no effect on the conduct of monetary policy.” The New York Fed also notes the unrealized losses, which are recorded through the end of 2024, were offset slightly as the central bank let bonds mature without reinvesting. The Fed’s bond portfolio began witnessing significant unrealized losses over the previous two years, clocking $1.08 trillion in 2022 and $948.4 billion in 2023. The account witnessed unrealized gains of $354 billion in 2020 and $127.9 billion in 2021.

2025-06-07T00:00:51,"Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That’s Forming","After days of fluctuating around the $105,000 range, Bitcoin appears to be succumbing to pressure from bears and profit-taking from traders. The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head’s peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin’s daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-dead-cat-bounce-or-full-blown-rebound/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The world’s leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the “Big Beautiful Bill” criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance’s net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions—particularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump—injecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs.

Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher. However, failure to reclaim the moving averages may signal exhaustion and expose the price to another retest of the $100K psychological level.

2025-06-06T22:36:18,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June – Bitcoin, Solana, XRP","Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins —Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them—have each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let’s explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World’s Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world’s biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto’s flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto’s future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto’s $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL’s appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76—up 1% in the last 24 hours—mirroring Bitcoin’s brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple’s Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple’s XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP’s retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin’s 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure.

According to a New York Times report , the Missouri Republican Senator is saying “no” to the upcoming GENIUS Act. “It’s a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don’t see why we would do that.” According to the Times report, the GENIUS Act could potentially upend the credit card industry and benefit both Trump and Musk, who are currently publicly feuding . Hawley is pushing for amendments to the bill that would curtail Big Tech’s involvement. GENIUS is an acronym meaning “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins”. The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion. Yesterday, the second-biggest player in the US-dollar pegged stablecoin space, Circle, issuer of USDC, launched its initial public offering, or IPO. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL.” In its New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) debut, Circle saw an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the IPO price of $31 per share.

The regulatory environment continues to evolve, sometimes sharply divided between federal hesitations and state-level innovation. Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure In a striking development, Texas Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) came under fire for failing to disclose his Bitcoin purchases in a timely manner . Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) is under fire for allegedly improperly disclosing recent Bitcoin transactions. #BrandonGill #DonaldTrump https://t.co/JbID89ntiW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 According to a report from Open Secrets, Gill bought between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin on January 29 and February 27. However, the disclosures didn’t appear until May 30—well beyond the 45-day window mandated by the STOCK Act, which is designed to prevent insider trading by public officials. The freshman congressman’s failure to comply with basic transparency protocols has sparked criticism, particularly as lawmakers increasingly shape crypto policy. The delayed filings raise questions about oversight and ethical conduct amid the sector’s surging political relevance. Crypto advocates may see Gill’s holdings as a sign of growing interest within Congress, but his misstep shows the need for stricter accountability when digital assets enter the halls of power. SEC Chair Paul Atkins Calls Out Enforcement-First Approach Over in Washington, SEC Chair Paul Atkins delivered pointed remarks before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee this week, criticizing the agency’s previous stance of “regulation-by-enforcement” toward crypto. BREAKING SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says his top priority is a clear, rational crypto regulatory framework —….. especially around custody & $XRP Clarity is coming. pic.twitter.com/30eyZLdwEg — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 3, 2025 Atkins argued that the former approach stifled innovation and inadvertently opened the door for fraudulent behavior to flourish. “Enforcement without clear rules sends the wrong message,” Atkins said, emphasizing the need for proactive, rules-based regulation. He also praised the SEC’s revamped Crypto Task Force, describing it as a key player in developing a more nuanced and transparent regulatory framework for digital assets. This shift in rhetoric from the SEC’s highest office marks a potential turning point in crypto regulation. For years, the agency’s ambiguous stance has frustrated industry players. Atkins’ testimony could pave the way for more constructive engagement with blockchain projects—if it results in real policy changes and not just regulatory lip service. California Leads With Progressive Crypto Legislation While federal agencies wrestle with regulatory philosophy and enforcement, California is pushing ahead with bold legislative moves that could redefine state-level crypto governance. The State Assembly passed Assembly Bill 1180 with unanimous support on June 2. The bill authorizes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to create a pilot program allowing state fees to be paid using digital financial assets. Assembly member Avelino Valencia, the bill’s sponsor, called the move “a turning point for public sector adoption of financial technologies.” This marks one of the most concrete steps by any U.S. state toward integrating crypto into official government operations. Should the bill progress into law, California could serve as a testing ground for broader crypto utility in public finance, potentially setting a template for others to follow. Hot on the heels of AB 1180, another bill —Assembly Bill 1052—also cleared the State Assembly in a 78-0 vote. AB 1052 seeks to modernize unclaimed property laws, particularly how dormant digital assets are handled. JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 If passed by the Senate, the law would prevent dormant crypto held by custodians (like exchanges) from being automatically liquidated. Instead, these assets would be safeguarded in their native form by a licensed custodian. This legislation specifically excludes self-custodied wallets from its reach, a key detail for privacy advocates and decentralization purists. Together, these two bills reflect a state legislature that understands the nuances of crypto and is willing to embrace its potential while mitigating risk. SEC Secures $1.1M Judgment in Crypto Fraud Case Elsewhere, the SEC notched a courtroom win against bad actors in the crypto space. A federal judge in Georgia issued a default judgment on June 3 against Keith Crews, who was accused of orchestrating a fraudulent crypto investment scheme. Crews failed to respond to the SEC’s lawsuit, resulting in a $1.1 million penalty that includes disgorged profits and civil fines. This case reinforces the agency’s ongoing commitment to enforcement, especially against blatant scams and fraudulent offerings. While Atkins may be steering the SEC away from broad, punitive enforcement as a policy default, this judgment shows that the agency won’t hesitate to act decisively against clear misconduct. State vs. Federal—A Diverging Path? This week’s developments present a revealing contrast. On one hand, California is emerging as a trailblazer in creating thoughtful crypto legislation, focusing on utility and protection. On the other, federal lawmakers continue to grapple with oversight lapses and internal tensions on how best to regulate the space. Congressman Gill’s disclosure mishap illustrates the regulatory gaps in the nation’s capital, while SEC Chair Atkins’ comments suggest a changing of the guard in federal crypto policy. Meanwhile, the SEC’s ongoing enforcement actions indicate that investor protection remains a top priority, even as the agency explores more collaborative approaches.

2025-06-06T20:40:27,"Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment In a significant move signaling growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Davis Commodities (NASDAQ: DTCK) has announced a strategic allocation of funds towards Bitcoin. Following a successful $30 million fundraising round, the company has earmarked 15% of these proceeds, totaling $4.5 million, specifically for acquiring Bitcoin (BTC). This decision, detailed in a recent Globe Newswire press release, positions Davis Commodities among a growing list of publicly traded companies adding the premier cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. But why are companies like Davis Commodities making this move now, and what does it signify for the broader market? Why Davis Commodities is Investing in Bitcoin The press release highlights several key reasons behind Davis Commodities’ decision to build Bitcoin reserves: Enhancing Asset Allocation: Diversifying treasury assets beyond traditional holdings like cash and short-term bonds. Improving Flexibility: Gaining exposure to a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Hedging Against Inflation: Utilizing Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties in an environment of economic uncertainty and potential currency devaluation. This strategy aligns with the rationale provided by other corporations that have previously adopted Bitcoin. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The trend of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets gained significant momentum in recent years. Pioneered by firms like MicroStrategy, this movement has seen various companies across different sectors explore or implement similar strategies. While the scale of investment varies greatly, the underlying motivations often revolve around macroeconomic concerns and the potential long-term value appreciation of Bitcoin. Davis Commodities’ $4.5 million allocation, while modest compared to some larger corporate treasuries, represents a clear statement of intent and a belief in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a component of a modern treasury strategy. It adds another data point to the increasing institutional adoption narrative. Understanding BTC Reserves for Corporations For companies, establishing BTC reserves isn’t just about buying cryptocurrency; it involves navigating various considerations: Benefits: Potential for significant appreciation, boosting treasury value. Diversification away from traditional financial risks. Attracting investors interested in crypto-exposed stocks. Acting as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Challenges: High price volatility, potentially leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions. Custody and security risks associated with holding digital assets. Accounting and tax complexities. Companies must weigh these factors carefully before committing capital to Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Davis Commodities and Investors? For Davis Commodities, this move integrates them into the digital asset landscape. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and could potentially appeal to a new segment of investors interested in companies with exposure to the crypto market. The $4.5 million represents a portion of their newly raised capital, indicating a deliberate strategic choice rather than an impulsive decision. For investors in Davis Commodities, this introduces a new variable. The company’s performance may now be influenced, to some extent, by the price movements of Bitcoin. It also raises questions about the company’s long-term digital asset strategy – is this a one-time purchase, or the beginning of a larger allocation over time? Institutional Adoption Continues to Grow The investment by Davis Commodities is another piece of evidence supporting the narrative of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While retail interest often drives headlines, corporate and institutional investments provide a layer of stability and legitimacy to the asset class. Each new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to its maturity and acceptance within the traditional financial system. This trend is being watched closely by market participants, as significant corporate holdings can influence supply dynamics and market sentiment. The move by Davis Commodities, a company seemingly outside the core tech or finance sectors typically associated with early crypto adoption, is particularly noteworthy. Actionable Insights What can readers take away from this development? Monitor Corporate Filings: Keep an eye on press releases and financial reports from publicly traded companies for similar announcements. Assess Company Strategy: Understand why a company is investing in Bitcoin – is it a treasury hedge, an investment, or part of a new business line? Consider Portfolio Diversification: While not financial advice, the trend of corporate diversification into Bitcoin prompts individuals to consider their own asset allocation strategies. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset holdings is constantly evolving. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for Davis Commodities Davis Commodities’ decision to allocate $4.5 million of its recently raised capital to Bitcoin reserves marks a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Driven by goals of enhanced asset allocation, improved flexibility, and inflation hedging, this move places the company squarely within the burgeoning trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification and long-term value preservation appear to be compelling enough for companies like Davis Commodities to take the plunge. This development further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class attracting attention beyond traditional crypto circles.

2025-06-06T20:00:41,"Quant Analyst PlanB Says Bitcoin Is Currently ‘Very Undervalued,’ Predicts Bull Market’s Just Starting – Here Are His Targets","Quant analyst PlanB is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the flagship crypto asset trades in a range below the all-time high reached late last month. In a new strategy session, PlanB tells his 213,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is far away from reaching the peak of the current four-year cycle based on the stock-to-flow model. The stock-to-flow model is a predictive tool that assumes the scarcity of a commodity drives the price. “Bitcoin price [is] at $104,000, which is still far away from the stock-to-flow value of $500,000 based on fundamentals, scarcity fundamentals. That’s what I expect the average over this four-year cycle to be. So we’re still far away from that. But we’re also still only one year in the cycle, we have three years to go and so I think Bitcoin is very undervalued.” According to Plan B, Bitcoin is at the “very beginning of a bull market” based on historical precedent. “We made a fake loop in bull market territory after the January 2024 [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds] ETF introductions. And we’re now right back at where all the bull markets in the past have started. So it’s a very bullish signal if you ask me.” The quant analyst says Bitcoin could skyrocket by up to approximately 860% over the course of the current cycle. “[Bitcoin] is currently in a bull market, targeting… let’s say $250,000 to $1 million range for the average price in this cycle.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,300 at time of writing.

2025-06-06T20:00:38,"Here’s XRP Likely Price If Its Market Dominance Surges to 40%","XRP’s price trajectory could see significant upward movement if its market dominance rises to 40%, surpassing its historical peak of 31.33%. Currently far from this level, a rise of such magnitude would require XRP to capture a sizable share from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Historical Context of XRP Dominance XRP’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market has fluctuated notably since it first gained significant traction. After the launch of the XRP Ledger, XRP began rising in market prominence, and by October 2014, it had surpassed Litecoin to become the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. Over the following months, its market share climbed steadily, reaching 20.69% in January 2015. However, this dominance began to wane by early 2016 as Ethereum emerged as a strong competitor. XRP’s share of the market eventually dropped to 0.95% by March 2017. This was partly due to XRP underperforming during the early stages of the 2017 bull market. XRP rebounded later that year, and its market dominance peaked at 31.33% when its price hit $3.80. Since then, XRP’s dominance has experienced a prolonged decline, bottoming out at around 1.21% in November 2024. Recent Performance and Current Status Following a slight recovery in price, particularly after the U.S. elections in late 2024, XRP saw a renewed increase in market share. By January 2025, its dominance reached a four-year high of 5.58%. As of now, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.97%, with a market capitalization of $128.51 billion. Despite this relatively low dominance figure, some analysts remain optimistic. They propose a scenario where XRP could reach an unprecedented 40% dominance, well above its previous high. To achieve this, XRP would need to overtake significant portions of the current market share held by Bitcoin (64.15%) and Ethereum (9.71%). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projected Price at 40% Market Dominance If XRP were to achieve 40% dominance in the current $3.24 trillion crypto market, its total market cap would rise to roughly $1.296 trillion. With a circulating supply of around 58.75 billion tokens, this would imply a price point of approximately $22.06 per XRP. Market observers, including figures such as Oscar Ramos, have floated similar projections, suggesting that a $22 price is attainable if XRP reaches a $1 trillion valuation. However, they also acknowledge that achieving 40% market dominance in the current market structure would be a considerable challenge. Notably, XRP might not need to reach 40% dominance to attain a $22 valuation. If its current 3.97% share of the market remains constant while the broader crypto market expands significantly, say to $32.65 trillion, XRP could still reach the $1.296 trillion mark needed for the $22 price target. A July 2023 report from Forbes projected that crypto-focused ETFs could introduce as much as $30 trillion in new capital into the space, providing a potential pathway for such market expansion.

2025-06-06T20:00:07,"Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally","Ethereum has experienced a sharp pullback, retracing over 10% since yesterday as the broader crypto market faced a wave of volatility. Despite the decline, bulls are showing resilience. ETH failed to break below the critical $2,300 mark and is now holding firm above $2,400, a sign that demand remains strong at current levels. Investors are watching closely as Ethereum consolidates and attempts to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 Top analyst M-Log1 shared a technical update indicating that ETH is currently sitting around the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart. This level often acts as a major trend indicator, and reclaiming it could spark renewed bullish momentum. According to M-Log1, Ethereum’s price action suggests a potential recovery toward the $2,600 zone, especially if bulls manage to push above the 50 and 100 MAs. This renewed interest in ETH comes at a pivotal moment for altcoins. Many market participants are now evaluating whether this consolidation phase marks the beginning of a larger move for Ethereum and related assets. For now, all eyes remain on key technical levels as the market awaits confirmation of direction. Ethereum Eyes Recovery After Market Shake-Up Ethereum is showing signs of strength amid heightened market volatility sparked by rising tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. The sharp war of words between the two high-profile figures triggered a wave of uncertainty in financial markets, prompting swift reactions across the cryptocurrency sector. While Bitcoin remains stable above the $100K level, altcoins have experienced significant pullbacks—ETH included. However, the coming weeks are shaping up to be decisive, with many investors closely watching for signs of recovery. ETH has retraced over 10% in recent sessions but is now bouncing from the lows. Bulls appear confident as Ethereum holds above the $2,400 level and attempts to reclaim key moving averages on the 4-hour chart. According to M-Log1, ETH currently sits near the 200MA, a crucial technical level that often signals trend reversals. He notes that Ethereum is bouncing exactly as expected following last week’s broader altcoin correction. M-Log1’s analysis points to the $2,600 level as the next target. A successful push toward that zone, along with reclaiming the 50 and 100 moving averages, could set the stage for a strong rally throughout June. If ETH manages to build momentum and maintain support, the altcoin market could experience renewed bullish energy. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and political risk, Ethereum’s resilience is notable. With technical support holding and confidence slowly returning, the setup remains constructive, assuming bulls continue to defend key levels. As the market digests recent events, ETH’s price action over the next few days will offer critical insight into whether a new altseason can take off or whether further downside is still in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? ETH Weekly Chart: Key Levels Hold Ethereum is currently trading around $2,475 on the weekly chart, showing signs of hesitation as it faces strong resistance near the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $2,450. Although ETH managed to surge above this level briefly, the candle is showing rejection near the $2,680 area, which coincides with both historical resistance and the upper end of the 34-week EMA ($2,499). This confluence of resistance levels is proving to be a critical zone for bulls to reclaim. Despite the recent bounce from April lows, ETH is still struggling to gain bullish momentum on the higher timeframes. The last few candles reflect indecision, with long wicks and narrowing body size, suggesting that while buyers are defending downside levels, sellers remain active near resistance. If ETH fails to close the week above the 200-week SMA, a pullback toward the $2,300–$2,250 range is likely, which aligns with the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout On the upside, a strong weekly close above $2,700 would be a major breakout signal, potentially triggering a broader altseason. For now, Ethereum’s weekly structure remains neutral-to-bullish, with consolidation above the 200-week SMA acting as a key battleground for trend confirmation.

In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers on the social media platform X that it’s “crunch time” for the top crypto asset by market cap after recovering from a dip, noting that it could plunge below $100,000 if BTC bulls don’t step up. “Recap: BTC failed at $110,000 and $106,600 in May [and hit] $100,000 on Thursday. We had the Asia session bounce back to $104,000 as anticipated. Now, does Bitcoin fill the $97,000/$98,000 imbalance? Or can bulls reclaim this $104,000-$105,000 area? Crunch time.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also said that the flagship digital asset bouncing off $100,000 to hit $104,000 was a bullish scenario that would likely send BTC above $106,000. “There you go. Nice bounce from $100,000 support. Looking pretty bullish so far. $104,000-$105,000 is resistance today. A reclaim would be bullish back to $106,600, but it’s resistance until proven otherwise.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett goes on to note that other factors could influence the price of BTC, such as how the US stock market is doing and the dominance levels of Tether ( USDT ), the largest stablecoin in the world by volume. “Almost there, fam. Same target and path I shared for crypto on May 21st. I’m not saying Tether dominance at 5% will be the bottom for BTC, but there should be a strong reaction in that area if tested. Remember that USDT [dominance] moves inversely to Bitcoin.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,202 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

The list includes EU states, the UK, and most G20 countries but excludes the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Exchanges will only occur if partner countries meet reciprocity and compliance benchmarks. Switzerland’s Federal Council has approved a proposal to begin automatically exchanging data on crypto-asset holdings with 74 partner states starting in 2027, according to a statement issued on June 6. The exchange will be based on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The framework mandates information sharing between jurisdictions to detect offshore digital asset holdings and ensure tax compliance. Reciprocity and Compliance Conditions For Data Exchange The approved list includes all EU countries, the United Kingdom , and most G20 members, but excludes the United States and Saudi Arabia. Exchange of data will only proceed if partner jurisdictions agree to reciprocity and meet technical and legal standards set out under CARF. The Swiss parliament is currently reviewing the legal foundation for this data-sharing regime, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. The first data transmission will take place in 2027. The Federal Council stated that the same review mechanisms used for financial account data exchanges will be applied to crypto-asset reporting. Partner states must undergo periodic assessments to verify continued compliance. The update positions Switzerland among the first countries preparing to implement the OECD’s global reporting framework. Authorities said the scope of the exchange may expand, depending on the evolving interest of other countries and future updates to international standards. Drawing on lessons from the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss government is calling for measures like stricter capital requirements for big banks with branches abroad + additional powers for financial market supervisor @FINMA_media . https://t.co/zuWKbuyY5t @efd_dff @sif_sfi pic.twitter.com/n0z3Hvk5hE — Swiss Federal Government (@SwissGov) June 6, 2025 Global Compliance and Local Crypto Use in Switzerland Spar Switzerland recently announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments at all store locations following pilot programs in Zug and Kreuzlingen. The system uses QR codes from DFX Swiss’s OpenCryptoPay platform, allowing Lightning Network payments to settle instantly at checkout. Spar is the first major grocer in the country to adopt Bitcoin at full scale. While regulators are aligning with international reporting standards, merchants and consumers are advancing on separate terms, using Bitcoin for everyday payments without waiting for central bank endorsement. Switzerland now faces a dual trajectory: international compliance through frameworks like the OECD’s CARF, and internal normalization of crypto through market use. This parallel movement could test how governments balance transparency obligations abroad with decentralized payment activity at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is CARF, and how does it differ from previous financial reporting standards? Unlike traditional financial account standards, it includes digital tokens and requires identifying wallet holders and transaction data, even when no intermediaries are involved. Why are the U.S. and Saudi Arabia not included in the approved list? The statement does not detail specific exclusions. However, both countries have taken distinct positions on global tax data-sharing and may not currently meet CARF participation or reciprocity requirements. Are more countries expected to join Switzerland’s data-sharing agreements? Authorities indicated that the scope of exchange could expand based on evolving interest and future changes to OECD standards. Regular assessments will determine which partner states remain eligible.
