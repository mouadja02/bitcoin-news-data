2025-06-07T18:35:58,"Cardano, Litecoin and Remittix Look Ready To Soar In June If Bitcoin Plays Ball","In crypto, Bitcoin doesn’t just lead, it orchestrates. With a $2 trillion market cap and dominance over 40% of the entire crypto market, its every move sends ripples across the altcoin sea. Most altcoins move in lockstep with it, boasting a correlation as high as 0.9. So when Bitcoin flinches, the rest of the market often follows. That’s why all eyes are on BTC this June. A confirmed breakout could ignite what traders call “altcoin season”, and some coins are perfectly positioned to ride the wave. Cardano is flashing bullish technicals, Litecoin is showing signs of a quiet comeback and Remittix , a newcomer with real-world payments utility, is gaining serious traction. Here, we’ll see why, if Bitcoin plays ball, these three may not just follow, they could lead the next leg up. Cardano could fly high if Bitcoin gives it wings Cardano (ADA) is flashing signs of bullish momentum, trading between $0.75 and $0.81 after a 14% weekly climb. Analysts project a June range of $0.791–$0.905, with bullish scenarios targeting $1.08–$1.47, if it can break above $0.85. However, a slip below $0.73 could pull ADA toward $0.50, especially if Bitcoin stumbles. Source: Bitpanda On-chain data and whale accumulation (over 420M ADA bought recently) support short-term price stability. Technologically, Cardano is advancing with its Ouroboros upgrade and Hydra Layer-2 scaling solution, while its Argentina partnership for lithium tokenization shows growing real-world use. Still, ADA’s fate is tightly linked to Bitcoin, with a 0.8–0.9 correlation. If BTC surges past $118,000, ADA could rally 25%–80%. But without BTC momentum or ecosystem catalysts like the Hydra launch, a major breakout remains uncertain. Cardano may soar, but only if Bitcoin lifts the tide. Litecoin may be down but not out Litecoin price action in mid-2025 tells a story of quiet resilience. After falling from $130 to as low as $71, LTC is regaining ground, trading between $71.57 and $100. Analysts forecast a June target of $117–$140, with bullish voices like Paulo Ricci eyeing $150 by July, assuming Bitcoin keeps climbing. Source: CoinCentral Behind the scenes, Litecoin is quietly evolving. The MWEB upgrade boosts its privacy and scalability, while rising hash rates and on-chain accumulation point to growing confidence. Institutional tailwinds, from Fidelity’s retirement accounts to Telegram’s payments integration, add fuel to the fire. If Bitcoin hits $118K, LTC could easily ride the wave to $120 or higher. Still, competition is fierce, and the Litecoin price needs more than nostalgia to soar. Without unique innovation or a fresh narrative, LTC’s breakout depends heavily on Bitcoin’s next move. Remittix is building what crypto always promised Imagine a digital design studio in Lagos working with clients from Berlin, Dubai and New York. Instead of fighting with unavailable Stripe support or eating wire fees, they integrate RemittixPay . Clients pay in fiat or crypto and Remittix handles the rest, converting to local currency and delivering it to their bank. Clean, compliant, no currency chaos. Is Remittix the Next XRP?! New 10X Potential Crypto?! This isn't just another payment tool, it’s infrastructure. Like Shopify for global commerce, Remittix gives creators and small businesses control. Its flat-fee crypto-to-fiat engine supports 100+ tokens and 30+ currencies, turning blockchain into a bridge, not a barrier. It’s as intuitive as online banking. No seed phrases, no Web3 jargon, just send, receive, withdraw. With Ethereum-linked momentum and BTC correlation near 0.8, a Bitcoin breakout to $118K could launch RTX toward $1.50. If crypto’s next wave is about real-world utility, Remittix might be riding its crest. Conclusion Bitcoin steers the crypto market and if it breaks out in June, Cardano, Litecoin and Remittix are poised to soar. Cardano’s tech upgrades and partnerships, Litecoin’s steady comeback and Remittix’s real-world payment utility could lead the next rally, if Bitcoin plays ball, these altcoins won’t just follow, they’ll lead.

2025-06-07T18:32:27,"Exploring Ethereum's Potential Surge and Its Impact on ERC20 Tokens","The cryptocurrency sphere is witnessing a pivotal shift with Ethereum positioned to potentially lead the next big market move. While Bitcoin has enjoyed its fair share of the spotlight, reaching new all-time highs, its momentum seems to be tapering off, possibly making room for Ethereum to take center stage. Ethereum's Bullish Prospects With Ethereum displaying strong bullish patterns, the ripple effect on associated ERC20 tokens could be substantial. In particular, tokens like ENA and Remittix may see enhanced activity and valuations owing to their foundational relationship with Ethereum's technology. Deceleration in Bitcoin's Market Activity Recent analyses suggest a slowing in Bitcoin's ascent. Despite hitting a record high of $112K, various technical indicators such as MACD and Rate of Change, signal a potential downturn which might cause investors to pivot towards other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. View the recent Bitcoin price movement on CoinMarketCap . Implications for ERC20 Tokens: ENA and Remittix ENA is currently showing potential as a buying opportunity despite recent price dips. This sentiment is primarily due to the overall strengthening of the Ethereum ecosystem which might support recovery in related tokens. Graphical insights into ENA's recent performance can be viewed on CoinMarketCap . Furthermore, Remittix stands out with its PayFi platform that bridges the gap between crypto and fiat currencies, simplifying transactions and reducing fees, which could attract considerable attention with Ethereum's rising tide. Remittix's Market Position and Future Outlook Remittix has already seen substantial presale activity, signaling strong market trust and interest. With Ethereum's expected surge, Remittix’s innovative solutions could push it to the forefront of ERC20 tokens, making it a preferable choice for investors looking to leverage Ethereum's growth.

2025-06-07T18:32:19,"Bitcoin Price Set To Cool Off But Ethereum Looks Ready To Explode, These ETH Tokens Are Seeing Huge Volume","The cryptocurrency market appears to be at a significant juncture, with a noticeable shift in momentum between its two largest assets. Bitcoin price recently set another ATH (again), but there are indications it is slowing down. Conversely, Ethereum is increasingly exhibiting bullish indicators, positioning itself for a substantial price surge. If Ethereum plays out and explodes, it will have a cascading effect on ERC20 tokens, specifically ENA and Remittix . Who will have a compounded effect of their positive outlook and the base layer Ethereum jump. Cooling Bitcoin Worries Market Several technical indicators are suggesting a deceleration in Bitcoin’s move. Although it made headlines again as it punched a new ATH, its MACD and ROC are pointing towards a downturn. Even the monthly RSI, though higher than expected, is still in neutral territory. The US BTCETFs also mirror the sentiment, with $268 million in outflow. Bitcoin price cooling off after hitting $112K ATH. Graph source: CoinMarketCap Some suggest BTC is just doing a normal retraction, while other analysts see BTC in a Tariff Trap . Coupling this with risks of higher inflation on the horizon, if the Bitcoin price doesn’t shake out of the cooling period soon, it can test the $100,000 floor and in a worse situation, go well below it. Ethereum's Ascending Technicals and Ecosystem Boost While the bull run had many traders disappointed with Ethereum’s performance, this finally seems to be changing. 20, 50 and 100 EMAs are all pointing towards a buying opportunity, supported by its 12 and 26 MACD. ETH price movement for 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap This technical narrative is further supported by ETF firms, where BlackRock and Fidelity dumped $180 million worth of BTC as it bled, and bought $78 million of ETH instead. EthereumCo-founder Buterin’s privacy advocacy on the Ethereum chain can also be a market mover, further strengthening Ethereum’s jump. What’s the verdict? Experts say Ethereum price can hit $4,000. Ethena On Recovery Ehtena (ENA) has experienced a pretty deep dive. Traders see the recent token unlock as the main reason, with supply flooding the market. Even with technical indicators like 10EMA and ROC showing a strong selling moment, savvy money is seeing this as a buying opportunity. ENA drop may be a buying opportunity. Source: CoinMarketCap With renewed interest in ETH, ERC20 tokens like ENA can ride the wave and recover losses. Pair that with rumors that Coinbase may list it, there is a flurry of buying activity. Remittix May Win The Race While all major ERC20 tokens can take advantage of the ETH predicted price boost, none will enjoy it more than Remittix . The PayFi protocol brings a whole new financial inclusion concept. It breaks the siloed nature of crypto and fiat, merging them into one. With seamless remittance of crypto into fiat, anyone with crypto can send traditional money to loved ones or even do grocery shopping where crypto is not accepted. The secret sauce?

2025-06-07T18:30:00,"These Cheap Altcoins Could Go Bananas if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its All-Time High Again","With Bitcoin (BTC) teasing a new all-time high, the spotlight is quickly shifting to undervalued assets that could ride the wave. Among the best cheap cryptos to buy now, Cardano (ADA) stands out, while still boasting one of the most robust ecosystems in the space. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is drawing attention with its DeFi-focused model and whispers of massive upside. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $10.1 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,700 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. If Bitcoin smashes through resistance and triggers another market-wide surge, these altcoins could be among the next cryptos to explode, offering huge potential for early investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today. Cardano Set to Surge if Bitcoin Breaks All-Time High A new all-time high for Bitcoin (BTC) could give Cardano (ADA) a strong push higher. Today, ADA is going for about $0.69 and it is a great choice for buying cheap crypto because of its strong background and continuous growth. Over time, ADA’s performance has been strongly linked to the large rallies in the Bitcoin market, during those rallies, ADA went from below $0.10 to $3. Because BTC price discovery is underway, ADA may reclaim the $1 mark and could surge to $1.20–1.50 if positive momentum appears in the altcoin market. Many investors trying to catch the next major cryptocurrency rise are likely to keep ADA on their watchlist. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is newly emerged and often bought for its high expected returns in the current bull trend. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $10 million and built a community of 11,700 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035. The early investors will achieve returns of up to 100%, with the token debuting at a price of $0.06. Increasing Credibility with Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s groundbreaking lending infrastructure is reshaping decentralized markets while cementing its reputation in the DeFi space. A huge milestone was achieved with the successful conduct of a smart contract audit by Certik, a move that drastically boosts investor trust. With this seal of approval, Mutuum Finance is now among the top crypto projects to watch. Leaderboard Feature Boosts Community Engagement To further tap into its users, Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard-based gamification featuring the top 50 token owners in real time. The leaders will receive bonus tokens, creating a fun, competitive way to drive more users up the board and remain there, combining social activity with DeFi strategy. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. If Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could see major gains. ADA is trading around $0.69 and has room to grow, especially if the broader market rallies. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in presale at $0.03, with over $10.1 million raised and 11,700 investors already in. Early buyers could see 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06.

2025-06-07T18:18:43,"Best Crypto to Buy Now With Global Mass Adoption Of Cryptocurrency Rising","Adoption was once a word loosely tossed around in crypto circles, used to spark hope more than signal reality. But that’s no longer the case. Now, both macro indicators and on-the-ground developments suggest that global acceptance is not just underway, it’s accelerating. Institutions are investing, while leading governments are adapting. Infrastructure is evolving. The most recent confirmation comes from a joint report by OKX and Blockworks Research, a result of extensive analysis and insights from industry heavyweights, including Polygon, Standard Chartered, and Google. It shows a significant uptick in crypto integration across finance, supply chains, and consumer industries. Global Indicators Show Crypto Is Embedding Itself Into the System The OKX–Blockworks report gets right into the facts by presenting hard data. Sixty percent of asset managers are reportedly planning to launch crypto investment products by 2026. Meanwhile, two-thirds of financial leaders are developing infrastructure for tokenized products. Institutional adoption, once a cautious experiment, is quickly becoming a strategic priority. Beyond banking, sectors like sports, fashion, and luxury goods are now applying blockchain for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and audience engagement. *Metaplanet Announces Accelerated 2025-2027 Bitcoin Plan**Targeting 210,000 $BTC by 2027* pic.twitter.com/xJKu3J8Apb — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 6, 2025 This trend is mirrored in state-level moves as well. Japan-based Metaplanet, already holding over 8,800 BTC, has revised its Bitcoin reserve target to a staggering 100,000 BTC by 2026. The rationale, as per a spokesperson, is that traditional safe havens are failing, and Bitcoin, with its limited supply and decentralized design, offers a more reliable anchor in a shifting global economy. Another country to join the bandwagon is Pakistan. Its newly appointed crypto minister is actively in talks with U.S. and Wall Street leaders, aiming to position the country at the forefront of blockchain innovation. These visits’ agenda included serious discussions with Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether-backed ventures, with commitments toward Bitcoin bonds and a strategic national reserve. Regulatory progress across major economies is aligning as well. From the UK’s maturing framework to the EU’s MiCA rollout and increasing policy integration in the U.S., the legal backbone for a crypto-driven financial world is slowly solidifying. For long-term investors, these aren’t just news events. They’re signs of a foundational shift worth positioning for. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presale Gems to Leverage Positive Market Sentiments While the market may be taking a hit right now with prices dropping, the macro trend suggests we are still in the bull run, which makes now an excellent time to stock up on projects with huge potential that are still priced at a nominal rate. Presales are excellent options for investors seeking such value, and we list some of the best options to consider in the space right now, considering their concepts, use case, and more. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces itself as an advanced Layer 2 solution looking to solve Bitcoin’s transactional limitations. It introduces a new protocol that allows users to move BTC onto a faster chain where transactions can be validated and settled with lower fees and greater efficiency. The framework integrates multiple scaling methods, including Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and Rootstock sidechains, while maintaining Bitcoin as the underlying asset. What makes Bitcoin Hyper distinct is that it does not replace or compete with Bitcoin. Instead, it enhances its utility by making it viable for high-frequency trading, micropayments, and faster peer-to-peer transfers. By using the Solana Virtual Machine for its smart contract infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper manages to bring scalability into a traditionally slow ecosystem without compromising security. Featured in videos of channels like Today Trader and more, its popularity has only skyrocketed in the past few days. The project is still in its presale phase, which means the infrastructure is in early development, but the roadmap points toward an interoperable environment that prioritizes usability and throughput. Bitcoin Hyper’s long-term growth potential hinges on whether it can become the go-to transaction layer for Bitcoin holders who want speed without sacrificing decentralization. As traditional systems begin to integrate tokenized services and faster settlements, a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 could find a solid use case. For users, this presents an opportunity to engage with Bitcoin in a more functional context while retaining the credibility of the base chain. SUBBD SUBBD is developing an infrastructure that centers around the creator economy, but with an approach that redefines ownership, monetization, and digital identity. It offers a token-based platform where creators can issue unique access rights, gated content, and on-chain audience engagement tools. This setup replaces traditional social media monetization models, which rely heavily on advertising and centralized revenue distribution. The $SUBBD token powers every transaction within the network, enabling creators to build their micro-economies without needing intermediaries. Subscription payments, limited-access merchandise, and voting systems for community decisions can all be implemented using smart contracts. The long-term objective is to create a circular economy that rewards both creators and their most active followers directly. This model is especially relevant in a digital environment where decentralized identity and blockchain-integrated content systems are gaining institutional attention. The OKX and Blockworks report highlighted how tokenized product infrastructure is becoming a focus for financial leaders. Platforms like SUBBD tap into this same technological direction but apply it to consumer engagement and digital media. In a climate where users are becoming more conscious of data ownership and fair compensation, SUBBD provides a framework that is both timely and needed. If successful, it could transform how people support creators, how content is licensed, and how engagement is rewarded, all while bypassing traditional gatekeepers. Its early presale pricing allows entry before utility expansion, making it a project of interest for those tracking real-world blockchain applications. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token anchors a multi-feature crypto wallet ecosystem that integrates advanced tools for portfolio tracking, secure storage, in-app swaps, and early access to presale tokens. It supports over 60 blockchain networks and uses a decentralized, non-custodial architecture to ensure user control over funds. In addition to wallet features, it includes a built-in DEX aggregator, market insights panel, and presale dashboard to help users discover and invest in upcoming projects. The wallet’s native token is designed to grant users exclusive access to higher staking yields, token launch allocations, and reward systems within the app. Its token utility is deeply connected to the broader usage of the app rather than external speculation. For instance, the more a user interacts with tools like the presale aggregator or the Best DEX, the more benefits they unlock through token holding. This model mirrors what many institutional frameworks are now shifting toward—fully integrated platforms that tie user activity directly to tokenized incentives. As firms explore tokenization across finance and user services, a wallet that links discovery, investment, and reward within one ecosystem becomes increasingly relevant. Best Wallet’s presale offers exposure to an infrastructure project already functioning at a public level but aiming to scale further. With crypto adoption rising and demand for self-custody solutions growing in response to both regulatory and institutional movement, utility-focused wallets may play a central role in onboarding new users securely and efficiently. Solaxy Solaxy’s Layer 2 blockchain enables efficient cross-chain activity between Ethereum and Solana. One may think of this as a Bitcoin Hyper-like project, but for a different blockchain. Also, rather than existing as a general-purpose L2, it has a defined objective, which is streamlining transactions for users who require the liquidity of Ethereum and the speed of Solana without being locked into one network. This approach allows users to bridge assets, execute smart contracts, and stake tokens across both chains in a single environment. The project’s token, SOLX, plays a central role in securing the network and rewarding validators. Users can stake SOLX to earn a share of protocol fees or participate in governance decisions that influence bridge parameters, transaction incentives, and protocol upgrades. For developers, Solaxy offers compatibility with Ethereum’s EVM and Solana’s Sealevel, allowing applications to run simultaneously across both ecosystems. $SOLX has got what YOU need. 🛸🪐45M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 This model aligns with ongoing conversations about blockchain interoperability. As adoption grows, the demand for networks that can manage liquidity and activity across different chains without increasing transaction costs is only going to rise. Solaxy aims to solve this by reducing friction in asset movement while preserving decentralization. It has already raised upwards of $45 million in what is one of the most successful presales this quarter and is set to launch soon. The regulatory trend, particularly in the EU and UK, is beginning to accommodate networks that serve as backbones for decentralized applications. With enterprise-grade compliance structures becoming more common, Solaxy’s cross-chain design could find relevance in a regulated market that favors scalable, interoperable, and low-cost infrastructure. For users and developers looking for technical reliability tied to practical use, the platform presents a strong case for growth through function, not speculation. Snorter Snorter is a trading bot project that integrates artificial intelligence with on-chain market signals to provide real-time automated decision-making for crypto traders. The system is designed for both experienced and casual users, offering different levels of control, from fully autonomous trading to customizable strategy overlays. Built on a decentralized framework, the bot operates without third-party custody, ensuring that trades are executed from the user’s wallet while maintaining full transparency. The technology relies on large-scale data parsing from various blockchains, price aggregators, and liquidity pools. This input is filtered through machine learning algorithms that continuously optimize for volatility detection, arbitrage potential, and trend shifts. Users can also access backtesting tools and detailed performance analytics within the dashboard to assess effectiveness over time. Snorter’s token is used for tiered access, governance proposals, and fee reduction. Holding more tokens allows access to premium indicators, faster execution lanes, and higher API request limits. It also enables community participation in refining AI models through a structured feedback mechanism, making the system adaptive over time. As the world moves to AI integration in finance, tools like Snorter could become essential for managing the increasing complexity of decentralized markets. As institutional players and regulators begin to recognize algorithmic trading in the blockchain space, AI-based bots that maintain decentralization and data sovereignty will have strategic importance. Snorter is positioned as a utility-first protocol in a segment where usability, performance, and control directly influence adoption. For traders seeking automation without compromise, it offers a focused solution. Conclusion Mass adoption of cryptocurrency is materializing through measurable actions from governments, financial institutions, and infrastructure providers worldwide. From strategic Bitcoin reserves to institutional-grade compliance platforms and tokenized financial products, the direction is clear. For investors, this phase represents a critical window—one where early engagement in credible, utility-driven initiatives may offer the most substantial long-term advantage.

2025-06-07T17:55:04,"Ether ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Toward $1B as Price Climbs Over 30%","Spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. have now posted 15 consecutive days of inflows, bringing them closer to a $1 billion milestone. On June 6, ETFs tied to Ether attracted another $25.3 million in inflows, according to data from Farside. This marked the third straight week of uninterrupted gains. Momentum Builds Since Mid-May The inflow streak began on May 16 and has now totaled $837.5 million. That figure accounts for about 25% of the $3.32 billion in net inflows since Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If current momentum continues, another $162.5 million in inflows would push the streak past the $1 billion mark. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw their own streak broken on May 29, when they recorded outflows totaling $346.8 million. Bitcoin ETF flows have since been mixed, showing both inflow and outflow days. Ether, meanwhile, has enjoyed strong price performance. Its price rose more than 31% over the last 30 days, currently trading around $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical Signals Point to $6K Potential Analysts remain optimistic about Ether’s long-term trajectory. Crypto Eagles, a well-followed technical analyst, suggested on June 3 that Ether’s current cycle mirrors past price patterns, possibly setting the stage for a rally toward $6,000. Ether last hit its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, per CoinGecko. Some market watchers believe that incorporating staking into spot Ether ETFs could be the next major development. This enhancement could significantly boost their competitiveness and investor appeal. Staking ETFs May Be on the Horizon Recent developments suggest staking options could soon arrive in the U.S. market. ETF provider REX Shares has filed to launch both Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, noted that REX used regulatory workarounds in an effort to bring these products to market. While no official launch date has been set, expectations are building. As Ether’s price strengthens and institutional interest grows, ETFs appear poised to become a dominant force in the asset’s adoption.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ether-etfs-extend-inflow-streak-toward-1b-as-price-climbs-over-30/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

After a sharp retrace alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is stabilizing above key demand levels, sparking cautious optimism among investors. Many are eyeing this zone as a potential launchpad for the next leg up, especially as the market seeks to recover and regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Despite recent uncertainty, sentiment around Solana remains constructive. Analysts point to strong structural support and a history of sharp rebounds from similar technical setups. Among them, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a key signal that has caught the attention of traders: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal for Solana on the daily timeframe. Historically, this signal has preceded notable price rallies, particularly when it aligns with strong support zones. With Solana holding firm and broader sentiment gradually improving, bulls are watching closely for a push into higher supply zones. If confirmed, a breakout from this range could send SOL toward new short-term highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Solana can sustain this momentum and lead the next altcoin rally. Solana Tests Support As TD Sequential Signals Rebound Solana is holding a critical support zone near $145 after shedding more than 20% of its value since late May. The correction has brought SOL into a key demand area, where bulls appear to be defending the level with strength. Despite attempts to reclaim $160, the altcoin has faced persistent resistance, with fading momentum and rising macro risks clouding short-term price action. Market-wide conditions haven’t helped either. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have stalled below key resistance zones, failing to spark a broader rally in altcoins. This hesitation has intensified uncertainty, with some analysts calling for a deeper retracement in SOL if market leaders continue to slide. However, others remain optimistic that Solana could soon turn the tide. A key signal for Solana has emerged, with analyst Martinez reporting that the TD Sequential indicator printed a buy signal on the daily chart. Historically, this indicator has been a reliable precursor to significant local bottoms and bullish reversals, particularly when seen near strong support levels. With SOL recently experiencing a selloff and now stabilizing, this signal underscores the growing bullish potential. For now, Solana’s ability to hold above $145 will be key. A bounce from this level, combined with improving sentiment across large-cap assets, could trigger a fresh push toward $160 and beyond. If confirmed, such a move would signal that SOL is regaining strength and ready to retest higher resistance levels in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally SOL Retests Support After Prolonged Correction Solana (SOL) is trading at $148.44 after attempting a modest rebound from its recent local low near $145. The daily chart shows that SOL has lost momentum since peaking above $180 in late May, marking a 20% correction. Price is now holding just above the 100-day moving average (144.68), a key technical level that previously acted as support during consolidation phases. The 50-day and 34-day moving averages are now trending downward, with the 50-day SMA around $159.33 and the 34-day EMA near $159.35 — both acting as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA remains higher at $177.49, reinforcing the presence of a strong overhead supply zone between $160 and $180. Despite the bearish pressure, volume has remained relatively muted during the recent drop, suggesting that panic selling hasn’t taken over yet. If SOL manages to hold above the $144–$145 region, this could form the base for a rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves.

2025-06-07T17:30:08,"Will Elon Musk Pick XRP Over Dogecoin For X Payments? Market Expert Answers","Market expert Joshua Dalton has given his opinion on what cryptocurrency the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is likely to pick for his X payments . Dogecoin has, for a while now, been rumored to be the crypto that will get the nod, but Dalton has explained why Musk might choose XRP instead. Musk Could Choose XRP Over Dogecoin In an X post , Dalton said he believes Elon Musk will do anything to make XRP a chosen one and use it, instead of Dogecoin, on X. The expert is confident that the world’s richest man will make this move, knowing that the Trump family will watch their crypto ventures and Bitcoin crash before their eyes. Dalton was alluding to the clash between Musk and Trump , in which the world’s richest man has openly criticized the US president over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill.’ The expert believes that Musk is likely to take a step further in his feud with Trump by choosing XRP, probably given the discord between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. The Trump family has shown their affinity for Bitcoin, with Eric Trump the co-founder of America Bitcoin, a BTC mining firm. The president’s company, Trump Media, recently raised $2.5 billion, which it intends to use to create a Bitcoin Treasury Reserve. Truth Social has also filed for a Bitcoin ETF. As such, Dalton predicts that Musk will choose to join the other side of the divide by picking XRP for his X payments rather than Bitcoin or Dogecoin. Interestingly, amid the Trump-Musk clash, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has urged the world’s richest man to go all in on BTC rather than picking XRP or any other crypto asset. He further encouraged Musk to allow Tesla to begin receiving payments in BTC while SpaceX can offer discounts on payments made with the leading crypto. Musk chose not to speak about XRP when he was asked about it during a Town Hall meeting last year . On the other hand, Musk once jokingly described ‘Bitcoin’ as his safe word, while Tesla holds over 11,000 BTC. Dogecoin is also in the mix for the X payments, given the world’s richest fondness for the meme coin. X Looking To Adopt Stablecoins Instead While the debate continues over whether Musk will choose XRP, Bitcoin, or Dogecoin for X payments, a Fortune report has revealed that the social media platform is exploring the use of stablecoins. The report stated that the firm is already holding early talks with crypto firms, including payment processor Stripe, about integrating stablecoins . Specifically, Musk and his platform are discussing how to integrate stablecoins into the payments app ‘X Money.’ The social media platform is said to view stablecoin adoption as a means to lower transaction costs and optimize cross-border payments. This raises questions about whether Musk will enable support for other cryptos, such as XRP or Dogecoin.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-over-dogecoin-for-x-payments/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|American Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin ETF|dogecoin|Elon Musk|Eric Trump|Joshua Dalton|meme coin|Samson Mow|SpaceX|Stablecoins|Stripe|Trump Media|Truth Social|X Payments|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T17:24:13,"Expert sets Bitcoin price for Q3 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be on track to reach a new all-time high in the third quarter of 2025, according to insights comparing its trading patterns to those of gold . In this case, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows highlighted this parallel, noting similarities between Bitcoin’s current price behavior and gold’s historical rally, he said in an X post on June 7. In his breakdown, Pillows explained that Bitcoin appears to follow the same sequence of market phases gold experienced before its major breakout. He noted that gold went through a distribution phase, followed by years of accumulation between 2013 and 2018. It then entered a re-accumulation phase after 2020, leading to a sharp rally to record highs of around $3,500. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to Pillows, Bitcoin is mirroring that path. After peaking in 2021, BTC underwent a steep correction, followed by an accumulation phase throughout 2022 and 2023. In 2024, Bitcoin entered what Pillows described as a re-accumulation phase, gaining momentum and breaking higher. If the pattern holds, it could enter a rally phase similar to gold’s before its surge. Pillows noted that both assets corrected after hitting new highs, reinforcing the comparison. To this end, the expert projects that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025. “BTC is perfectly mimicking Gold’s rally. Gold also had a correction after hitting the new ATH, and the same happened with BTC. I think BTC will hit $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025,” Pillows said. While the price patterns align, Bitcoin and gold remain fundamentally different. The precious metal is a centuries-old store of value, while Bitcoin is still evolving. Still, both have shown strong momentum in 2025. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch Meanwhile, a separate analysis by RLinda , published on TradingView on July 7, highlighted key Bitcoin technical levels to monitor. She noted that BTC is recovering after a liquidity sweep of nearly $100,000, though the short-term outlook remains mixed. While the broader trend is bullish, the market is in a corrective phase with a bearish structure below key resistance. Bitcoin is currently testing the $105,900 and $106,720 zones. If buying momentum weakens, a rejection here could drop the price to $103,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView However, RLinda noted that a sustained move above $105,500 could revive bullish momentum and push prices toward $110,400, assuming support holds. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,660, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The current price sits comfortably above its 50-day ($100,893) and 200-day ($87,224) simple moving averages ( SMA ), indicating continued bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 51.09, signaling neutral market conditions, with no immediate signs of the asset being overbought or oversold.

According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against the crypto exchange with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be brought again in the future. The filing notes that both companies will cover their own legal expenses. BiT Global had filed the lawsuit last year in the Northern District of California after Coinbase delisted the token over what it said was “unacceptable risk” that the tokenized BTC would “fall into the hands of Justin Sun.” Sun became affiliated with wBTC in August last year through a partnership, prompting Coinbase to question BiT Global about his role. Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has nevertheless been supporting the token, with World Liberty Financial dropping its cbBTC for wBTC after he joined as an advisor. The suit alleged the exchange’s decision was unjustified and harmed the token's liquidity and reputation while favoring Coinbase’s competing asset cbBTC.

2025-06-07T17:00:14,"Top Presale Crypto Projects: BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Snorter & Best Wallet Token Take the Lead","Presale crypto projects are drawing fresh interest in 2025, offering more than just hype. With utilities in place and early access pricing, many of these coins could see major gains after launch. From privacy-focused wallets to mining-enabled platforms, these early-stage cryptos are shaping a new wave of adoption. If you’re searching for the best performing crypto today, these presale crypto projects might be the best place to look. Each brings a unique utility, and they’re gaining traction fast. Here’s a look at BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Snorter, and Best Wallet Token and why they stand out. 1. BlockDAG – Hybrid Tech with Strong Mining Support BlockDAG is setting a new bar among presale crypto projects by mixing blockchain and DAG structures. This design allows for faster transactions and scalable performance. It also supports Ethereum tools and smart contract creation with low-code setup. Developers and users alike find it easy to access. Its mining features are just as impressive. BlockDAG miners, including the X1 mobile miner and X100 ASIC, are efficient and profitable. These devices can produce as much as 2,000 BDAG coins per day, helping both newcomers and advanced users. BlockDAG has now raised over $288.5 million and sold more than 22 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, marking a 2,520% return since batch 1. The current frozen price is $0.0018, valid until June 13, offering an even bigger 2,678% potential gain. The launch price is set at $0.05. So far, 17,700+ ASIC miners have been sold. With real-time mining activity and fast-growing adoption, BlockDAG is among the best performing crypto projects in the presale space. 2. BTC Bull – Built to Mirror Bitcoin’s Momentum BTC Bull is one of the few presale crypto projects designed to track Bitcoin movement while adding its own rewards twist. Traders are drawn to it for its gamified design, which includes incentive loops and events. This keeps activity high even when Bitcoin slows. With a presale price of $0.009 and over $5.6 million raised, BTC Bull is moving fast. Only a small portion of its supply is left, and that’s increasing the demand. Should Bitcoin surge again, BTC Bull could benefit directly. Those following the best performing crypto today see this project as a strong short-term prospect with fast action potential. 3. Snorter – Community and Fun Rolled Into One Snorter is shaking up the meme space by tying fun to real interaction. This presale crypto project rewards users for engaging in community activities like sharing memes and voting. The token has built-in deflationary mechanics and keeps value growing through activity. Now in its fourth presale stage, Snorter is priced at $0.00062 and has already raised $3.1 million. More features, such as SnorterBoards and meme battles, will go live after launch. Those seeking the best performing crypto today with low entry points and real engagement are giving Snorter a serious look. 4. Best Wallet Token – Privacy Meets Real Utility Best Wallet Token is focused on delivering actual services to users. As the native coin of a Web3 wallet, it covers everything from fiat on-ramps to built-in staking. Its main draw, though, is privacy. The wallet includes a stealth mode for masked transactions, which is timely as more users demand better protection. Currently in Stage 5 with a $0.0043 price tag, Best Wallet Token has raised more than $7.2 million. Early adopters will get higher APYs for staking in-wallet. If you’re checking the best performing crypto today based on use and privacy, this one has strong appeal. Key Insights With renewed focus on utility and strong entry prices, presale crypto projects are proving to be the hot picks of 2025. BTC Bull is capitalizing on Bitcoin trends, while Snorter adds community fun with real value. Best Wallet Token offers privacy-backed use, but BlockDAG continues to lead with $288.5 million raised, 22 billion coins sold, and fast-selling mining hardware. The GO LIVE reveal on June 13 will mark BlockDAG’s debut on 20 major platforms, positioning it well for growth. If you’re tracking the best performing crypto today, these four presales all deserve attention, but BlockDAG is clearly ahead of the curve.

According to a preliminary approval order , Illinois-based Midland States Bank will pay $3.125 million to settle accusations that the billion-dollar lender and two other banks it acquired improperly charged overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. Specifically, the class action lawsuit alleged that Midland States Bank by its practices engaged in “Breach of Contract and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unjust Enrichment, and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.” The two banks the lender acquired are Centrue Bank and Alpine Bank & Trust. Beneficiaries of the settlement will be customers of Midland State Bank, or the lenders it acquired, who had a checking account between April 8th of 2012 and April 30th of 2022. Plaintiffs could receive up to $10,000, per the settlement agreement. According to the preliminary approval order, the settlement Midland States Bank has reached with the plaintiffs is not an admission of guilt. Class members who wish to object to the settlement must communicate in writing to the court by August 11th. To opt out of the settlement, class members must write to the settlement administrator by the same date. A final approval hearing will be held on September 10th. Per the Federal Reserve, Midland States Bank held approximately $7.45 billion in total assets as of December of 2024.

2025-06-07T16:12:36,"UK Lifting Crypto ETF Ban May Not Boost Demand, Analyst Says","The United Kingdom is taking a big step in its approach to crypto ETFs and related investments. Announced on June 6, the government plans to lift the ban on retail investors buying Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to give more people access to crypto-based financial products. However, industry experts remain cautious about whether this change will significantly grow demand among UK retail investors. FCA’s Proposal to Open Crypto ETFs to Retail Investors The FCA recently proposed allowing retail investors to purchase crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). This high-risk investment type tracks the price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These ETNs will be listed on FCA-recognized exchanges, providing a new avenue for everyday investors to participate in the crypto market. The regulator emphasized that lifting the ban is part of a strategy to balance risk. The regulator wants investors to choose if these risky investments are right for them, instead of banning the product completely. This proposal follows shortly after BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, registered with the FCA as a crypto asset firm. This move signals growing institutional interest in the UK crypto market. Crypto ETFs See Global Adoption Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are becoming more popular worldwide, especially in the United States. U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have seen inflows for three weeks in a row, and recent data shows that more investors are starting to trust Ethereum-backed products. Also, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has gained strong interest from investors. Over two weeks, steady investments totaled more than $800 million. This comes as large firms and institutional investors continue to show growing interest in the financial investment vehicle . Analyst Says Retail Demand Likely to Stay Moderate Following the news, Eric Balchunas, an expert on ETFs at Bloomberg, shared his opinion. He said he does not expect the new rules to increase UK retail demand for crypto ETFs. He explained that European investors, including those in the UK, usually show less interest in crypto and ETFs than Americans. Balchunas noted that while the U.K. has experienced growth in crypto adoption , high fees on crypto products might eventually discourage investors. Nevertheless, some people in the industry feel hopeful. They think the FCA’s decision is important in giving UK investors more ways to invest in crypto. Although the UK crypto rules are becoming clear, it remains to be seen if more investors will take the chance on these new products or remain cautious.

MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.161. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops at $0.23. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus.

2025-06-07T16:00:11,"Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal – What To Expect Next","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of repeating a historic Golden Cross pattern that led to a long-term parabolic run. While the cryptocurrency’s recent pullback near the $100,000 region may have alarmed the crypto market, analysts suggest that this move is part of a broader trend that could push BTC to its next price high. Golden Cross Formation Pits Bitcoin At $150,000 Bitcoin has once again flashed a classic bullish signal, the Golden Cross, prompting renewed optimism for a major price rally in the coming months. According to a technical analysis by ‘Chain Mind,’ a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin may be on the verge of an explosive surge to $150,000 if this historical pattern plays out as expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over The last time BTC formed this pattern was in November 2024. Immediately after the cross’s completion, Bitcoin’s price experienced a 10% correction, followed by a sharp 62% rally over the next several weeks. This behavior established a clear trend of a short-term shake-out preceding a strong bullish continuation. Now, in early June 2025, Bitcoin has printed another Golden Cross on its chart, and so far, price action appears to be closely mirroring the one from the previous year. Notably, Bitcoin has dropped 8%, suggesting a smaller but comparable corrective phase to the one observed in 2024. Technical projections from Chain Minds now show a possible 51% rally on the horizon from the post-correction bottom. This would potentially place Bitcoin in the $150,000 range by the end of 2025. Notably, Chain Mind’s analysis identifies Bitcoin’s recent crash toward the $100,000 region as a potential local bottom, with the Golden Cross acting as the catalyst for the next leg of the bull run. If the current historical pattern holds, Bitcoin may be entering a sustained period of upward movement to new all-time highs. With the cryptocurrency already recovering from the brief downturn and now trading at $105,050, a 51% increase would potentially place its price at approximately $158,625 once the historical Golden Cross pattern is fully completed. Bitcoin Uptrend At Risk If $100,000 Level Is Lost Despite the broader bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, its price is currently navigating a critical trading range between $100,000 and $112,049, which analysts suggest is crucial for maintaining its current optimistic outlook. Crypto Fella, the market expert responsible for this analysis, has shown via a chart that BTC is consolidating within a rectangular band, reflecting a pause in momentum after a sharp upward move earlier in the quarter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That’s Forming The crypto analyst has boldly asserted that as long as Bitcoin continues to trade within the range above, there should be little cause for concern for another major crash. However, if the $100,000 mark fails to hold, the next likely target for downside movement is between $97,000 and $95,000, representing a 9.56% and 7.66% decline from current levels, respectively.

2025-06-07T15:56:40,"The $15 Investment That Could Make You Rich: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Changes Everything","In 2013, a $15 Bitcoin purchase didn’t mean much to most people. Today, that same buy would be worth hundreds of thousands. What those early adopters understood wasn’t just the idea of Bitcoin — it was the power of timing. Not hype. Not speculation. Mechanics. That moment may never return for Bitcoin. But it’s beginning again for Bitcoin Solaris. The Nova App, the project’s mobile-first mining gateway, allows anyone with a modern smartphone to contribute idle CPU and storage to earn BTC-S tokens. There’s no GPU farm, no locked staking. Just a device and a connection. Entry? As little as a few bucks. Turning Phones Into Earning Engines Bitcoin Solaris flips the mining model on its head. Where traditional networks depend on high-capital nodes and complex validator structures, BTC-S runs on an architecture optimized for everyday participation. Through the Nova App, phones run background operations that contribute to block validation. This creates yield not in theory, but in real time. Closed beta testers have already demonstrated the power of that simplicity, reporting consistent weekly earnings from passive phone usage alone. That kind of performance isn’t common in new-layer protocols. It’s even rarer when it happens before exchange listings. And with phase 6 of the presale active at $6 per token, even small investments today open the door to protocol-level rewards — without the usual bottlenecks or dependencies. What Makes This Model Work? Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t scale through brute force. Its strength comes from separation of function. The base layer secures the network through a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity — mechanisms that keep energy costs low while maintaining robust consensus. On top of that, the Solaris Layer processes transactions with Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time, two clock-based systems designed for speed and precision. That separation allows the network to reach over 10,000 transactions per second without congestion. Finality settles in around two seconds. These figures aren’t ideal conditions or load-tested projections. They reflect what the system is engineered to maintain under real usage. And because the design limits the burden placed on individual devices, it opens the door for phones to play a role in consensus. This approach solves a long-standing issue in blockchain design. Most networks either require validators with constant uptime or miners with high hashpower. Both models create entry barriers. Bitcoin Solaris avoids that by shifting emphasis from raw output to consistent, verifiable contribution. When a phone provides idle storage or computing bandwidth, it’s supporting the system. That support is measured and rewarded through direct token distribution. Audited, Verified, and Fully Transparent Security isn’t a footnote in the Bitcoin Solaris model. It’s central. The Nova App has already passed a full Freshcoins audit , confirming its technical architecture, mining logic, and efficiency assumptions. On the protocol level, Cyberscope completed a comprehensive code review of smart contracts and consensus structures. And team identity verification has been completed through KYC documentation , adding another layer of accountability. This is the kind of transparency that simply doesn’t exist in early-stage mobile projects. And according to Crypto Volt’s breakdown , that’s exactly why Bitcoin Solaris stands out in a saturated landscape of speculative coins and hype-based launches. The Tokenomics That Lock In Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has a hard cap of 21 million tokens. That figure isn’t symbolic — it defines the economics of the entire network. No additional tokens will ever be minted. No emissions curve, no inflation schedule, and no backend wallet allocations. The rules are fixed, and that certainty shapes every decision around acquisition and participation. Out of the full supply, 4.2 million BTC-S are allocated to the presale. That’s a one-time distribution window — not a recurring release. Anyone buying in now is acquiring tokens before broader network access, before centralized exchange liquidity, and before the mining rollout scales competition. It’s not just about getting a better price — it’s about starting with a stronger position. At $6 during phase 6, early buyers are operating at a fraction of the exchange listing benchmark, which is targeting $20 based on network growth and liquidity provisioning. But more importantly, holding tokens at this stage isn’t passive. Once the Nova App goes live, those tokens secure access to mining rewards. Early accumulation leads to early earnings — and in a system built on capped supply, that advantage doesn’t level out over time. It compounds. This model rewards participation, not speculation. Price movement may draw attention later, but the real economic value is already forming through protocol access. Each user entering now locks in a role before the wider market shifts the balance. Crypto Isn’t Dead. Access Was. Until Now. The barriers that once defined crypto access don’t apply here. $15 — the cost of just a few BTC-S tokens — gives users a real position in an operational mining ecosystem. The Nova App turns idle smartphone resources into income. The device you already own becomes a functional part of the protocol. Beta testers running early versions of the app reported earnings that rivaled — and in some cases outperformed — browser-based miners and leading staking platforms. The difference is accessibility. Instead of tying rewards to who has the most capital or tech knowledge, Bitcoin Solaris ties them to contribution. That’s what makes the $15 entry point meaningful. It’s not a lottery ticket or a speculative flyer — it’s a working gateway into the protocol’s economy. The earlier you start, the more you compound returns before broader network demand increases competition and shifts pricing.

2025-06-07T15:45:51,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $105,000 As Markets Recover","Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $105,000, making a strong recovery after dropping to an intraday low of $101,201 on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2%, trading around the $105,071 mark. BTC’s drop to $100,000 wiped out over $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours as traders rushed to sell. Analysts believe BTC’s decline has been sustained by long-term holders locking in their profits. Bitcoin (BTC) Turns Bearish Amid Political Tensions Bitcoin (BTC) dipped sharply on Friday, plunging 3% to hit a low of $100,421 as political tensions between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk escalated. However, it has recovered since, regaining its position above $105,000. The price action reflects increased volatility across crypto after an acrimonious escalation of tensions between President Trump and Musk. The tensions triggered a risk-off sentiment heading into the weekend as the global crypto market cap plunged over 4%, and Bitcoin fell to $100,000, with market watchers sweating over a further decline. According to data from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, the Binance net taker volume fell from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours, indicating a sharp change in investor sentiment. The analyst emphasized that this was the largest intraday net-taker volume reversal observed on the exchange this year. The shift shows how quickly sentiment changes if influential figures or macro-narratives dominate headlines. Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action Bitcoin has recovered after Thursday’s dip, rising back above $105,000 during the ongoing session. While BTC has recovered, the broader crypto market is still digesting the fallout. However, CryptoQuant analysts have pointed out another factor that could decide the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the amount of BTC transferred to exchanges. Miner-to-exchange inflows crossed $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. These inflows are often seen as a proxy for miners’ preparing to sell their holdings. This could significantly impact BTC’s short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to the flagship cryptocurrency’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. “Paying close attention to these inflows—especially during historical peaks like the current phase—can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Thursday, falling to an intraday low of $100,421 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. Sentiment turned bearish following an ugly spat between President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. However, the decline was short-lived as BTC rebounded on Friday to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,378. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but has declined and is currently trading around $104,799. Despite the decline, analysts believe a pullback was expected and could trigger a move to fresh all-time highs. According to an analysis, BTC follows a similar path after each halving. The analyst pointed out that BTC rose around 280% a year after the 2016 halving and 550% a year after the 2020 halving. During the current cycle, BTC has climbed around 70% since the halving. According to Klarch, price action has picked up after a slow start during previous cycles, indicating there is more room for growth. According to the analyst, BTC’s recent all-time high is a milestone that marks the beginning of a move higher. BTC has multiple tops before it hits the cycle’s real peak. BTC started the previous week positively but was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,834.

Gemini Confidentially Files for US IPO Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss brothers, has disclosed it confidentially filed for an IPO as crypto exchanges attempt to take advantage of renewed market momentum. Several high-profile companies, including crypto exchanges, have launched successful listings, indicating growing demand and renewed vigor in the capital markets. Recently, USDC issuer Circle went public, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital, stated, “Pre-IPO crypto companies would be crazy not to move ahead with listings after seeing how Circle traded. Crypto can be an unpredictable market, so when you get a chance like this, you take it.” The recent spate of IPOs heralds a turning point for the industry, reflecting growing confidence among digital asset firms to attract mainstream investors. It also suggests companies are confident about meeting transparency, regulatory, and capital requirements. Gemini has not determined the size or the proposed range for its offering. Kat Liu, vice president at IPOX stated, “Gemini's move contributes to the broader momentum and reinforces the idea that crypto-native firms are increasingly preparing to access public markets. More broadly, this signals that long-anticipated firms are now ready to reengage with public capital.” Singapore’s Ousted Crypto Firms Have Nowhere To Go Singapore recently passed an order prohibiting unlicensed crypto firms from serving overseas customers. The order marks the beginning of the end for regulatory loopholes in the blockchain industry. The directive, issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, orders crypto firms offering services abroad to get licensed or leave. The movie aligns with a broader global push for compliance and cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing. Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Blockchain Alliance, stated, “For exchanges still playing regulatory pinball — constantly seeking loopholes to avoid licensing requirements — the reality is clear: They will soon find themselves having to relocate to their favorite destination, the moon. With jurisdictions like Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, Hong Kong, and others tightening oversight and closing gaps, there’s simply no escaping the global push for compliance.” Some in the crypto space have interpreted the recent order as a sharp policy reversal. However, the regular said it has always maintained a steady stance. Singapore’s Central Bank stated, “MAS’ position on this has been consistently communicated for a few years since the first response to public consultation issued on February 14, 2022, and in subsequent publications on October 4, 2024, and May 302025.” Dow Jones Rises On Back Of Strong Market Data Wall Street ended the week positively after better-than-expected job numbers boosted investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443 points, leading Friday’s gains among major indices. The S&P 500 rose 1.03% to close above 6000 for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2% thanks to a major rebound in tech stocks. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US added 139,000 jobs in May, above the expected 125,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, while the wage growth also came in higher than expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from Thursday’s dramatic decline to register an increase of nearly 3% on Friday and recoup a significant chunk of the previous day’s losses. The flagship cryptocurrency has extended its gains in the current session and has reclaimed $105,000 to trade around $105,150. Analysts believe miner activity could impact BTC’s near-term outlook. According to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, miners have increased the volume of BTC transferred to crypto exchanges. According to the analysis, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. Analysts view such inflows as a proxy for miners intending to sell their assets. This could impact short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to BTC’s spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. BTC started the previous week positively, registering a marginal increase on Monday. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662.

2025-06-07T15:35:50,"Outset PR Reports LATAM Crypto Media Reach Becoming Centralized in Q1 2025 as 73% of Outlets Lost Traffic","In the first quarter of 2025, Latin America’s crypto media ecosystem had one of its roughest stretches in recent memory. New research from Outset PR, an agency known for its data-driven, boutique approach to PR in Web3 , shows that 73% of active crypto news outlets in the region saw traffic decline in Q1 2025. Just six crypto-native publications accounted for 69% of total traffic across the crypto-only segment. The report — based on SimilarWeb data from 55 tracked LATAM media sites — paints a stark picture of media contraction. Once-reliable names lost ground, some disappearing from the radar altogether. Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s January rally and early-year bullish momentum didn’t translate into sustained audience growth. Instead, a mix of macro headwinds, market corrections, and Google’s March algorithm update created a perfect storm, hitting crypto-focused sites hardest — especially those lacking strong SEO strategies or diversified content models. Media Instability Escalates Amid Market Turmoil In January 2025, Bitcoin briefly surged past $109,000, fueled by institutional inflows and broader optimism around U.S. economic policy. But the rally proved short-lived. By February, a wave of exploit-driven panic, meme coin collapses, and shaky sentiment pulled the market into a sharp correction. The downturn hit the media landscape just as hard. Advertising budgets contracted, user interest waned, and Google’s March 2025 algorithm update wiped visibility from many LATAM-focused crypto outlets — especially those relying on outdated SEO tactics or thin content. According to Outset PR’s tracking , 21.8% of the 55 monitored outlets gained traffic in February, while a staggering 78.18% saw declines. Performance snapshot of LATAM crypto outlets in February 2025, as reported by Outset PR Google’s March Update Creates a Visible Divide March brought more instability — both in markets and media. Bitcoin spent most of the month fluctuating between $83,000 and $94,000, with modest rebounds tied to renewed institutional interest and broader macro optimism. Amid price swings, crypto readers turned to the media for clarity. But just as visibility was needed most, Google’s March core algorithm update reshaped how regional publishers ranked in search. The update hit LATAM outlets unevenly. According to Outset PR, 24 of 55 active crypto-focused sites regained some traffic by the end of March. But most remained below their January baselines. Outset PR data showing March 2025 traffic trends for LATAM crypto media A sharp divide emerged: agile players optimized quickly and adapted, while others continued their downward spiral. Notably, CryptoNews Brasil went offline entirely for Brazilian users , likely due to government-imposed access restrictions tied to new regulations targeting offshore betting platforms. The site remains accessible in Europe, but its LATAM visibility has vanished. Finance News Sites Outrank Crypto-Native Brands in Traffic, But Offer Limited Crypto Depth According to the report, all the top Latin American media sites with crypto coverage are web portals for finance and general news. They regularly got millions of visits but mentioned crypto mostly during periods when it was on an uptrend — losing interest when the hype died down. The bulk of these platforms operate in Brazil and Argentina , and they make many content choices based on trends in their countries' politics and economies. Therefore, their reports about crypto can be inconsistent. Though macro trends may bring exposure for crypto-based content on these general sites, they typically do not provide the ongoing and meaningful connection that crypto-native platforms can. Six Crypto-Native Outlets Dominate LATAM Visibility A key insight from Outset PR’s Q1 report is the extreme concentration of visibility in the region. Despite the vast number of sites tracked, just six publications accounted for 69.13% of total crypto-native traffic. Q1 2025 media tier segmentation for LATAM crypto outlets, sourced from Outset PR Together, these six outlets drew 4.11 million visits across the quarter. They were the only crypto-native sites to consistently surpass the 400,000 monthly average visits. Their dominance highlights the narrowing field of reliable crypto voices in LATAM, especially as newer or mid-sized players struggle with traffic volatility and indexing issues. The next tier captured traffic in the 130K–270K range. While still influential, these outlets represent a sharp drop in reach. Most fall short of driving large-scale visibility for crypto projects without additional amplification. Beneath this, Outset PR categorized the remaining outlets as long-tail players. Fourteen of them attracted fewer than 10,000 monthly visits. Though potentially useful for SEO or niche audiences, these sites now contribute minimal impact in terms of direct reach. Strategic Takeaways for LATAM Crypto Media Both the size and influence of Latin America’s crypto media landscape are shrinking — and consolidating. What once felt like a sprawling ecosystem is now concentrated in the hands of a few players. Outset PR’s report underscores how quickly visibility can shift. In fast-moving markets like LATAM, media influence doesn’t erode gradually — it can collapse in a matter of weeks. And influence today is about how often an outlet gets indexed, how visible it is in algorithm-driven feeds, whether its audience is real, and how quickly it publishes.

2025-06-07T15:15:06,"$31M Bitcoin Donation to Ross Ulbricht Traced to AlphaBay, Not Silk Road","Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace who was granted clemency by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, received a whopping $31 million Bitcoin donation from an anonymous wallet over the previous weekend. The sizable gift, sent less than five months after Ulbricht’s sentence was commuted, immediately sparked speculation that he had covertly reclaimed old Silk Road earnings. Anonymous Bitcoin Gift to Ross Ulbricht According to the intel shared by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis with WIRED, the 300 BTC donation did not originate from Silk Road at all. Instead, the funds appear to trace back to AlphaBay, a now-defunct darknet market that operated between 2014 and 2017, well after Silk Road’s takedown. AlphaBay, which was reportedly ten times the size of Silk Road at its peak, was known for trafficking in drugs, malware, and illegal services. Phil Larratt, Chainalysis’s director of investigations and a former UK law enforcement official, said there are “reasonable grounds to suspect” the Bitcoin came from someone involved with AlphaBay – likely a former vendor, given the size of the amount. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who had earlier examined the donation, also concluded the funds did not come from Silk Road. Despite the sender’s use of Bitcoin mixing services, ZachXBT traced the BTC to a wallet previously flagged by Chainalysis as connected to illicit activity. He shared his conclusion with WIRED, wherein he noted that the donation itself may be genuine, but “not legitimate funds.” Additional clues suggest the person behind the transfer may have been actively trying to avoid detection: ZachXBT discovered the same individual had previously cashed out other crypto through centralized exchanges in small, spread-out amounts, rather than large single transactions. This behavior is consistent with an effort to evade asset freezing or scrutiny. AlphaBay Crackdown Chainalysis reportedly declined to share specifics on how exactly it linked the donation to AlphaBay. But it is important to note that the firm is widely known for its expertise in mapping illicit activity across blockchain networks and played a crucial role in dismantling the now-defunct marketplace during the multinational law enforcement initiative known as Operation Bayonet, involving the FBI, DEA, and Europol. The crackdown later led to the conviction of Bryan Connor Herrell, an AlphaBay moderator, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison. As for Ulbricht, he has not publicly addressed the donation.

The series aims to push creative boundaries by offering a crypto prize instead of cash. The show launches amid rising security risks for crypto holders, with several high-profile kidnapping attempts reported this year. Netflix’s latest reality venture, House of Streams, is set to debut on June 18 in the UK and Ireland, offering a unique prize, 1 Bitcoin, to the winning contestant. The show will feature eight online streamers with a combined following of four million. According to the official website, the participants, many of whom are well-known on Twitch, will compete in a series of challenges for a chance to take home the Bitcoin, valued at over $104,000 at press time. Why Did Netflix’s New Series Choose Bitcoin Over Cash? While the production is backed by the Malta Film Commission, it remains unclear why the series opted for a crypto prize over traditional rewards. Creator Mark Holland reportedly said the prize “couldn’t have been a simple cash prize or a trip to the Maldives,” hinting at an intent to push boundaries. The show’s producers have also cautioned against scams. A statement released on May 22 clarified, “We support Bitcoin and no other memecoin,” after reports emerged of individuals attempting to launch fraudulent tokens under the show’s name.

Netflix’s Crypto Show Launches as Security Risks for Holders Rise The show comes amid growing concerns over the risks faced by crypto holders. In May 2024, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was rescued from captivity after French police stormed a suburban Paris location. The suspects had severed one of the victim’s fingers , echoing earlier high-profile attacks involving physical mutilation and digital wallets. Last month, Pierre Noizat, founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, saw his own family targeted. A group of masked men attempted to abduct Noizat’s daughter and grandson in broad daylight. The assault was foiled when the victims and a bystander managed to fight off the attackers. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

After returning to his apartment, the victim was ambushed at gunpoint by three teenagers from Florida. The assailants forced him into their vehicle, covered his head with a towel, and warned him not to look at them. They drove him over 70 miles to a remote desert near White Hills, Arizona. These incidents have intensified calls for better protection for those tied to the crypto world, particularly as rising asset values make high-profile figures more attractive targets.

2025-06-07T14:50:55,"Garantex Moves $15M Despite Tether Freeze, Data Shows","Despite a widely publicized asset freeze by Tether and coordinated sanctions across the world, Russian crypto exchange Garantex has managed to transfer millions of digital assets on the blockchain — demonstrating acute loopholes in the efficacy of crypto blacklists and asset-freezing regimes. According to a recent news report by blockchain forensics firm Glass Ledger, over $15 million worth of reserves linked to Garantex has been actively transferred since March, staying off blacklists by hopping between chains, using mixers like Tornado Cash, and exploiting successor platforms like Grinex. The drama began early in March, when US, German, and Finnish regulators froze $27 million of USDT held by Garantex as part of a sweeping crackdown on the sanctioned exchange. Tether's freeze, which was implemented at the smart contract level, was hailed as a crypto compliance milestone, with regulators trumpeting it as proof that digital assets can be made subject to on-chain blacklists. Garantex, in turn, directly accused Tether of ”declaring war on the Russian crypto market” and shut down temporarily, but first threatened customers it had ”solutions” for individuals with BTC and ETH. How Garantex Funds Kept Moving Later on-chain information revealed that the freeze was only the tip of the iceberg of a new cat-and-mouse game. One of the long-dormant Garantex Ethereum wallets that first raised the eyebrows of compliance experts was revived in March and collected over 3,200 ETH before it flowed $2.3 million through Tornado Cash, a highly respected decentralized mixer used to launder dirty money. The same wallet now holds $6.1 million worth of ETH, while other funds are moved on the Bitcoin and BNB blockchain. Notably, 2.2 BTC was bridged to Tron and partially sent to Grinex, which is the platform commonly regarded as Garantex's operational successor. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun summed up the dilemma: ”The Garantex case bursts the bubble of control so many still carry. $15 million freely available through dark chains and mixers is not a breakdown of law — it's a breakdown of sanction enforcement.” Their latest report details how Garantex exploited the delay between freeze statements and enforcement as well as the inherent limitations of blacklists in the multi-chain universe. The investigative trail doesn't end there. Grinex, now suspected of appropriating Garantex's infrastructure and base of customers, has moved over $1.6 billion on international exchanges in just a few weeks, according to our reporting at Global Ledger. Some of these flows directly or with intermediate hops to major regulated exchanges — raising the red flags of compliance and highlighting the danger even for platforms that have KYC and AML guidelines set up. In one case, $191,000 of USDT was sent directly from a wallet linked to Grinex to a top global exchange, and another $500,000 transfer ended up at an EU VASP in just a single intermediary wallet. What's behind these transactions? Forensic analysts pinpoint several factors: blacklist-based freezing's limitations, delays in operations in Tether's multi-signature freeze mechanism (up to 44 minutes at times, long enough for bad guys to execute withdrawals prior to the freeze taking effect), and Garantex's tactic of hot wallet rotation, use of less-regulated blockchains, and use of cross-chain bridges in order to remain one step ahead of enforcement mechanisms. Besides, Garantex's operating trends changed rapidly following sanctions: they changed address clustering, rerouted transactions to Asian exchanges like HTX and OKX, and began rotating hot wallets more frequently — daily sometimes to evade detection. Compliance Challenges and Industry Response Compliance experts now insist that exchanges go beyond the simple blacklist screening. ”You require real-time blockchain analytics, behavioral risk scoring, and active transaction monitoring,” a leading AML consultant said. ”Otherwise, sanctioned players will always find a way through.” Exchanges are also requested to strengthen onboarding due diligence, flag high-risk flows from known mixers or successor entities, and cooperate with forensics firms for timely identification. The Garantex case has once more fueled controversy surrounding the utilization of decentralized cross-chain bridges and mixers in enabling illicit finance. Although some suspect that mixers have a valid purpose for privacy, their adoption by criminals and sanctioned entities is currently surpassing the industry's ability to freeze and monitor assets, critics argue. The appearance of services such as Grinex, essentially a rebranded Garantex, demonstrates how quickly criminals can adapt, bringing technology and userbases along with them in order to evade enforcement.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9479/garantex-moves-15-m-despite-tether-freeze-data-shows,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT","News|Security",cryptocompare

The Treasury says the $10 billion operation is designed to repurchase securities maturing between July 15th, 2025 and May 31st, 2027. Buybacks allow the Treasury to retire outstanding debt early, potentially reducing interest costs and adjusting its debt profile. This big buyback comes as rising yields increase borrowing costs, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continuing to keep interest rates higher-for-longer. In an April interview with Bloomberg , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about foreign nations fueling a bond market selloff, pointing instead to investors unwinding leveraged positions. At the same time, Bessent specifically called out the Treasury’s ability to increase its buyback program if necessary. When asked whether he’s discussing concerns about the stability of the Treasury market with Powell, Bessent dismissed the notion that there’s any cause for alarm. “Specifically, did we discuss some kind of a break the glass? I think we’re a long way from that.” Historical records indicate the Treasury’s previous largest buyback happened in 2000, at approximately $3 billion.

2025-06-07T14:30:01,"Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says","According to social media buzz, the growing clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the crypto world. Musk’s public swipe at a recent spending bill kicked things off. Then came Trump’s warning to yank Musk’s government contracts. It got messy fast. And now, some believe XRP could come out on top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Elon Musk-Trump Feud Spurs Crypto Talk Musk took to Twitter on June 4 to slam what he called reckless government spending. His post warned of “serious economic risks.” Not long after, Trump fired back. He threatened to pull subsidies and contracts tied to Tesla. That response sent Tesla’s stock tumbling. Investors watched $150 billion in market value vanish in a matter of hours. Market Moves And Price Swings Based on reports, Bitcoin slid more than 5% following the news. It dropped to a low of $100,550 before finding a bit of footing near $102,400. XRP wasn’t spared either. It fell alongside other major coins, though the exact drop varied across exchanges. Traders saw quick declines, then a modest rebound as the dust settled. I believe @elonmusk will do anything to make @Ripple $XRP as a chosen one and use it on @x while knowing that @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and @realDonaldTrump will watch @worldlibertyfi and @bitcoin crashing in front of their eyes. Right, @elonmusk? — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) June 5, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Joshua Dalton, who founded tech services firm TRIBLU, stirred the pot with a bold claim. He suggested Musk might choose XRP as the main currency for X’s upcoming payment system, X Money. Dalton argued that Musk “will do anything” to make XRP the go-to token. He tagged Ripple, Musk, US President Trump, and Trump’s sons in a single post. That move framed the drama as more than just politics—it became a showdown of crypto loyalties. Technical Fit For X Money XRP provides quicker settlement and reduced fees than Bitcoin. In 2021, Musk suspended BTC payments for Tesla due to high energy consumption and centralized mining concerns. That move proved he’s not afraid to change course when a coin isn’t aligned with his objectives. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger In October 2024, Musk even referenced XRP in a viral video. He spoke of crypto like XRP potentially resisting central control, but he did not go so far as to make a full endorsement. With X Money scheduled to roll out later in 2025, XRP’s architecture for cross-border transfers could mirror what Musk is looking to create. Some analysts point out real hurdles. Ripple still holds a large chunk of XRP, and US regulators are watching closely. Any big move would need legal green lights and deep liquidity on exchanges. But for now, the idea of an “everything app” powered by XRP keeps popping up in crypto chats.

2025-06-07T14:22:16,"XRP ETF Approval Odds Soar Past 92% As Plans For $300M Startegic XRP Reserve Submitted To SEC","Polymarket data shows XRP ETF approval odds have surged above 92%. This boom reveals growing hope that the US SEC will approve an XRP ETF by 2025. Applications filed by major asset managers add pressure on a decision-making process. As institutional interest grows, traders are noticing new presale altcoins. Discover why these events are important for the XRP ecosystem as well as the best substitute for XRP that draws in investors below. Source: fxstreet.com XRP ETF Approval Odds Soars Past 92% The likelihood of a US SEC allowing a spot XRP ETF has increased to 93% over the last month. Data from Polymarket indicates that since early May, approval chances have risen by 20%. Several big asset managers have given things more impetus. Bitwise, applications have been sent in by Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary Capital. Every lawsuit strains the SEC to act swiftly. Source: Kenny Nguyen on X Additionally, the recent XRP futures ETF launches by CME Group and Coinbase Derivatives have been helpful. Mid-May saw both products go live with notable institutional appetite and trading volume. This is evidence, according to analysts, that markets are ready for more controlled XRP products. Legal developments around Ripple also matter. The continuous settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped to reduce ambiguity. Although a definitive agreement is not yet in place, recent court decisions and regulatory signals point to XRP possibly not being considered a security. This legal clarity has changed investor mood and raised approval chances. Now with odds above 92%, insiders see a likely SEC nod for an XRP ETF. Many anticipate a surge in inflows akin to past Bitcoin ETF releases should approval come about. This can inspire greater acceptance and direct fresh capital into XRP investment platforms. Although analysts are still wary about timing, the general agreement is that: The year 2025 looks to be the one for a spot XRP ETF. $300M Strategic XRP Reserve Submitted to SEC Seeking $300 million for an XRP-focused Treasury, Webus International Limited registered a Form 6-K with the SEC. Signing a joint venture with Samara Alpha Management, the Hangzhou-based company established a crypto reserve for payments made using Ripple. For its booking system and chauffeur services, Webus intends to handle quick cross-border payments with XRP. This action conforms to the strategy of renewable energy company VivoPower to create a $121 million XRP reserve and BitGo’s validation of a $100 million initial investment. From the futures market, where Coinbase Derivatives and CME Group debuted XRP futures ETFs in May, institutional curiosity in XRP has extended. Analysts from U.Today point out this trend as a major indicator that large corporations value diversifying outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Remittix: The New XRP Replacing XRP as the Best PayFi System Remittix (RTX) —-a presale crypto on Ethereum–might take front stage as the best PayFi option over XRP. Remittix allows anyone to send crypto and get local money in more than 30 countries without additional charges unlike XRP. Close to $15.5 million has been raised thus far from Remittix’s token presale; analysts estimate a 50x increase when the network opens. Although XRP ETFs show promise, Remittix could be quite helpful for regular payments and company use. Apart from its great use, Remittix has a low entrance point at $0.0781, hence its ROI is higher than XRP. Remittix is also expected to strike exchanges shortly, hence its price is about to soar violently. Final Words Anticipation is at an all-time high as XRP ETF odds exceed 92% and Webus’s $300 million reserve plan formalizes XRP’s part in payments. Still, Remittix is one improvement on XRP ETF products. Remittix provides low fees, PayFi tools, and simple local cash conversion. Remittix might be a better and more useful tool for traders and companies than conventional XRP approaches. Keep an eye on Remittix if you wish to keep ahead since it seeks to surpass XRP ETF in crypto-to- fiat payment systems.
