2025-06-06T22:36:18,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June – Bitcoin, Solana, XRP","Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins —Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them—have each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let’s explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World’s Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world’s biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto’s flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto’s future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto’s $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL’s appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76—up 1% in the last 24 hours—mirroring Bitcoin’s brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple’s Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple’s XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP’s retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin’s 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The project’s primary goal is to empower content creators with greater earnings potential, increased control over their work, and reduced reliance on tech giants that typically claim large commission cuts.

2025-06-06T22:01:17,"Republican Senator Josh Hawley Breaks With Party Lines, Opposes Upcoming GENIUS Act: Report","Senator Josh Hawley is opposing party lines by voting against an upcoming stablecoin bill endorsed by the White House. According to a New York Times report , the Missouri Republican Senator is saying “no” to the upcoming GENIUS Act. “It’s a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don’t see why we would do that.” According to the Times report, the GENIUS Act could potentially upend the credit card industry and benefit both Trump and Musk, who are currently publicly feuding . Hawley is pushing for amendments to the bill that would curtail Big Tech’s involvement. GENIUS is an acronym meaning “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins”. The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion. Yesterday, the second-biggest player in the US-dollar pegged stablecoin space, Circle, issuer of USDC, launched its initial public offering, or IPO. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL.” In its New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) debut, Circle saw an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the IPO price of $31 per share.

2025-06-06T21:01:33,"Crypto Regulation Shake-Up: SEC Wins $1.1M Fraud Case as California Trials Bitcoin Fees","This week in crypto regulation, U.S. lawmakers and state officials drew attention across the digital asset sector with developments ranging from delayed disclosures and enforcement criticisms to landmark crypto-friendly legislation in California. The regulatory environment continues to evolve, sometimes sharply divided between federal hesitations and state-level innovation. Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure In a striking development, Texas Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) came under fire for failing to disclose his Bitcoin purchases in a timely manner . Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) is under fire for allegedly improperly disclosing recent Bitcoin transactions. #BrandonGill #DonaldTrump https://t.co/JbID89ntiW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 According to a report from Open Secrets, Gill bought between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin on January 29 and February 27. However, the disclosures didn’t appear until May 30—well beyond the 45-day window mandated by the STOCK Act, which is designed to prevent insider trading by public officials. The freshman congressman’s failure to comply with basic transparency protocols has sparked criticism, particularly as lawmakers increasingly shape crypto policy. The delayed filings raise questions about oversight and ethical conduct amid the sector’s surging political relevance. Crypto advocates may see Gill’s holdings as a sign of growing interest within Congress, but his misstep shows the need for stricter accountability when digital assets enter the halls of power. SEC Chair Paul Atkins Calls Out Enforcement-First Approach Over in Washington, SEC Chair Paul Atkins delivered pointed remarks before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee this week, criticizing the agency’s previous stance of “regulation-by-enforcement” toward crypto. BREAKING SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says his top priority is a clear, rational crypto regulatory framework —….. especially around custody & $XRP Clarity is coming. pic.twitter.com/30eyZLdwEg — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 3, 2025 Atkins argued that the former approach stifled innovation and inadvertently opened the door for fraudulent behavior to flourish. “Enforcement without clear rules sends the wrong message,” Atkins said, emphasizing the need for proactive, rules-based regulation. He also praised the SEC’s revamped Crypto Task Force, describing it as a key player in developing a more nuanced and transparent regulatory framework for digital assets. This shift in rhetoric from the SEC’s highest office marks a potential turning point in crypto regulation. For years, the agency’s ambiguous stance has frustrated industry players. Atkins’ testimony could pave the way for more constructive engagement with blockchain projects—if it results in real policy changes and not just regulatory lip service. California Leads With Progressive Crypto Legislation While federal agencies wrestle with regulatory philosophy and enforcement, California is pushing ahead with bold legislative moves that could redefine state-level crypto governance. The State Assembly passed Assembly Bill 1180 with unanimous support on June 2. The bill authorizes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to create a pilot program allowing state fees to be paid using digital financial assets. Assembly member Avelino Valencia, the bill’s sponsor, called the move “a turning point for public sector adoption of financial technologies.” This marks one of the most concrete steps by any U.S. state toward integrating crypto into official government operations. Should the bill progress into law, California could serve as a testing ground for broader crypto utility in public finance, potentially setting a template for others to follow. Hot on the heels of AB 1180, another bill —Assembly Bill 1052—also cleared the State Assembly in a 78-0 vote. AB 1052 seeks to modernize unclaimed property laws, particularly how dormant digital assets are handled. JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 If passed by the Senate, the law would prevent dormant crypto held by custodians (like exchanges) from being automatically liquidated. Instead, these assets would be safeguarded in their native form by a licensed custodian. This legislation specifically excludes self-custodied wallets from its reach, a key detail for privacy advocates and decentralization purists. Together, these two bills reflect a state legislature that understands the nuances of crypto and is willing to embrace its potential while mitigating risk. SEC Secures $1.1M Judgment in Crypto Fraud Case Elsewhere, the SEC notched a courtroom win against bad actors in the crypto space. A federal judge in Georgia issued a default judgment on June 3 against Keith Crews, who was accused of orchestrating a fraudulent crypto investment scheme. Crews failed to respond to the SEC’s lawsuit, resulting in a $1.1 million penalty that includes disgorged profits and civil fines. This case reinforces the agency’s ongoing commitment to enforcement, especially against blatant scams and fraudulent offerings. While Atkins may be steering the SEC away from broad, punitive enforcement as a policy default, this judgment shows that the agency won’t hesitate to act decisively against clear misconduct. State vs. Federal—A Diverging Path? This week’s developments present a revealing contrast. On one hand, California is emerging as a trailblazer in creating thoughtful crypto legislation, focusing on utility and protection. On the other, federal lawmakers continue to grapple with oversight lapses and internal tensions on how best to regulate the space. Congressman Gill’s disclosure mishap illustrates the regulatory gaps in the nation’s capital, while SEC Chair Atkins’ comments suggest a changing of the guard in federal crypto policy. Meanwhile, the SEC’s ongoing enforcement actions indicate that investor protection remains a top priority, even as the agency explores more collaborative approaches.

2025-06-06T20:40:27,"Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment In a significant move signaling growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Davis Commodities (NASDAQ: DTCK) has announced a strategic allocation of funds towards Bitcoin. Following a successful $30 million fundraising round, the company has earmarked 15% of these proceeds, totaling $4.5 million, specifically for acquiring Bitcoin (BTC). This decision, detailed in a recent Globe Newswire press release, positions Davis Commodities among a growing list of publicly traded companies adding the premier cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. But why are companies like Davis Commodities making this move now, and what does it signify for the broader market? Why Davis Commodities is Investing in Bitcoin The press release highlights several key reasons behind Davis Commodities’ decision to build Bitcoin reserves: Enhancing Asset Allocation: Diversifying treasury assets beyond traditional holdings like cash and short-term bonds. Improving Flexibility: Gaining exposure to a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Hedging Against Inflation: Utilizing Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties in an environment of economic uncertainty and potential currency devaluation. This strategy aligns with the rationale provided by other corporations that have previously adopted Bitcoin. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The trend of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets gained significant momentum in recent years. Pioneered by firms like MicroStrategy, this movement has seen various companies across different sectors explore or implement similar strategies. While the scale of investment varies greatly, the underlying motivations often revolve around macroeconomic concerns and the potential long-term value appreciation of Bitcoin. Davis Commodities’ $4.5 million allocation, while modest compared to some larger corporate treasuries, represents a clear statement of intent and a belief in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a component of a modern treasury strategy. It adds another data point to the increasing institutional adoption narrative. Understanding BTC Reserves for Corporations For companies, establishing BTC reserves isn’t just about buying cryptocurrency; it involves navigating various considerations: Benefits: Potential for significant appreciation, boosting treasury value. Diversification away from traditional financial risks. Attracting investors interested in crypto-exposed stocks. Acting as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Challenges: High price volatility, potentially leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions. Custody and security risks associated with holding digital assets. Accounting and tax complexities. Companies must weigh these factors carefully before committing capital to Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Davis Commodities and Investors? For Davis Commodities, this move integrates them into the digital asset landscape. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and could potentially appeal to a new segment of investors interested in companies with exposure to the crypto market. The $4.5 million represents a portion of their newly raised capital, indicating a deliberate strategic choice rather than an impulsive decision. For investors in Davis Commodities, this introduces a new variable. The company’s performance may now be influenced, to some extent, by the price movements of Bitcoin. It also raises questions about the company’s long-term digital asset strategy – is this a one-time purchase, or the beginning of a larger allocation over time? Institutional Adoption Continues to Grow The investment by Davis Commodities is another piece of evidence supporting the narrative of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While retail interest often drives headlines, corporate and institutional investments provide a layer of stability and legitimacy to the asset class. Each new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to its maturity and acceptance within the traditional financial system. This trend is being watched closely by market participants, as significant corporate holdings can influence supply dynamics and market sentiment. The move by Davis Commodities, a company seemingly outside the core tech or finance sectors typically associated with early crypto adoption, is particularly noteworthy. Actionable Insights What can readers take away from this development? Monitor Corporate Filings: Keep an eye on press releases and financial reports from publicly traded companies for similar announcements. Assess Company Strategy: Understand why a company is investing in Bitcoin – is it a treasury hedge, an investment, or part of a new business line? Consider Portfolio Diversification: While not financial advice, the trend of corporate diversification into Bitcoin prompts individuals to consider their own asset allocation strategies. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset holdings is constantly evolving. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for Davis Commodities Davis Commodities’ decision to allocate $4.5 million of its recently raised capital to Bitcoin reserves marks a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Driven by goals of enhanced asset allocation, improved flexibility, and inflation hedging, this move places the company squarely within the burgeoning trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification and long-term value preservation appear to be compelling enough for companies like Davis Commodities to take the plunge. This development further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class attracting attention beyond traditional crypto circles.

The stock-to-flow model is a predictive tool that assumes the scarcity of a commodity drives the price. “Bitcoin price [is] at $104,000, which is still far away from the stock-to-flow value of $500,000 based on fundamentals, scarcity fundamentals. That’s what I expect the average over this four-year cycle to be. So we’re still far away from that. But we’re also still only one year in the cycle, we have three years to go and so I think Bitcoin is very undervalued.” According to Plan B, Bitcoin is at the “very beginning of a bull market” based on historical precedent. “We made a fake loop in bull market territory after the January 2024 [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds] ETF introductions. And we’re now right back at where all the bull markets in the past have started. So it’s a very bullish signal if you ask me.” The quant analyst says Bitcoin could skyrocket by up to approximately 860% over the course of the current cycle. “[Bitcoin] is currently in a bull market, targeting… let’s say $250,000 to $1 million range for the average price in this cycle.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,300 at time of writing.

2025-06-06T20:00:38,"Here’s XRP Likely Price If Its Market Dominance Surges to 40%","XRP’s price trajectory could see significant upward movement if its market dominance rises to 40%, surpassing its historical peak of 31.33%. Currently far from this level, a rise of such magnitude would require XRP to capture a sizable share from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Historical Context of XRP Dominance XRP’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market has fluctuated notably since it first gained significant traction. After the launch of the XRP Ledger, XRP began rising in market prominence, and by October 2014, it had surpassed Litecoin to become the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. Over the following months, its market share climbed steadily, reaching 20.69% in January 2015. However, this dominance began to wane by early 2016 as Ethereum emerged as a strong competitor. XRP’s share of the market eventually dropped to 0.95% by March 2017. This was partly due to XRP underperforming during the early stages of the 2017 bull market. XRP rebounded later that year, and its market dominance peaked at 31.33% when its price hit $3.80. Since then, XRP’s dominance has experienced a prolonged decline, bottoming out at around 1.21% in November 2024. Recent Performance and Current Status Following a slight recovery in price, particularly after the U.S. elections in late 2024, XRP saw a renewed increase in market share. By January 2025, its dominance reached a four-year high of 5.58%. As of now, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.97%, with a market capitalization of $128.51 billion. Despite this relatively low dominance figure, some analysts remain optimistic. They propose a scenario where XRP could reach an unprecedented 40% dominance, well above its previous high. To achieve this, XRP would need to overtake significant portions of the current market share held by Bitcoin (64.15%) and Ethereum (9.71%). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projected Price at 40% Market Dominance If XRP were to achieve 40% dominance in the current $3.24 trillion crypto market, its total market cap would rise to roughly $1.296 trillion. With a circulating supply of around 58.75 billion tokens, this would imply a price point of approximately $22.06 per XRP. Market observers, including figures such as Oscar Ramos, have floated similar projections, suggesting that a $22 price is attainable if XRP reaches a $1 trillion valuation. However, they also acknowledge that achieving 40% market dominance in the current market structure would be a considerable challenge. Notably, XRP might not need to reach 40% dominance to attain a $22 valuation. If its current 3.97% share of the market remains constant while the broader crypto market expands significantly, say to $32.65 trillion, XRP could still reach the $1.296 trillion mark needed for the $22 price target. A July 2023 report from Forbes projected that crypto-focused ETFs could introduce as much as $30 trillion in new capital into the space, providing a potential pathway for such market expansion.

2025-06-06T20:00:07,"Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally","Ethereum has experienced a sharp pullback, retracing over 10% since yesterday as the broader crypto market faced a wave of volatility. Despite the decline, bulls are showing resilience. ETH failed to break below the critical $2,300 mark and is now holding firm above $2,400, a sign that demand remains strong at current levels. Investors are watching closely as Ethereum consolidates and attempts to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 Top analyst M-Log1 shared a technical update indicating that ETH is currently sitting around the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart. This level often acts as a major trend indicator, and reclaiming it could spark renewed bullish momentum. According to M-Log1, Ethereum’s price action suggests a potential recovery toward the $2,600 zone, especially if bulls manage to push above the 50 and 100 MAs. This renewed interest in ETH comes at a pivotal moment for altcoins. Many market participants are now evaluating whether this consolidation phase marks the beginning of a larger move for Ethereum and related assets. For now, all eyes remain on key technical levels as the market awaits confirmation of direction. Ethereum Eyes Recovery After Market Shake-Up Ethereum is showing signs of strength amid heightened market volatility sparked by rising tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. The sharp war of words between the two high-profile figures triggered a wave of uncertainty in financial markets, prompting swift reactions across the cryptocurrency sector. While Bitcoin remains stable above the $100K level, altcoins have experienced significant pullbacks—ETH included. However, the coming weeks are shaping up to be decisive, with many investors closely watching for signs of recovery. ETH has retraced over 10% in recent sessions but is now bouncing from the lows. Bulls appear confident as Ethereum holds above the $2,400 level and attempts to reclaim key moving averages on the 4-hour chart. According to M-Log1, ETH currently sits near the 200MA, a crucial technical level that often signals trend reversals. He notes that Ethereum is bouncing exactly as expected following last week’s broader altcoin correction. M-Log1’s analysis points to the $2,600 level as the next target. A successful push toward that zone, along with reclaiming the 50 and 100 moving averages, could set the stage for a strong rally throughout June. If ETH manages to build momentum and maintain support, the altcoin market could experience renewed bullish energy. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and political risk, Ethereum’s resilience is notable. With technical support holding and confidence slowly returning, the setup remains constructive, assuming bulls continue to defend key levels. As the market digests recent events, ETH’s price action over the next few days will offer critical insight into whether a new altseason can take off or whether further downside is still in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? ETH Weekly Chart: Key Levels Hold Ethereum is currently trading around $2,475 on the weekly chart, showing signs of hesitation as it faces strong resistance near the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $2,450. Although ETH managed to surge above this level briefly, the candle is showing rejection near the $2,680 area, which coincides with both historical resistance and the upper end of the 34-week EMA ($2,499). This confluence of resistance levels is proving to be a critical zone for bulls to reclaim. Despite the recent bounce from April lows, ETH is still struggling to gain bullish momentum on the higher timeframes. The last few candles reflect indecision, with long wicks and narrowing body size, suggesting that while buyers are defending downside levels, sellers remain active near resistance. If ETH fails to close the week above the 200-week SMA, a pullback toward the $2,300–$2,250 range is likely, which aligns with the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout On the upside, a strong weekly close above $2,700 would be a major breakout signal, potentially triggering a broader altseason.

In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers on the social media platform X that it’s “crunch time” for the top crypto asset by market cap after recovering from a dip, noting that it could plunge below $100,000 if BTC bulls don’t step up. “Recap: BTC failed at $110,000 and $106,600 in May [and hit] $100,000 on Thursday. We had the Asia session bounce back to $104,000 as anticipated. Now, does Bitcoin fill the $97,000/$98,000 imbalance? Or can bulls reclaim this $104,000-$105,000 area? Crunch time.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also said that the flagship digital asset bouncing off $100,000 to hit $104,000 was a bullish scenario that would likely send BTC above $106,000. “There you go. Nice bounce from $100,000 support. Looking pretty bullish so far. $104,000-$105,000 is resistance today. A reclaim would be bullish back to $106,600, but it’s resistance until proven otherwise.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett goes on to note that other factors could influence the price of BTC, such as how the US stock market is doing and the dominance levels of Tether ( USDT ), the largest stablecoin in the world by volume. “Almost there, fam. Same target and path I shared for crypto on May 21st. I’m not saying Tether dominance at 5% will be the bottom for BTC, but there should be a strong reaction in that area if tested. Remember that USDT [dominance] moves inversely to Bitcoin.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,202 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

The list includes EU states, the UK, and most G20 countries but excludes the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Exchanges will only occur if partner countries meet reciprocity and compliance benchmarks. Switzerland’s Federal Council has approved a proposal to begin automatically exchanging data on crypto-asset holdings with 74 partner states starting in 2027, according to a statement issued on June 6. The exchange will be based on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The framework mandates information sharing between jurisdictions to detect offshore digital asset holdings and ensure tax compliance. Reciprocity and Compliance Conditions For Data Exchange The approved list includes all EU countries, the United Kingdom , and most G20 members, but excludes the United States and Saudi Arabia. Exchange of data will only proceed if partner jurisdictions agree to reciprocity and meet technical and legal standards set out under CARF. The Swiss parliament is currently reviewing the legal foundation for this data-sharing regime, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. The first data transmission will take place in 2027. The Federal Council stated that the same review mechanisms used for financial account data exchanges will be applied to crypto-asset reporting. Partner states must undergo periodic assessments to verify continued compliance. The update positions Switzerland among the first countries preparing to implement the OECD’s global reporting framework. Authorities said the scope of the exchange may expand, depending on the evolving interest of other countries and future updates to international standards. Drawing on lessons from the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss government is calling for measures like stricter capital requirements for big banks with branches abroad + additional powers for financial market supervisor @FINMA_media . https://t.co/zuWKbuyY5t @efd_dff @sif_sfi pic.twitter.com/n0z3Hvk5hE — Swiss Federal Government (@SwissGov) June 6, 2025 Global Compliance and Local Crypto Use in Switzerland Spar Switzerland recently announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments at all store locations following pilot programs in Zug and Kreuzlingen. The system uses QR codes from DFX Swiss’s OpenCryptoPay platform, allowing Lightning Network payments to settle instantly at checkout. Spar is the first major grocer in the country to adopt Bitcoin at full scale. While regulators are aligning with international reporting standards, merchants and consumers are advancing on separate terms, using Bitcoin for everyday payments without waiting for central bank endorsement. Switzerland now faces a dual trajectory: international compliance through frameworks like the OECD’s CARF, and internal normalization of crypto through market use. This parallel movement could test how governments balance transparency obligations abroad with decentralized payment activity at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is CARF, and how does it differ from previous financial reporting standards? Unlike traditional financial account standards, it includes digital tokens and requires identifying wallet holders and transaction data, even when no intermediaries are involved. Why are the U.S. and Saudi Arabia not included in the approved list? The statement does not detail specific exclusions. However, both countries have taken distinct positions on global tax data-sharing and may not currently meet CARF participation or reciprocity requirements. Are more countries expected to join Switzerland’s data-sharing agreements? Authorities indicated that the scope of exchange could expand based on evolving interest and future changes to OECD standards. Regular assessments will determine which partner states remain eligible.

2025-06-06T19:50:17,"US Nonfarm Payrolls Astonishingly Beat Expectations: What it Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Nonfarm Payrolls Astonishingly Beat Expectations: What it Means for the Crypto Market Crypto investors, pay attention! While your focus might typically be on Bitcoin charts and altcoin movements, key economic indicators from the traditional financial world often have a significant ripple effect. The latest report on US nonfarm payrolls is one such piece of data that just landed, and it delivered a notable surprise, potentially influencing the broader financial landscape, including the digital asset space. US Nonfarm Payrolls: The Latest Astonishing Numbers According to data compiled by Investing.com, based on information from the U.S. Department of Labor, the United States saw a stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment during May. The economy added 139,000 jobs, surpassing the market consensus forecast of 126,000. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Actual Nonfarm Payrolls (May): 139,000 Market Expectation: 126,000 Result: Beat Expectations Actual Unemployment Rate (May): 4.2% Forecasted Unemployment Rate: 4.2% While the US unemployment rate held steady exactly as predicted at 4.2%, the beat on the headline job creation number is what captured the market’s immediate attention. This indicates a potentially more robust labor market than economists had anticipated. Understanding Why This Macroeconomic Data Matters So, why should you care about job numbers if you’re primarily interested in cryptocurrency? Because this type of macroeconomic data is a critical input for central bankers, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). The nonfarm payrolls report and the unemployment rate are key gauges of the ‘maximum employment’ side of that mandate. A strong labor market, as potentially suggested by these numbers, can influence the Fed’s stance on monetary policy. Think of it this way: If the economy is adding jobs rapidly and unemployment is low, it suggests the economy is healthy and growing. In such a scenario, the Fed might feel less pressure to maintain highly stimulative (loose) monetary policy, like low interest rates or quantitative easing. Conversely, a weakening job market might prompt the Fed to cut rates or inject liquidity to support growth. Analyzing the Nonfarm Payrolls Impact on Broader Markets Historically, strong job reports like this one can have varied effects on traditional markets: Stock Market: Often seen positively as it signals a healthy economy and potential for corporate earnings growth. However, if it fuels expectations of aggressive rate hikes, it can be negative for growth stocks. Bond Market: Typically leads to higher bond yields (lower prices) as investors anticipate tighter monetary policy and potentially higher inflation down the road. U.S. Dollar: A strong report often strengthens the U.S. dollar as higher interest rate expectations make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors. The nonfarm payrolls impact is a complex dance between current economic health and future monetary policy expectations. What Could Be the Crypto Market Reaction? Now, let’s connect the dots to digital assets. The crypto market reaction to macroeconomic data is often influenced by the prevailing sentiment regarding risk appetite and liquidity. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are often considered risk assets, similar to growth stocks or emerging market equities. They tend to perform well in environments of high liquidity and low interest rates, as investors are more willing to take on risk for higher potential returns. A stronger-than-expected jobs report, while good for the underlying economy, can sometimes be interpreted negatively by risk asset markets if it increases the likelihood of the Federal Reserve maintaining or accelerating a path towards tighter monetary policy (e.g., raising interest rates, reducing bond holdings). Potential scenarios for the crypto market reaction: Initial Negative Reaction: Markets might see the strong data as confirming the Fed’s path towards tighter policy, leading to a sell-off in risk assets, including crypto. Delayed or Muted Reaction: The market might already be pricing in some level of economic strength and potential tightening, leading to a less dramatic response. Focus Shifts: Traders might quickly move on to the next piece of data or crypto-specific news, diminishing the nonfarm payrolls impact. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, not just macroeconomic data. However, ignoring these broader economic signals would be a mistake. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for macroeconomic data like the jobs report to influence market sentiment, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major economic calendar releases, especially those from the U.S. Understand the Nuances: Don’t just react to the headline number. Try to understand what it means for the Federal Reserve’s potential actions. Manage Risk: Macroeconomic uncertainty can increase volatility. Ensure your portfolio is aligned with your risk tolerance. Look Beyond the Short Term: While macro data can cause short-term price swings, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. The beat in US nonfarm payrolls for May serves as a fresh reminder that the health of the traditional economy and the actions of central banks are intertwined with the performance of digital assets. The nonfarm payrolls impact is real, even in the decentralized world. Summary: Connecting Jobs Data to Your Crypto Portfolio The May US nonfarm payrolls report showed a stronger labor market than anticipated, adding 139,000 jobs compared to forecasts of 126,000, while the US unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%. This positive economic signal, derived from key macroeconomic data , has implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. Because monetary policy affects liquidity and risk appetite, the nonfarm payrolls impact extends to markets like cryptocurrency. While the immediate crypto market reaction can be complex and depend on broader sentiment, understanding this connection is vital for navigating the digital asset space effectively. It underscores the importance of viewing the crypto market not in isolation, but as part of a larger global financial ecosystem influenced by traditional economic forces.

2025-06-06T19:40:45,"Czech Minister of Finance will not resign over the recent Bitcoin scandal","Czech Republic’s Minister of Finance, Zbyněk Stanjura, has refused to resign in response to calls from the opposition to share responsibility over a controversial Bitcoin donation that already cost his colleague Pavel Blažek the post of Minister of Justice. A parliamentary session devoted to the politically damaging incident was adjourned without completing the debate. Opponents of the government have threatened a no-confidence vote and urged for Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s resignation, too. Finance Ministry has nothing to do with Blažek’s Bitcoin, says Stanjura The Czech Republic was rattled by an unprecedented scandal, charged enough to bring down the cabinet of the center-right SPOLU (“Together”) coalition, or at the very least negatively affect its chances in the upcoming elections in October. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek was forced to quit his seat over his key role in the case. It was revealed that his department had accepted 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in cryptocurrency as a donation from a former darknet market operator and convicted drug dealer, Tomáš Jiřikovský. Another member of the government in Prague, Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, has now rejected calls for his resignation. Quoted by the Czech news agency CTK, he emphasized he had not violated the law and insisted that the Ministry of Justice was responsible for handling the gifted Bitcoin. On Thursday, Stanjura took to X to explain his take on Blažek’s embarrassing move, stressing that his own department was not involved in the decision to accept the crypto. Kauzu bitcoin vnímám jako selhání ministra Blažka a jeho úřadu. A znovu opakuji, že @MinFinCZ s celým procesem ani rozhodnutím @SpravedlnostCZ přijmout miliardu od drogového dealera nemělo nic společného – a ani nemá žádnou pravomoc takové kroky jiného resortu schvalovat nebo… — Zbyněk Stanjura (@Zbynek_Stanjura) June 5, 2025 However, commenting for Czech media, the finance minister admitted he knew about Blažek’s intentions to take the coins, claiming he tried to convince him not to do it. Speaking to the Seznam Zprávy news website, Stanjura stated he “saw the potential political problem” but could not prevent it. In an address to lawmakers earlier this week, Czech President Petr Pavel also described the scandal as a “major problem” which tarnishes the country’s reputation abroad. According to a report by the public radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas ( ČRo ), the Ministry of Justice has already sold part of the donated crypto assets in auctions held between March and May this year, the first such sale conducted by a public body in the country. Czech parliament holds extraordinary session over controversial crypto donation On Thursday, the Bitcoin scandal hit the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czechia’s parliament, but the prolonged debate, abundant with political statements and clashes, produced little results. Attempts to continue the extraordinary session on Friday failed and it’s unclear when it will resume. Political forces challenging the government, including the largest opposition party, the right-wing populist ANO (“Yes”), called for the resignation of the whole Fiala cabinet. Led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, ANO has already gathered enough signatures to initiate a vote of no confidence . Both the current head of government and his outgoing justice minister acknowledged that taking the Bitcoin was a “mistake.” Petr Fiala said accepting the donation without verification was “at least ethically problematic,” while Pavel Blazek apologized but rejected accusations of corruption. This wasn’t enough for the opposition and the Mayors and Independents (STAN) faction demanded that the incoming Minister of Justice Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS), describe in detail how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the state and identify all responsible persons. Meanwhile, the Czech Cryptocurrency Association took the opportunity to slam the government for the misstep. It said in a statement that by accepting the coins, “the state failed to comply with the basic requirements that any entity subject to the European MiCA regulation or the Anti-Money Laundering Act must follow.” Czech authorities neglected all precautionary measures that should apply to donations of any size, such as identifying the donor and their motives, establishing the origin of the funds as well as assessing the potential risk of links to crime, the industry organization stressed.

The analyst earlier alluded to the Fibonacci levels in previous cycles as the reason why the altcoin can record such a parabolic surge in this market cycle. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $27 In This Cycle In an X post , ChartNerd declared that an XRP price rally to between $8 and $27 is still loading. He made this statement while alluding to a previous analysis , in which he noted that the altcoin met both of its 1.272 and 1.1618 Fibonacci levels . The analyst then remarked that this cycle’s Fib 1.272 and 1.618 levels are $8.40 and $27. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has also predicted that the XRP price can rally to as high as $27 in this market cycle. The analyst had previously highlighted several reasons why the altcoin can reach this target, including alluding to the 2017 market cycle when XRP recorded a legendary gain of around 63,000%. The analyst is confident that the altcoin can replicate this run.

Meanwhile, the analyst also recently highlighted a bullish candle formation, which showed that XRP can at least reach $22. Crypto analyst Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price is about to witness an upcoming surge to $23. He noted that the altcoin is forming another Wave Structure in the weekly timeframe, creating the potential rally to this target. The analyst added that this new wave structure aligns with the previous targets and historical pattern in November 2024. What To Expect In The Short Term In an X post , Dark Defender provided insights into what to expect from the XRP price action in the short term. The analyst stated that, on the weekly chart, XRP is moving towards the primary resistance level at around $2.40. The support level to watch on this move is $2.2222, while $5.85 is the target as the altcoin eyes a rally to the upside. Commenting on the short-term move for the XRP price, Egrag Crypto stated that XRP has to close above $2.30, $2.35, $2.36, $2.45, and $2.65 to have a bullish breakout. The analyst claimed that $2.65 is the ‘Go-Go’ signal as the altcoin eyes a rally to a new all-time high (ATH). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.12, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-could-reach-27/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Altcoin|ChartNerd|Coinmarketcap|Dark Defender|Egrag Crypto|Fibonacci Levels|Wave Structure|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

Strategy Upsizes Stock Offering To $1 Billion According to a June 6 press release , the Bitcoin treasury company will sell 11.76 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), expecting to bring in an estimated $979.7 million after fees and expenses. STRD, which comes after Strategy’s other preferred offerings STRF and STRK, will be offered to the public at $85 per share, with the sale set to close on June 10. Strategy said the product will pay professional and institutional investors a 10% non-cumulative dividend. The company plans to use the almost $1 billion in net proceeds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” “It’s our high-yield credit instrument,” Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a video that he posted on X earlier this week while referencing STRD. “Compared to STRK or STRF, it should be a higher-yielding preferred instrument.” During a presentation, Saylor shared a graphic indicating that STRD, which is listed on the Nasdaq, has “limited” sensitivity to the price of Bitcoin. In terms of senior status, STRD investors rank behind STRF and STRK’s holders, but they come before common shareholders. “STRD represents the fourth gear in our Bitcoin engine,” he continued. “The point of our engine is to generate BTC torque via surgical management of our [at-the-money offering programs].” Strategy now holds an eye-popping 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, bought at an average price of $70,023 per coin. That’s the equivalent of almost 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. At the apex crypto’s current price of $105,063, the $1 billion would allow the Bitcoin development company to purchase an additional 9,518 BTC, considerably more than its latest purchase of 705 Bitcoin for $75.1 million announced on June 2.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-takes-a-shot-at-the-moon-with-latest-1-billion-bitcoin-buying-tactic/,"BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T19:30:00,"Peter Schiff’s Call for Traditional Economics Clashes with US Bitcoin Reserve Policy","Peter Schiff criticized the May jobs report, warning about poor quality job growth. He advocates for rate hikes and spending cuts to boost the manufacturing sector. His advice contrasts with a new US policy to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, a figure that beat market expectations but drew sharp criticism from economist Peter Schiff, who warned the growth is occurring in the wrong sectors. As Schiff advocates for a return to traditional economic principles, his views now stand in stark contrast to a new government strategy that embraces Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. Schiff pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that job gains were concentrated in non-productive sectors, with healthcare adding 62,000 jobs and hospitality adding 48,000. Meanwhile, the domestic manufacturing sector shed 8,000 jobs, its largest decline this year.

A pennant formation on the daily chart may signal the next leg higher, if volume confirms the breakout. After a sustained uptrend marked by higher highs and higher lows, Hyperliquid ( Hype ) has entered a period of consolidation. This pause in momentum is forming a textbook bullish pennant, a pattern often associated with trend continuation. Technical confluence and reclaimed levels now position Hyperliquid for a potential breakout in the sessions ahead. Key technical points Pennant Formation on Daily Timeframe: Consolidation with converging trendlines suggests a coiling market preparing for a breakout. Reclaim of Volume Profile Levels: Price has reclaimed the value area low, point of control, and now trades above the value area high. Bullish Market Structure: A consistent sequence of higher highs and higher lows confirms the prevailing trend remains intact. HypeUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView As price consolidates within the pennant structure, Hyperliquid is trading tightly between dynamic support and resistance lines, forming an apex. This coiling action is a common sign of price compression and typically precedes a breakout. The context in which this pennant is forming, within a dominant bullish trend, adds strength to its breakout potential. The reclaim of major volume profile levels provides further insight into recent accumulation zones. Price moving above the point of control and reclaiming the value area high signals strong buyer interest and market acceptance at higher levels. You might also like: Cookie crypto price crumbling? Support holding firm at key level Importantly, Hyperliquid has maintained its bullish trend throughout the consolidation. Each pullback has been shallow, and no major support has been broken. This confirms the move is corrective in nature, rather than a reversal. However, one key factor is still missing: volume. For any breakout to be considered valid and sustainable, it must be accompanied by a surge in volume. Without this confirmation, price may continue to drift within the pennant or produce a false breakout. What to expect in the coming price action If Hyperliquid sees a strong breakout above the pennant resistance with a noticeable increase in volume, the bullish trend is likely to resume with momentum. Traders should monitor volume closely near the apex to confirm breakout strength and validate continuation toward new highs.

2025-06-06T19:19:32,"Meme Coins to Megacaps: Trump–Musk Clash Ripples Through Global Markets","In just 24 hours, a public spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk sent shockwaves through crypto markets. The Official Trump (TRUMP) token lost $233 million in market value. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed suit. Their feud, which began this week when Musk criticized Trump’s flagship tax and spending bill, has morphed into a wider story about how political dramas can sway digital assets. Political Rift Sparks Crypto Volatility On June 5, 2025, Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to lambast one of Trump’s spending proposals. Trump responded later the same day, calling Musk “disappointing” and suggesting their “great relationship” was over. Source: CoinMarketCap Musk fired back on May 23, accusing Trump of “ingratitude” and claiming that without him, Trump “would have lost the election.” Source: X Within hours, traders shifted positions. The Official Trump token’s market capitalization fell from $2.168 billion to $1.935 billion—an 11 percent swing that erased $233 million in value, according to CoinMarketCap data. TRUMP’s price slid from $10.83 to $9.66, a daily drop of 10.74 percent and a weekly decline of 15.58 percent. Trading volume surged to $876.85 million, up 211.87 percent in 24 hours. Meme Coins Under Pressure Musk’s beloved Dogecoin also felt the fallout. DOGE slipped 7.1 percent over the same 24-hour span. Volume on DOGE jumped to nearly $2 billion, a 149.75 percent increase, per CoinMarketCap data. The surge in trading activity suggests a knee-jerk reaction to Musk’s polemics. Both tokens illustrate how “narrative-driven” assets can be. TRUMP and DOGE, once buoyed by social media hype and celebrity endorsements, remain vulnerable to abrupt shifts in sentiment. These two tokens rank among the worst performers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Mega Caps: More Than Just Meme Coins The Trump–Musk feud did not confine its effects to TRUMP and DOGE. Several large-cap tokens saw muted but noticeable moves on May 23. Cardano (ADA) dipped 2.3 percent. Solana (SOL) fell 1.8 percent. Ethereum (ETH) lost 1.2 percent. Trading volumes for these altcoins rose between 15 and 40 percent, signaling traders hedging or rebalancing against the sudden narrative shift. Meanwhile, megacap assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum—which together account for over 60 percent of total crypto market capitalization—saw slight volatility but maintained upward trajectories. For now, traders watch the headlines closely. Each tweet from Trump or Musk carries an immediate market impact. The Official Trump token traded at $9.66—down 10.74 percent for the day—while Dogecoin hovered at $0.317, off 7.1 percent. These moves underscore how real-world politics can shape on-chain valuations in minutes.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/meme-coins-to-megacaps-trump-musk-clash-ripples-through-global-markets/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|Meme Coins",cryptocompare

According to the company, this marks the largest-ever issuance of stock warrants in Japan and the first time moving strike warrants have been sold at or above current share prices in the nation. “Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our bitcoin strategy,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in a Friday post on X. Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy. Our new target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. Details here: https://t.co/ahL27o9QBg pic.twitter.com/njYybVq1uu — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 6, 2025 Metaplanet is allocating roughly 96% of the capital raised to buying bitcoin, with tiny amounts set for bond redemptions and income-generating strategies such as selling put options. The new shares will be sold to Cayman-based fund EVO FUND, which has backed Metaplanet’s previous financing deals. The 555 Million Plan is a follow-up to its earlier “ 21 Million Plan ” which raised $600 million earlier this year and helped the Japanese-based company to buy about 9,000 BTC. “Bitcoin is repricing the global cost of capital,” Metapanet postulated in a statement. “Through our 555 Million Plan, Metaplanet is doubling down on a high-conviction, equity-driven capital markets strategy to accelerate our bitcoin accumulation trajectory. As the most volatile listed equity in Japan, we are not scared of turbulence — we harness it.” Metaplanet’s Ambitious Goal To Amass 210,000 BTC By 2027 The new round aims to raise enough funds to bolster its holdings to over 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 from the previous 10,000 BTC goal and 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 from 21,000 BTC. Looking even further, Metaplanet is eyeing 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027 to join the Bitcoin 1% club — referencing holdings of 1% or more of its total 21 million supply. Metaplanet currently holds 8,888 BTC following its latest acquisition of 1,088 BTC for $117 million on June 2. It is now 10th 10th-ranked among corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The new 100,000 BTC target means it is committing to buy at least 91,112 BTC over the next 18 months.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/210000-btc-by-2027-metaplanet-unveils-5-4-billion-capital-raise-to-boost-bitcoin-treasury/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T19:10:10,"Why This Pundit Believes Elon Musk Might Be Two Weeks Away From Buying $100 Billion In Bitcoin","Elon Musk’s public clash with President Donald Trump over various economic and policy issues has drawn attention, sparking speculation over the role of crypto as a safe haven. Now, Compound founder Robert Leshner is suggesting that the richest man in the world is just two weeks away from acquiring a staggering $100 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and “tanking” the US dollar. This comes after the billionaire tech entrepreneur raised alarm against President Trump’s big, beautiful tax bill and its impact on national debt. Notably, the bill is projected to increase the fiscal deficit by 2.4 trillion over ten years. The feud escalated quickly, with Musk threatening to ground SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and Trump countering by claiming the government would move to cut off all federal support for Musk’s companies. Musk lashed back by linking Trump to the infamous Jeffrey Epstein’s files. The spectacular public blowup overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, triggering a pullback in prices. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin reached $105,888 before slumping to $100,783 within a matter of hours, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is holding at $103,956. Notably, Bitcoin OG Adam Back recently agreed with a post suggesting that Musk should buy 1 million in BTC to “front-run the US government and the Trump family”. Back is not hopeful that the Tesla/SpaceX boss will eventually go hard on Bitcoin, which would be “the obvious smart money move.” Though the eccentric billionaire does own Bitcoin, Back maintains that the current allocation is considerably low for his enormous net worth. That being said, someone as influential and famous as Musk taking fiscal concerns public could drive investors away from U.S. assets and into alternatives, such a Bitcoin. Moreover, it comes at a time when corporate treasury adoption of BTC and other crypto assets, including Solana and XRP , has picked up pace.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-this-pundit-believes-elon-musk-might-be-two-weeks-away-from-buying-100-billion-in-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
