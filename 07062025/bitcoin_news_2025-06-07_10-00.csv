2025-06-07T07:40:14,"AI Human Balance: Essential Human Oversight Crucial, Says Lattice CEO","BitcoinWorld AI Human Balance: Essential Human Oversight Crucial, Says Lattice CEO In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, where AI is reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace, discussions about its impact on human roles are more critical than ever. For the tech-savvy audience navigating this change, particularly those interested in cryptocurrencies and the broader digital frontier, understanding how AI integrates with human effort is key. Sarah Franklin, the CEO of Lattice, a prominent employee performance software company, offers a compelling perspective on finding the right AI human balance, emphasizing that human oversight isn’t just beneficial – it’s essential. Finding the Crucial AI Human Balance Speaking at SXSW London and in an interview with Bitcoin World, Franklin highlighted the importance of the word ‘balance’ when it comes to companies adopting AI technologies. While the allure of AI for cost savings and efficiency is undeniable, Franklin stresses that simply replacing large numbers of human workers might not be the winning strategy in the long run. Lattice, her company valued at $3 billion, is itself integrating more AI and automation features, but with a clear philosophy: putting people first. The conversation around AI human balance often pits automation against employment. However, Franklin argues that the most successful companies will be those that view AI as a tool to augment human capabilities, rather than replace them entirely. This involves retaining human employees and equipping them with AI assistants or ‘agents’ that enhance their productivity and insights. Building a Human-Centric AI Approach Franklin poses a fundamental question for leaders considering AI adoption: ‘Are you building for the success of the AI first [or are] you building for the success of the people and your customers first?’ This question cuts to the heart of a human-centric AI strategy. She argues that while efficiency is valuable, it should never come at the expense of trust. Trust, according to Franklin, is the most important currency a company possesses, and it is built by prioritizing the needs and experiences of customers and employees. Trading out human interaction for pure automation might offer short-term cost benefits, but it risks eroding the trust that customers place in a company. A human-centric AI approach ensures that technology serves people, not the other way around, fostering stronger relationships and sustainable growth. Ensuring Responsible AI Human Oversight Beyond just balance, Franklin also laid out key principles for responsible AI implementation, focusing on the necessity of AI human oversight. These principles include: Transparency: Companies must be open with employees about what AI systems are doing and how they are being used. Accountability: AI should be applied narrowly to specific goals, making its function understandable. Ultimately, humans must remain accountable for the outcomes and impacts of the AI. Responsibility: Leaders and companies have a responsibility to ensure AI is developed and used in ways that benefit society and its people. Without this clear AI human oversight, Franklin warns, companies risk becoming subservient to the technology rather than having the technology serve human goals. AI and Jobs: Augmenting the Workforce The discussion around AI and jobs is often framed negatively, focusing on potential job losses. However, Franklin’s perspective, reflected in Lattice’s own practices, is about augmentation. She shared that Lattice has developed an AI HR agent designed to provide proactive insights and assist employees with tasks like preparing for one-on-one meetings. Lattice also offers a platform allowing clients to create custom AI agents tailored to their specific business needs. This approach demonstrates how AI and jobs can coexist and thrive, with AI handling routine tasks and providing data-driven support, freeing up human employees to focus on higher-level strategic thinking, complex problem-solving, and crucial human interaction. The Future of Work is Grounded in Human Connection Ultimately, Franklin believes that the victors in this era of rapid AI advancement will be those who understand and prioritize the human element. The future of work, she argues, is not about replacing people, but about leveraging technology to enhance human capabilities and preserve the irreplaceable value of human connection. Retaining human oversight and ensuring that AI serves people are, in her view, among the most important guardrails companies can put in place. This vision for the future of work is one where technology empowers, rather than displaces, the human workforce, recognizing that empathy, creativity, and complex judgment remain uniquely human strengths. In conclusion, Sarah Franklin’s insights from SXSW London and her conversation with Bitcoin World offer a vital reminder for businesses navigating the AI revolution. Achieving AI human balance through transparency, accountability, and a steadfast commitment to putting people and customers first is not just an ethical choice; it’s a strategic imperative for building trust and ensuring success in the future of work. The companies that master AI human oversight and adopt a truly human-centric AI approach, understanding that AI and jobs can be complementary, will be the ones that truly win.

2025-06-07T07:36:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces minor recovery toward $0.63. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031.

The PI Network has shown a slight improvement in its trading price after several days of bearish momentum. According to the price on June 7, it shows the token recovering to $0.6291, following a sharp dip below $0.61.While the bounce is not strong, it follows heavy selling that pushed prices below $0.65, which could set the stage for the formation of a short-term floor. Pi 1-day chart shows stability as indicators hint at a possible recovery The Pi 1-day chart shows, the price increased slightly and closed at $0.6287. Lately, less pressure from sellers suggests that it might stabilise above $0.60. The MACD remain bearish, its line at -0.0386 is trading below the signal line at -0.0268. The histogram is getting smaller, showing that bearish momentum is declining. RSI has risen to 40.02, which is now below the neutral level of 50 and on its way toward the signal line at 43.30.

A small range in price after a drop implies that investors are accumulating. The MACD has moved slightly in a bullish direction, as the MACD line is at 0.0009 above the signal line at -0.0089.

Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand.

The talks will include US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. While past discussions, such as those in Geneva, have led to a temporary easing of tariffs, deeper concerns persist. China remains frustrated by US policies limiting student visas and advising chipmakers to restrict business with Chinese firms. Beijing also accuses Washington of stalling efforts to export essential materials used in advanced technology. Crypto Market Rises Amid Economic Uncertainty Amid these tensions, the cryptocurrency market is showing notable strength. Bitcoin recently surged past $104,000, with Ethereum also holding strong gains. Data from analytics firm Santiment shows a growing number of crypto holders, now at 55 million for Bitcoin and 148 million for Ethereum, suggesting increased investor interest in digital assets during uncertain economic times. This optimism is being driven by a mix of global uncertainty and growing belief in crypto as a hedge against traditional market instability. Interest Rates and the Crypto Boom Moreover, Trump’s aggressive push for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is also affecting crypto. Historically, when interest rates go down, people often look for new places to invest their money, and crypto becomes one of those options. With inflation still hanging around and global tensions rising, more investors see digital assets as a safe backup plan.

Ark Invest Purchases $373 Million in Circle Shares The acquisitions were made through Ark's Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW) and Fintech Innovation (ARKF) funds. The purchase came the same day Circle began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “CRCL.” The company’s shares rose 168.5% on its first day of trading, closing at $83.23. The intraday high was $96. The shares were priced well above the company’s upwardly revised IPO price of $31 due to strong demand. Circle’s IPO Process and Its Impact on the Crypto Industry Circle has attempted to go public twice before, first in 2021 through a SPAC merger and then in 2024 through a confidential S-1 filing. The company filed its latest filing with the SEC in April of this year, citing concerns that the IPO could be hindered by market uncertainty stemming from President Trump’s tariffs. However, the IPO was a success. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire commented on the IPO: “Our becoming a public company is a powerful and important milestone in the transition to an internet-based financial system.” Circle's USDC is the world's second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin after Tether's USDT, with a supply of $60.6 billion.

Ark Invest’s investment philosophy calls for no individual asset to weigh more than 10% of the fund’s portfolio. This strategy aims to maintain diversification within the fund and allows for rebalancing if Circle shares increase in value. As of now, Circle stocks are included in Ark funds as follows: With a 4.4% weight in the ARKK fund ($251.8 million), 4.4% ($77.2 million) in ARKW fund, 4.3% ($44.5 million) in ARKF funds.

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Bitcoin's Rise: Could It Reach New Heights? Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that changed how we think about money. Created in 2009 by an unknown person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money directly between people without a bank or middleman. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a digital system where everyone shares the same record of transactions. This shared system ensures everyone agrees on who owns what, making it secure and trustworthy. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen big ups and downs. By 2025, it has reached new milestones, surpassing previous all-time highs. Many early investors have seen significant returns. Some experts believe Bitcoin will continue to rise. Predictions suggest it could reach prices as high as $1.5 million by 2030, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Others are less optimistic, like Warren Buffett, who doubts its long-term value. Whether Bitcoin will keep climbing depends on many factors, like demand and adoption by big institutions. While some are hopeful about its future, it's important to consider the risks. Bitcoin's journey is ongoing, and only time will tell if it will reach new heights. Solana: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Transforming Digital Transactions Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former engineer at Qualcomm and Dropbox. It's designed to solve the speed and scalability problems of older networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana claims to process over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the fastest blockchain in the world. The secret behind Solana’s speed is its unique technology. It uses a system called Proof of History, which orders transactions efficiently. Combined with Proof of Stake, parallel processing, and data compression, Solana achieves high performance without sacrificing security. This makes it ideal for decentralized apps and services that need quick transactions. Since its launch, Solana has attracted many developers and investors. Its native token, SOL, has seen significant growth. In 2021, SOL's price soared, reflecting confidence in its technology and potential. This rapid rise caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. In the current market, Solana looks promising. Its fast and scalable platform is appealing for many applications. While competition is fierce, Solana's innovative approach sets it apart. However, it's important to consider the challenges it faces, such as network outages and competition from other blockchains. Looking ahead, Solana's future will depend on continued adoption and technological advancements. While past performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. Investors should keep an eye on Solana's development and its ability to overcome challenges. Its potential to shape the future of blockchain technology makes it a project worth watching. Is XRP Set for a Breakthrough? Exploring Ripple's 2025 Prospects XRP, Ripple's cryptocurrency, aims to revolutionize global money transfers with speed and low costs. Its technology enables quick transactions between currencies, gaining support from banks. XRP's price has fluctuated. From under a cent in 2013 to $3.84 in 2018. Though it hasn't regained that peak by 2025, its technology and adoption suggest potential. Legal challenges with the SEC, resolved in 2024 with a penalty, caused uncertainty. But the settlement led to a price boost, showing renewed optimism for XRP. Experts have mixed long-term views. Some predict XRP reaching up to $45 by 2030; others expect modest growth. Market sentiment and partnerships will influence its future. With strong technology improving transactions, XRP is intriguing. Despite uncertainties, its potential rise makes it worth considering for future-minded investors in this market cycle. Cardano's Climb: ADA's Potential in the Current Market Cycle Cardano, launched in 2017, is a blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. Unlike Bitcoin's energy-heavy proof-of-work method, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scalability. This eco-friendly approach makes it a standout in the crypto world. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano aims to host decentralized apps. Its token, ADA, is used for transactions and staking, allowing users to earn rewards by helping secure the network. In 2021, ADA reached a high of $3.10. Experts predict that with Bitcoin's halving leading to a bull market, ADA could rise significantly. Forecasts for 2030 range from $4.15 to as high as $28, suggesting strong growth potential. Opinions differ on ADA's future price. Some are bullish, predicting $8 in 2025, while others are more cautious, estimating under $1. This highlights the uncertainty in crypto predictions. In today's market, ADA seems attractive due to its strong fundamentals and growing developer interest. As Cardano continues to improve its technology, it could become more valuable. While the future is uncertain, many see great potential in Cardano. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) have shown strong performance, their short-term potential appears limited. These well-known coins may not offer the rapid gains that some investors seek in the current bull market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a promising alternative. This new entrant aims to leverage artificial intelligence to navigate the volatile meme coin market. By providing AI-powered trading signals and automated trading, it seeks to help investors capitalize on opportunities ahead of the crowd.

2025-06-07T07:20:48,"Google Gemini Sets Bitcoin Price for June 30, 2025","In a notable move that underscores the growing intersection of AI and financial forecasting, Google Gemini has weighed in on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. The forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $101,469, having declined 3.17% over the past 24 hours and 4.1% in the past week. Despite short-term volatility, analysts view this pullback as a healthy correction within a broader bullish trend. Bitcoin Scarcity Drives Institutional Accumulation The ongoing scarcity of Bitcoin remains one of its most powerful market drivers. With a fixed supply of only 21 million coins, Bitcoin has increasingly been seen as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This scarcity has fueled growing institutional interest. Among the major players, MicroStrategy recently acquired an additional 4,000 BTC , bringing its total holdings to 580,250 Bitcoins, or roughly 2.7% of the entire capped supply. Such aggressive accumulation by public companies highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a corporate treasury asset. Google Gemini Forecasts $103,000 Bitcoin by Month-End “Based on macroeconomic indicators, institutional momentum, and supply dynamics, Bitcoin is expected to increase by approximately 1.5% by the end of June 2025, reaching a price of $103,000,” Google Gemini stated in its latest market outlook. This AI-powered projection is cautiously optimistic, taking into account both the recent market correction and the broader strength of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. The forecast suggests a stable upward trend rather than speculative volatility, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a long-term asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ETFs Open the Floodgates for Institutional Investment Supporting this forecast is the meteoric rise of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have lowered the barrier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the digital asset. These ETFs have become increasingly popular as traditional financial institutions recognize Bitcoin’s investment potential. Leading the charge is BlackRock, the $11.5 trillion asset management giant. Its Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), marking a new era of institutional buy-in. Market Outlook: Can Bitcoin Hit the Mark? The ease of access provided by ETFs, paired with Bitcoin’s deflationary design and increasing corporate adoption, continues to fuel upward pressure on the asset’s price. Analysts note that the influx of capital from both retail and institutional investors is contributing to market resilience, even during short-term downturns. While Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, its underlying fundamentals have grown stronger. With the convergence of limited supply, rising ETF adoption, and corporate accumulation, the market appears poised for continued growth.

In a new interview at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Chanos says companies that are likely to fade away due to artificial intelligence (AI) advancements top his short list, including US computer giant International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). “We think there’s a number of companies that kind of pop up that are going to be roadkill on the AI highway. And right now, similar to the early part and mid part of the Dot-com boom, all the stocks are getting inflated. But there are a lot of companies who have business models that, if you think it through, are going to see them dramatically deflate because of the capabilities of AI as AI gets better and better. We call them either body shops or AI products that will basically be competed away… I’m not going to give you a bunch of names, but one of our old names that is in that group that we’ve been short on and off since 2020 has been the IBM, which has been a good stock in the last year and a half. It’s basically doubled, and after going down for 10 years. But it’s trading back at all-time high valuations. It’s not growing. It’s a body shop… We think it’s a business that’s going to continue to melt away, not right away, but AI will continue to hurt IT consultants and IT body shops.” IBM is trading for $268 at time of writing, up about 60% in the last 12 months. Another company on Chanos’ short list is used car retailer Carvana (CVNA), which is up 7,961% in the last 30 months after trading at $4.23 in January 2023. “We think that [Carvana is] still a misunderstood story… What really caught our eye and made it timely is a couple of positioning aspects, which these days, on the short side, are really important. Number one, the short interest is back down to multi-year lows, from being one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market in 2023, it’s now back below and back toward its pre-Covid levels of short interest as percentage shares outstanding, below 10%. But perhaps even more ominous is that the insiders have begun to sell in an absolute torrent of stock… It’s pretty much the C-suite are getting out seemingly as fast as they can.” Carvana is trading at $341 at time of writing.

2025-06-07T07:00:37,"Bitcoin Recovers From $100K Dip While On-Chain Data Shows Rising Miner Activity","Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after a brief but sharp dip triggered by recent market turbulence linked to public tensions between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The price of BTC had dropped to nearly $100,000 during the height of the reaction, but has since rebounded. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,891, marking a steady recovery from the 24-hour low. While the broader crypto market continues to digest the fallout, new data suggests that another force, miner activity, is beginning to shape the near-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback or Setup? On-Chain Metrics Hint at What’s Coming Next Bitcoin Surge in Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action According to on-chain analytics published by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the volume of BTC transferred to exchanges. Between May 19 and May 28, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day, levels not seen in previous market cycles. These inflows are often viewed as a proxy for miners’ intent to sell, which could influence short-term supply dynamics and introduce added volatility to BTC’s spot market performance. The rise in realized inflows from miners to exchanges is interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Since miners are key liquidity providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem, large-scale transfers to exchanges are typically seen as preparations to offload BTC. Historically, spikes in miner outflows have preceded periods of downward price pressure, particularly when they occur alongside fragile market conditions. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that while miner selling isn’t inherently negative, it can impact short-term price stability. As a result, traders and investors often monitor these flows to better assess potential risks. When miner inflows surge, it reflects the sector’s sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. CryptoOnchain noted: Paying close attention to these inflows—especially during historical peaks like the current phase—can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions. Hash Ribbon Signal Suggests Longer-Term Opportunity Amid rising sell pressure, another indicator is flashing a potential opportunity. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons indicator, a metric derived from comparing 30-day and 60-day moving averages of network hashrate, has recently produced a new buy signal. This metric is used to evaluate miner stress and recovery phases, and is generally interpreted as a signal that miners have gone through a period of capitulation and are now stabilizing or recovering. This signal has historically aligned with favorable long-term entry points, except in unique events like China’s 2021 mining ban. While the short-term effects of mining stress may contribute to price weakness, analysts suggest that these periods often set the stage for longer-term rallies. When miner capitulation resolves, it can clear excess supply from the market and establish stronger support levels.

2025-06-07T07:00:06,"Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Forms Bear Cross—Brace For Impact?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has formed a cross that may be considered a bearish signal. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Declined Under 200-Day SMA Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio has crossed below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) recently. The “ MVRV Ratio ” refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between the BTC Market Cap and Realized Cap. The Realized Cap here is a capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that calculates the total value of the asset’s supply by assuming the ‘real’ value of each individual token to be equal to the spot price at which it was last moved on the blockchain. This model is different from the usual Market Cap , which simply takes the value of all tokens equal to the current spot price. Since the last transfer of any coin is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is just a sum of the acquisition price of all tokens in circulation. One way to interpret the model is as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into Bitcoin. On the other hand, the Market Cap can be looked at as the value the holders are carrying in the present. Since the MVRV Ratio compares the two models, it basically tells us about the profit-loss situation of the investors as a whole. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this indicator, as well as its 200-day SMA, over the past year. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio has been notably above the 0% mark recently, which suggests the investors as a whole have been sitting on significant profit. The metric naturally went up as the asset’s rally earlier took the price to a new all-time high (ATH) and it managed to surpass as 200-day MA. Recently, however, the bearish turn in the coin has meant that the indicator has fallen back under the line. The last time that the MVRV Ratio dropped below its 200-day SMA was in February. From the chart, it’s apparent that this crossover proved to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. It now remains to be seen whether this same type of crossover will end up proving another bad omen for Bitcoin or not.

2025-06-07T06:40:40,"CFTC: Crucial Feedback Highlights Future of 24/7 Crypto Trading","BitcoinWorld CFTC: Crucial Feedback Highlights Future of 24/7 Crypto Trading The world of cryptocurrency never sleeps, and neither do its markets. This inherent 24/7 nature presents unique challenges and opportunities, especially when it comes to regulatory oversight. Recently, Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham shed light on a fascinating development: all public feedback received regarding the potential for 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a crucial signal about the future direction of digital asset regulation and financial market oversight. Why is 24/7 Crypto Trading Different? Unlike traditional financial markets, which operate on fixed schedules (think stock exchanges closing for the day), the cryptocurrency market is truly global and non-stop. This fundamental difference is at the heart of the conversation around 24/7 trading for derivatives. When the CFTC, the U.S. regulator for derivatives markets, solicited public comments on potentially moving towards a 24/7 trading model, the response highlighted where the real demand and practical considerations lie: in the crypto space. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Traditional Finance (TradFi) Crypto Markets Trading Hours Fixed, limited (e.g., 9:30 AM – 4:00 PM EST for NYSE) 24/7, non-stop globally Underlying Assets Stocks, bonds, commodities, fiat currencies Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Market Access Often restricted to exchange hours Global, accessible anytime (internet permitting) Regulatory Model Established frameworks built around fixed hours Evolving frameworks adapting to 24/7 nature This constant activity in crypto markets means that events happening overnight or on weekends can have immediate and significant impacts on prices and market conditions. This brings us to the critical point raised by Chairwoman Pham. CFTC and the Push for Real-Time Risk Management According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, Chairwoman Pham specifically noted that 24/7 trading offers clear advantages, particularly from a risk management perspective. In a market that can react instantly to global news, technological developments, or regulatory announcements, having the ability to trade derivatives around the clock allows participants to manage their exposure in real time. Think about it: if a major news event breaks at 2 AM on a Sunday, a market participant holding a crypto derivatives position might face significant risk exposure if they have to wait until Monday morning to adjust their hedge or close their position. 24/7 trading capability would allow for immediate action, potentially mitigating losses and improving overall market stability by allowing for continuous price discovery and risk transfer. The CFTC’s interest in this topic isn’t new. They announced they were soliciting public comments on 24/7 derivatives trading back in April. This proactive step shows the regulator is grappling with how to oversee markets that don’t fit the traditional mold of scheduled trading hours. The fact that the feedback focused solely on crypto derivatives underscores that the industry sees this as a necessity driven by the very nature of digital assets. Why Only Crypto Derivatives? Exploring the Feedback The revelation that feedback on 24/7 trading proposals was limited to crypto-based products and didn’t involve TradFi products is telling. It suggests that while the CFTC cast a wide net, the industry response highlighted that the practical need and infrastructure readiness for 24/7 derivatives trading currently reside almost exclusively within the crypto ecosystem. Why might this be the case? Native 24/7 Infrastructure: Crypto exchanges and trading platforms were built from the ground up to operate non-stop. Their underlying technology, staffing models, and operational procedures are designed for continuous activity. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of crypto markets makes the ability to react instantly to events more critical than in many traditional asset classes. Global Nature: Crypto markets are truly global, with significant trading activity occurring across all time zones. A 24/7 model aligns with this global participant base. TradFi Legacy Systems: Traditional financial infrastructure, while robust, is often built upon legacy systems and operational models that are deeply tied to fixed trading hours and clearing cycles. Shifting these systems to 24/7 operation would be a monumental and costly undertaking, potentially lacking the immediate market demand seen in crypto. This feedback provides the CFTC with clear direction: the immediate regulatory and infrastructure questions surrounding 24/7 derivatives trading are primarily relevant to the rapidly evolving 24/7 crypto trading landscape. Implications for Digital Asset Regulation and Financial Market Oversight What does this mean for the future? The fact that public input is steering the conversation towards crypto indicates that regulators like the CFTC are increasingly focusing their attention and resources on understanding and overseeing digital assets. This isn’t just about trading hours; it’s about developing comprehensive digital asset regulation that accounts for the unique characteristics of this market. Key areas the CFTC and other regulators will likely need to address include: Surveillance and Market Integrity: How to effectively monitor a market for manipulation or misconduct when it never closes. Clearing and Settlement: Adapting clearing and settlement processes, traditionally tied to daily cycles, for continuous operation. Cybersecurity: Ensuring the security of platforms operating 24/7 against constant threats. Coordination: Harmonizing regulatory approaches across different jurisdictions, given the global nature of 24/7 markets. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate safeguards for participants trading around the clock. The feedback on 24/7 trading is a microcosm of the larger challenge facing regulators: how to apply existing frameworks or create new ones for markets that operate fundamentally differently from those they have overseen for decades. The focus on crypto in the feedback suggests that this is where the most pressing needs and potential innovations lie for evolving financial market oversight . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Ecosystem For participants in the crypto market, this development offers several insights: Regulation is Coming, and it’s Tailored: Regulators are actively seeking input on how to best oversee crypto’s unique features. Engaging with these comment periods is vital for the industry to help shape effective regulation. Infrastructure Matters: The ability of crypto platforms to support 24/7 operations is a key differentiator and will likely be a focus for regulatory requirements. Risk Management is Paramount: The emphasis on risk management in the context of 24/7 trading highlights its importance. Platforms and participants should prioritize robust risk frameworks. Derivatives are a Key Focus: The CFTC’s jurisdiction over derivatives means that this area of the crypto market will continue to be under scrutiny and development. The conversation around 24/7 trading for crypto derivatives is a clear indicator that the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system is progressing, bringing with it the need for sophisticated regulatory approaches. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Finance Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham’s comments reveal that the regulatory dialogue around the practicalities of modern trading is being driven by the unique characteristics of the crypto market. The fact that feedback on 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products underscores the inherent differences between digital asset markets and traditional finance, as well as where the immediate challenges and opportunities for regulatory evolution lie. This isn’t just about keeping the lights on; it’s about developing effective risk management, market integrity, and financial market oversight models for a global, always-on financial future. The CFTC’s engagement and the industry’s focused feedback are crucial steps in building the necessary regulatory infrastructure for the growing world of crypto derivatives and the broader landscape of digital asset regulation .

Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is designed to bridge ecosystems, not just tokenize them. Imagine having your ETH, BTC, SOL, and $TICS all in one sleek dashboard. No more jumping between wallets, no more delays, no more middlemen holding your keys hostage. That’s the vibe here—and it’s long overdue. Let’s say a freelance designer in Chicago just got paid in Bitcoin. She needs to convert it to USDC to pay her developer in Jakarta, then stake the rest in $TICS. Usually, that’s a four-app, three-fee nightmare. With Qubetics? It’s three clicks. Fast. Secure. Controlled by her, not some custodian. Now, picture a startup CFO juggling treasury across three chains. She needs stability, efficiency, and flexibility. With Qubetics, she gets one platform to store, send, receive, and even pay team members—all while maintaining full custody and avoiding third-party risks. And let’s talk big money. A crypto fund dropping $10,000 into the Qubetics presale at $0.3370 is scooping up 29,673 tokens. At listing, those will be worth $11,869.20 (20% up at $0.40). But it doesn’t stop there. If $TICS hits $5 in the next cycle, as some analysts are forecasting, that same stake jumps to $148,365. At $10? Boom—nearly $297,000. Scarcity is real. Out of 1.36 billion total tokens, over 514 million are already been sold. Only 10 million are left. Right now, the crypto presale is at Stage 37. Over $17.6 million has been raised, and more than 27,464 token holders are already onboard. And after this? There will be no more presale—just the big leagues. The listing price is fixed at $0.40, and anyone getting in now is locking in that 20% head start. This isn’t a maybe—it’s baked in. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics brings game-changing control with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. That makes it one of the top altcoins to buy—especially before that last batch of tokens vanishes. Sui (SUI): A Stylish Start, But Can It Sustain the Heat? Sui turned heads the moment it dropped. With its Move-based smart contract language (built for secure scalability) and parallel transaction processing, it quickly became one of the top altcoins to buy in early 2023. Everyone from DeFi die-hards to NFT builders rushed in to explore what the protocol offered. Unlike traditional sequential blockchains, Sui allows simultaneous execution, boosting speed without compromising stability. One of its proudest achievements is making blockchain-based gaming actually feel fun again. Sui’s framework lets devs spin up real-time gameplay and immersive worlds—not those glitchy, lag-ridden ones Web3 used to churn out. Plus, the project is keeping the pipeline hot with its recent ecosystem expansion fund and dev grants. Still, there are cracks in the paint. While Sui offers sleek speed and slick UX, it’s still trying to find that “kill app”—the one that makes grandma and Gen Z both go, “Whoa, that’s cool.” Transaction fees have also spiked under high load, and the token has danced in and out of favour on major exchanges. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Sui shook up the scene and still holds promise—one of the top altcoins to buy if the dev traction keeps up. Conclusion Qubetics isn’t just stepping into the spotlight—it’s seizing it with purpose. As the crypto market shifts toward real-world value and practical tools, Qubetics offers a next-generation platform that combines developer accessibility, community-first governance, and seamless cross-border transactions. It’s not riding the wave—it’s engineering the tide. The opportunity here is clear for those searching for the top altcoins to buy before the next breakout. With a fixed presale price of $0.3370, a 20% ROI at listing, and analyst projections pointing to a $5–$10 post-launch valuation, Qubetics isn’t just competitive—it’s compelling. The tokenomics overhaul, limited supply, and decentralised ecosystem place it in a league of its own.

In a new press release , Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is announcing the stock offering of 11.764 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD Stock) for $85.00 per share. Strategy estimates that it will acquire about $980 million from the offering, which may give investors quarterly dividends, and intends to use the money for miscellaneous corporate expenses and to acquire more of the top crypto asset by market cap. Preferred stock offerings, which offer investors higher and more consistent returns as well as stability, are a way for companies to raise funds without weakening their voting rights. Strategy – which was co-founded by former chief executive and longtime BTC maxi Michael Saylor – currently holds 580,955 Bitcoin worth just over $60.5 billion at time of writing, coming in at an average cost basis of $40,680 per token, according to data from BTC tracking website BitcoinTreasuries. The data also shows that Strategy currently holds about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Last month, Saylor announced that Strategy doubled the amount of capital it wants to accumulate to purchase more of the flagship digital asset from $42 billion to $84 billion. Bitcoin is trading for $104,540 at time of writing, a 2.1% rise during the last 24 hours.

2025-06-07T06:20:06,"SEC ETF Approval: Firms Urgently Push for ‘First to File’ Rule Return","BitcoinWorld SEC ETF Approval: Firms Urgently Push for ‘First to File’ Rule Return The world of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is constantly evolving, marked by significant regulatory hurdles and strategic maneuvers by asset management firms. A recent development highlights this dynamic: three prominent players – VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital – have collectively addressed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a specific request. They are advocating for the reintroduction of a principle known as “first to file, first to approve” within the SEC ETF approval process. Understanding the ‘First to File, First to Approve’ Principle What exactly is this “first to file, first to approve” principle that these firms are so keen on seeing reinstated? In essence, it’s a regulatory guideline that prioritizes the review and potential approval of applications based on the chronological order in which they are submitted. Under this principle, the first firm to successfully file a complete and compliant application for a specific type of financial product, like an ETF, would be the first in line to potentially receive regulatory approval. Think of it like a queue. If multiple firms apply for the same type of ETF, the SEC would theoretically review the application from the firm that submitted it earliest before moving on to the next in line. This approach aims to provide a clear, predictable framework for applicants. Key aspects of this principle typically include: Chronological Priority: Applications are reviewed in the strict order of their submission date and time. Incentive for Preparedness: It encourages firms to be thorough and quick in their initial filings. Predictability: Provides applicants with a clearer idea of when their application might be considered, relative to competitors. Fairness (Debated): Proponents argue it’s fair as it rewards promptness; critics might argue it disadvantages smaller or less resourced firms. This principle isn’t new to the SEC’s processes but its application has varied, particularly in the complex and novel space of cryptocurrency-linked financial products. The Principle’s Past and Present Context: Before Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs As the letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital points out, the “first to file, first to approve” principle was indeed a part of the SEC’s ETF review process historically. This was the standard procedure for many traditional asset classes and even some earlier, less complex crypto-linked products like Bitcoin futures ETFs. However, the landscape shifted significantly with the applications for spot Bitcoin ETF and later, spot Ethereum ETF products. The review process for these novel and highly anticipated products seemed to deviate from the strict chronological order. While there was a rush of applications, the SEC’s deliberations appeared to take a different path, potentially evaluating multiple applications concurrently or considering broader market and regulatory readiness factors beyond just the filing date. The eventual approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously in January 2024, despite varying application dates, is a prime example of the SEC not strictly adhering to a “first to file” rule in that specific instance. This deviation, while perhaps necessary from the SEC’s perspective to ensure market readiness and investor protection across multiple potential issuers, created uncertainty for applicants regarding the review timeline and competitive dynamics. Why Are VanEck, 21Shares & Canary Capital Pushing Now? The timing of this letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital is strategic, coming after the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and amidst ongoing discussions and applications for other crypto assets, most notably the potential Ethereum ETF approvals. Their motivation stems from a desire for greater clarity, predictability, and perceived fairness in the regulatory process for future crypto-based ETFs. Here are some potential reasons behind their push: Leveling the Playing Field: Reintroducing the principle could create a more predictable competitive environment. Firms know that getting their application in early gives them a potential advantage in the review queue. Streamlining the Process: A clear order might help streamline the SEC’s internal review process, potentially leading to faster decisions once a precedent is set for a particular asset class (like Ethereum). Reducing Uncertainty: The current process, which doesn’t strictly follow filing order, can be unpredictable for firms investing significant resources in applications. “First to file” offers a degree of certainty regarding review priority. Encouraging Preparedness: It incentivizes firms to be diligent and prepared with high-quality applications from the outset to secure an early spot in the queue. Learning from Bitcoin ETF Experience: The experience with the Bitcoin ETF approvals, where multiple issuers were approved concurrently, highlighted the departure from the old principle. Firms may prefer the structure of the previous system for future filings. By jointly penning this letter, these firms are signaling to the SEC the industry’s desire for a return to what they see as a more transparent and predictable review mechanism. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Reinstating the Principle Bringing back “first to file, first to approve” for all crypto ETFs could have various impacts: Potential Benefits: Increased Efficiency: Could simplify the SEC’s workflow by focusing on one application at a time for a specific product type. Clear Timelines (Relative): Provides applicants with a clearer understanding of their position in the queue. Rewards Early Movers: Firms that invest early in understanding regulatory requirements and preparing applications are potentially rewarded. Reduced Speculation: Might reduce market speculation around which specific issuer will be approved first, shifting focus to when the first one might be approved. Potential Challenges & Considerations: Quality vs. Speed: Could incentivize rushing applications to be first, potentially at the expense of thoroughness or quality, creating more work for the SEC. Complexity of Crypto: Crypto assets involve unique custodial, valuation, and market manipulation concerns that might require the SEC to review multiple applications to understand best practices or potential risks across the board before approving any. Market Readiness: The SEC might feel a responsibility to ensure the market is ready for a new product type and that multiple compliant options are available, rather than just approving the first one regardless of how many others are close behind. Disadvantage to Latecomers: Firms that enter the race later, perhaps due to needing more time for preparation or technological development, could be significantly disadvantaged. The SEC’s decision on whether to reinstate this principle will likely weigh these factors, balancing the industry’s desire for predictability against the regulator’s mandate to protect investors and ensure market integrity, especially in the volatile crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs? The request from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital underscores the industry’s ongoing engagement with regulators and its efforts to shape the future of crypto financial products. While the SEC is not obligated to revert to the “first to file, first to approve” rule, the letter adds to the dialogue around how these applications should be handled. For investors and market watchers, this highlights the regulatory nuances behind the launch of products like a potential Ethereum ETF. The SEC’s approach to reviewing these applications will significantly impact not only which firms get approved but also the timeline for their market entry. Keep an eye on official SEC communications and reports from analysts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, who initially reported on this letter via X, for updates on how the SEC responds to this industry request and what it signals for the future of SEC ETF approval processes for cryptocurrencies. In Conclusion: A Call for Predictability in SEC ETF Approval The joint letter from VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital serves as a clear signal to the SEC: key players in the crypto ETF space are seeking a return to a more predictable and chronological review process. By urging the reinstatement of the “first to file, first to approve” principle, they aim to streamline future applications, particularly for assets like Ethereum, building on the foundational work done during the intense period leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. While the SEC’s decision remains to be seen, this development highlights the ongoing push-and-pull between regulatory caution and industry innovation. A more transparent review process could benefit all market participants by providing clarity and potentially accelerating the availability of regulated crypto investment products, but the SEC must balance this against its primary mission of investor protection.

Trump says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with Chinese representatives in London on Monday to discuss the trade deal. “The meeting should go very well. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Last month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market. But last week, Trump claimed on Truth Social that China breached the terms of the deal. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US.

According to a Forbes report published on June 5, Trump’s net worth has now reached $5.6 billion, with nearly half of his liquid assets linked to cryptocurrencies. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 — Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 With this open revelation, Trump and his family are once again on critics’ radar, who think that while Trump made millions, many crypto investors lost their money in his PUMP and DUMP schemes. It also raises questions about political holdings of crypto assets without crypto regulations in place. Here’s a swift breakdown of his crypto earnings. It will be eye-opening for many! Where the Money Came From Trump’s earnings come from a mix of token sales and memecoin holdings. The report claims he made $390 million, before taxes, through the sale of tokens from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform connected to his brand. He also earned $315 million from the TRUMP memecoin and an additional $427 million from other memecoin assets. On top of that, Trump is believed to hold up to $60 million in World Liberty Financial’s new stablecoin, USD1. Altogether, his total crypto income is estimated at $1.2 billion, with post-tax profits around $935 million. Private Dinner Raises Eyebrows Trump’s growing involvement in crypto drew more attention following a private dinner at his golf club near Washington, D.C., on May 22. The event was attended by the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token. Among them was Tron founder Justin Sun, reportedly the largest holder, with $18 million worth of tokens at the time. Sun has also invested $93 million into Trump-linked crypto projects, including $75 million into World Liberty Financial. His presence has sparked concerns about possible foreign influence, especially given Trump’s ongoing 2024 presidential campaign. Critics Question Ethics, But Profits Speak Loudly The scale of Trump’s crypto earnings has raised questions around transparency and ethics. Critics warn that large foreign investments in ventures tied to a presidential candidate could present serious risks. Investor and former White House official Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the growing inequality within Trump’s crypto venture. Citing data from Chainalysis, he noted that 58 wallets have made over $10 million each from the TRUMP memecoin, totaling $1.1 billion in profits, while around 764,000 wallets, mostly held by small investors, are in the red. Scaramucci also pointed to the exclusive nature of Trump’s May 22 event, which included a private reception and White House tour for the top 25 wallet holders, raising fresh concerns over insider access and favoritism.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trump-net-worth-boosted-by-crypto/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T05:30:41,"Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger","Bitcoin dipped to $103,450 yesterday, wiping out about $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours. Many traders hurried to sell, but the fall was short-lived. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there’s still room for more growth. Bitcoin cycles are identical… – In 2016, $BTC grew by 280%, 365 days after Halving – In 2020, $BTC grew by 550%, 367 days after Halving – Now, 416 days post-Halving, $BTC +70% — growth ahead… History repeats, here’s $BTC’s near future🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/wshX4egwbC — Klarck (@0xklarck) June 5, 2025 These percentages matter because they hint at what might come next. If Bitcoin’s history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described—after the initial rise, there’s often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle’s build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn’t offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor’s Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000—a rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch’s outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin’s price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story.

BTC Recovered $5K The business week started on the right foot for BTC, which jumped to $106,500 on a couple of occasions on Monday and Tuesday. However, it saw little success there, and the subsequent rejections pushed it south by about two grand. It jumped once again on Thursday after the ECB cut the interest rates to 2%, but was halted at $106,000. The online spat saga that transpired between the former allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, further intensified the sell-off and BTC dumped hard to $100,400 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally stepped up at this point and prevented another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover and jumped to $105,500 in midday trading on Friday. It couldn’t continue upward and now sits below $105,000, but it’s still 2% up on the day. Its market cap has recovered to $2.080 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView SUI Bounces Hard Most altcoins tumbled on Friday but have posted impressive gains on a daily scale. Still, Ethereum continues to struggle below $2,500 following a minor jump. RP has recovered to $2.17 after a 2% increase, and similar gains are evident from BNB, SOL, DOGE, and ADA. SUI has emerged as today’s top performer, having surged by almost 9%. It now trades above $3.25. In contrast, HYPE has marked a slight decline of around 2% and is below $34 as of press time. The total crypto market cap has added over $50 billion since yesterday’s low. Consequently, the metric is now north of $3.380 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-07T04:34:07,"Trump Media to Raise $12B Via Securities Offering – More BTC Purchases Incoming?","Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is planning to raise billions of dollars via a securities offering. Although the firm has not clarified its reason for the fundraising, the company’s actions in the last few weeks raise speculation as to whether a part of the fund will be geared toward more bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions. According to the filing , TMTG intends to raise up to $12 billion by offering its common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units to investors. TMTG to Raise $12B The terms of the offering will be provided in prospectus supplements filed with time. For now, TMTG has clarified that it intends to sell 84.6 million shares of its common stock at a value of $0.0001 each. TMTG will sell 55.8 million shares to institutional investors in a private placement at $25.72 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.44 billion. The company will also offer 28.8 million shares issuable upon conversion of its 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2028 for an aggregate amount of $1 billion. The company noted that it has the flexibility to sell the shares at varying prices through different channels, including underwriters, dealers, and agents. “We provide more information about how we and the Selling Securityholders may sell the securities in the section entitled ‘Plan of Distribution.’ We will receive proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Shares by the Selling Securityholders pursuant to this prospectus,” the firm stated in the prospectus. The $2.5B BTC Purchase Earlier last week, TMTG reportedly disclosed that it was raising $3 billion to buy BTC. About 24 hours later, news emerged that the company had raised approximately $2.5 billion to implement its BTC acquisition plan. The firm raised the funds by selling $1.5 billion in stock and $1 billion in convertible notes priced at a 35% premium. TMTG holds the BTC on its balance sheet, while digital asset platforms Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital provide custody for the assets. TMTG’s latest BTC purchase and the intensifying wave of Bitcoin adoption in the corporate sector are fueling speculation that the $12 billion raised will be targeted at more BTC acquisitions. It remains to be seen whether this plays out as speculated.

The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating the forecast of 125,000, which suggests the economy remains resilient and gives the Federal Reserve less reason to ease monetary policy. Despite that, former President Donald Trump continued his push for looser policy. Shifting focus from Elon Musk to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump called for a full 1% rate cut , which he claimed would act as “rocket fuel” for the economy. The Fed, however, is unlikely to act before September. BREAKING: Trump Demands Immediate 1% Rate Cut from Fed ""Despite the obstruction by Powell, our country is doing great.

That’s a dramatic leap from its original 21,000 BTC target. To fund the expansion, the firm will issue up to 555 million new shares, raising $5.4 billion , according to CEO Simon Gerovich. JAPANESE MICROSTRATEGY RAISING $5.4 BILLION TO BUY $BTC Metaplanet have stated they want to own 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027. That’s 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. They currently hold 8,888 BTC ($932M) pic.twitter.com/pb43vGOvkb — Arkham (@arkham) June 6, 2025 Gerovich believes that rising global uncertainty is prompting investors to shift away from bonds and toward inflation-resistant assets, such as gold and Bitcoin. The company’s stretch goal? Holding 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Such long-term commitment could significantly tighten supply and increase institutional FOMO, fueling upward pressure on BTC prices. Bitcoin Chart Eyes Breakout; Institutions Show Up Bitcoin’s recent bounce from $100,519 has formed higher lows and is now approaching a key descending trendline. BTC sits just above the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, a sign that momentum is building. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The key resistance range lies between $105,000 and $106,300, where horizontal resistance intersects with the trendline. Bitcoin price prediction may turn bullish upon a breakout above this level; the next upside target is $107,600. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has also returned to the buying table. His firm is launching a $1 billion stock offering to expand its Bitcoin holdings, following an initial raise of four times its target of $250 million. With BTC near $104K, that capital could translate to nearly 9,600 BTC. Trade Idea: Entry: Above $105,200 Target: $106,750–$107,600 Stop-Loss: $103,900 Confirmation: Watch for bullish engulfing candles or a break of the trendline If this level gives way, it could mark the start of Bitcoin’s next leg higher, powered not just by hype, but by institutions and nations placing large bets.

Bitcoin may be on the cusp of its most explosive growth cycle yet, according to new market analysis. The analyst argues that Bitcoin is displaying unprecedented structural patterns on its macro chart that suggest a powerful breakout, leading some market watchers to reconsider long-term forecasts that were once dismissed.
