2025-06-07T14:50:55,"Garantex Moves $15M Despite Tether Freeze, Data Shows","Despite a widely publicized asset freeze by Tether and coordinated sanctions across the world, Russian crypto exchange Garantex has managed to transfer millions of digital assets on the blockchain — demonstrating acute loopholes in the efficacy of crypto blacklists and asset-freezing regimes. According to a recent news report by blockchain forensics firm Glass Ledger, over $15 million worth of reserves linked to Garantex has been actively transferred since March, staying off blacklists by hopping between chains, using mixers like Tornado Cash, and exploiting successor platforms like Grinex. The drama began early in March, when US, German, and Finnish regulators froze $27 million of USDT held by Garantex as part of a sweeping crackdown on the sanctioned exchange. Tether's freeze, which was implemented at the smart contract level, was hailed as a crypto compliance milestone, with regulators trumpeting it as proof that digital assets can be made subject to on-chain blacklists. Garantex, in turn, directly accused Tether of ”declaring war on the Russian crypto market” and shut down temporarily, but first threatened customers it had ”solutions” for individuals with BTC and ETH. How Garantex Funds Kept Moving Later on-chain information revealed that the freeze was only the tip of the iceberg of a new cat-and-mouse game. One of the long-dormant Garantex Ethereum wallets that first raised the eyebrows of compliance experts was revived in March and collected over 3,200 ETH before it flowed $2.3 million through Tornado Cash, a highly respected decentralized mixer used to launder dirty money. The same wallet now holds $6.1 million worth of ETH, while other funds are moved on the Bitcoin and BNB blockchain. Notably, 2.2 BTC was bridged to Tron and partially sent to Grinex, which is the platform commonly regarded as Garantex's operational successor. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun summed up the dilemma: ”The Garantex case bursts the bubble of control so many still carry. $15 million freely available through dark chains and mixers is not a breakdown of law — it's a breakdown of sanction enforcement.” Their latest report details how Garantex exploited the delay between freeze statements and enforcement as well as the inherent limitations of blacklists in the multi-chain universe. The investigative trail doesn't end there. Grinex, now suspected of appropriating Garantex's infrastructure and base of customers, has moved over $1.6 billion on international exchanges in just a few weeks, according to our reporting at Global Ledger. Some of these flows directly or with intermediate hops to major regulated exchanges — raising the red flags of compliance and highlighting the danger even for platforms that have KYC and AML guidelines set up. In one case, $191,000 of USDT was sent directly from a wallet linked to Grinex to a top global exchange, and another $500,000 transfer ended up at an EU VASP in just a single intermediary wallet. What's behind these transactions? Forensic analysts pinpoint several factors: blacklist-based freezing's limitations, delays in operations in Tether's multi-signature freeze mechanism (up to 44 minutes at times, long enough for bad guys to execute withdrawals prior to the freeze taking effect), and Garantex's tactic of hot wallet rotation, use of less-regulated blockchains, and use of cross-chain bridges in order to remain one step ahead of enforcement mechanisms. Besides, Garantex's operating trends changed rapidly following sanctions: they changed address clustering, rerouted transactions to Asian exchanges like HTX and OKX, and began rotating hot wallets more frequently — daily sometimes to evade detection. Compliance Challenges and Industry Response Compliance experts now insist that exchanges go beyond the simple blacklist screening. ”You require real-time blockchain analytics, behavioral risk scoring, and active transaction monitoring,” a leading AML consultant said. ”Otherwise, sanctioned players will always find a way through.” Exchanges are also requested to strengthen onboarding due diligence, flag high-risk flows from known mixers or successor entities, and cooperate with forensics firms for timely identification. The Garantex case has once more fueled controversy surrounding the utilization of decentralized cross-chain bridges and mixers in enabling illicit finance. Although some suspect that mixers have a valid purpose for privacy, their adoption by criminals and sanctioned entities is currently surpassing the industry's ability to freeze and monitor assets, critics argue. The appearance of services such as Grinex, essentially a rebranded Garantex, demonstrates how quickly criminals can adapt, bringing technology and userbases along with them in order to evade enforcement.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9479/garantex-moves-15-m-despite-tether-freeze-data-shows,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT","News|Security",cryptocompare

The Treasury says the $10 billion operation is designed to repurchase securities maturing between July 15th, 2025 and May 31st, 2027. Buybacks allow the Treasury to retire outstanding debt early, potentially reducing interest costs and adjusting its debt profile. This big buyback comes as rising yields increase borrowing costs, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continuing to keep interest rates higher-for-longer. In an April interview with Bloomberg , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about foreign nations fueling a bond market selloff, pointing instead to investors unwinding leveraged positions. At the same time, Bessent specifically called out the Treasury’s ability to increase its buyback program if necessary. When asked whether he’s discussing concerns about the stability of the Treasury market with Powell, Bessent dismissed the notion that there’s any cause for alarm. “Specifically, did we discuss some kind of a break the glass? I think we’re a long way from that.” Historical records indicate the Treasury’s previous largest buyback happened in 2000, at approximately $3 billion.

2025-06-07T14:30:01,"Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says","According to social media buzz, the growing clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the crypto world. Musk’s public swipe at a recent spending bill kicked things off. Then came Trump’s warning to yank Musk’s government contracts. It got messy fast. And now, some believe XRP could come out on top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Elon Musk-Trump Feud Spurs Crypto Talk Musk took to Twitter on June 4 to slam what he called reckless government spending. His post warned of “serious economic risks.” Not long after, Trump fired back. He threatened to pull subsidies and contracts tied to Tesla. That response sent Tesla’s stock tumbling. Investors watched $150 billion in market value vanish in a matter of hours. Market Moves And Price Swings Based on reports, Bitcoin slid more than 5% following the news. It dropped to a low of $100,550 before finding a bit of footing near $102,400. XRP wasn’t spared either. It fell alongside other major coins, though the exact drop varied across exchanges. Traders saw quick declines, then a modest rebound as the dust settled. I believe @elonmusk will do anything to make @Ripple $XRP as a chosen one and use it on @x while knowing that @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and @realDonaldTrump will watch @worldlibertyfi and @bitcoin crashing in front of their eyes. Right, @elonmusk? — Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) June 5, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Joshua Dalton, who founded tech services firm TRIBLU, stirred the pot with a bold claim. He suggested Musk might choose XRP as the main currency for X’s upcoming payment system, X Money. Dalton argued that Musk “will do anything” to make XRP the go-to token. He tagged Ripple, Musk, US President Trump, and Trump’s sons in a single post. That move framed the drama as more than just politics—it became a showdown of crypto loyalties. Technical Fit For X Money XRP provides quicker settlement and reduced fees than Bitcoin. In 2021, Musk suspended BTC payments for Tesla due to high energy consumption and centralized mining concerns. That move proved he’s not afraid to change course when a coin isn’t aligned with his objectives. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger In October 2024, Musk even referenced XRP in a viral video. He spoke of crypto like XRP potentially resisting central control, but he did not go so far as to make a full endorsement. With X Money scheduled to roll out later in 2025, XRP’s architecture for cross-border transfers could mirror what Musk is looking to create. Some analysts point out real hurdles. Ripple still holds a large chunk of XRP, and US regulators are watching closely. Any big move would need legal green lights and deep liquidity on exchanges. But for now, the idea of an “everything app” powered by XRP keeps popping up in crypto chats.

This boom reveals growing hope that the US SEC will approve an XRP ETF by 2025. Applications filed by major asset managers add pressure on a decision-making process. As institutional interest grows, traders are noticing new presale altcoins. Discover why these events are important for the XRP ecosystem as well as the best substitute for XRP that draws in investors below. Source: fxstreet.com XRP ETF Approval Odds Soars Past 92% The likelihood of a US SEC allowing a spot XRP ETF has increased to 93% over the last month. Data from Polymarket indicates that since early May, approval chances have risen by 20%. Several big asset managers have given things more impetus. Bitwise, applications have been sent in by Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary Capital. Every lawsuit strains the SEC to act swiftly. Source: Kenny Nguyen on X Additionally, the recent XRP futures ETF launches by CME Group and Coinbase Derivatives have been helpful. Mid-May saw both products go live with notable institutional appetite and trading volume. This is evidence, according to analysts, that markets are ready for more controlled XRP products. Legal developments around Ripple also matter. The continuous settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC have helped to reduce ambiguity. Although a definitive agreement is not yet in place, recent court decisions and regulatory signals point to XRP possibly not being considered a security. This legal clarity has changed investor mood and raised approval chances. Now with odds above 92%, insiders see a likely SEC nod for an XRP ETF. Many anticipate a surge in inflows akin to past Bitcoin ETF releases should approval come about. This can inspire greater acceptance and direct fresh capital into XRP investment platforms. Although analysts are still wary about timing, the general agreement is that: The year 2025 looks to be the one for a spot XRP ETF. $300M Strategic XRP Reserve Submitted to SEC Seeking $300 million for an XRP-focused Treasury, Webus International Limited registered a Form 6-K with the SEC. Signing a joint venture with Samara Alpha Management, the Hangzhou-based company established a crypto reserve for payments made using Ripple. For its booking system and chauffeur services, Webus intends to handle quick cross-border payments with XRP. This action conforms to the strategy of renewable energy company VivoPower to create a $121 million XRP reserve and BitGo’s validation of a $100 million initial investment. From the futures market, where Coinbase Derivatives and CME Group debuted XRP futures ETFs in May, institutional curiosity in XRP has extended. Analysts from U.Today point out this trend as a major indicator that large corporations value diversifying outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Remittix: The New XRP Replacing XRP as the Best PayFi System Remittix (RTX) —-a presale crypto on Ethereum–might take front stage as the best PayFi option over XRP. Remittix allows anyone to send crypto and get local money in more than 30 countries without additional charges unlike XRP. Close to $15.5 million has been raised thus far from Remittix’s token presale; analysts estimate a 50x increase when the network opens. Although XRP ETFs show promise, Remittix could be quite helpful for regular payments and company use. Apart from its great use, Remittix has a low entrance point at $0.0781, hence its ROI is higher than XRP. Remittix is also expected to strike exchanges shortly, hence its price is about to soar violently. Final Words Anticipation is at an all-time high as XRP ETF odds exceed 92% and Webus’s $300 million reserve plan formalizes XRP’s part in payments. Still, Remittix is one improvement on XRP ETF products. Remittix provides low fees, PayFi tools, and simple local cash conversion. Remittix might be a better and more useful tool for traders and companies than conventional XRP approaches. Keep an eye on Remittix if you wish to keep ahead since it seeks to surpass XRP ETF in crypto-to- fiat payment systems.

This time, it’s a musician who made $3M selling NFTs, only to see the gains disappear thanks to taxes and a market crash. Meanwhile, meme coins keep spiking and crashing like a rollercoaster with no seatbelts. But not everyone wants to gamble with their life savings. Some investors are tired of chasing hype and are now looking for the best altcoins that actually do something useful – or at least have a shot at lasting beyond the next TikTok trend. Let’s talk about three new crypto projects that offer a smarter bet in 2025. These aren’t just meme machines. They’re platforms with purpose, backed by strong presale numbers and real potential. When the Music Stops, so Does the Money Crypto fame can be fleeting – and expensive. Just ask musician Jonathan Mann, who made headlines after selling $3M worth of NFTs through his ‘Song a Day’ project. But when tax season rolled around, Mann owed the IRS more than he could pay. Combined with a brutal crypto crash, it wiped out his earnings. His story has quickly become a cautionary tale – a harsh reminder of what can happen when profits aren’t protected and taxes come calling. For anyone chasing short-term gains in a wildly volatile market, it’s a wake-up call. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – From Meme to Machine: Trading Power at Your Fingertips In a market where fortunes can vanish overnight – Snorter Token ($SNORT) offers something rare: meme-level fun with real utility. Built on Solana, Snorter Token is a fast and secure Telegram-based trading bot that gives retail traders pro-level tools to navigate chaotic token launches. It automates swaps, snipes, stop-losses, and portfolio tracking – all inside Telegram. Trades are routed through custom RPCs for lightning execution and MEV-resistant relayers that flag scams before you touch them. Powered by the $SNORT token, users unlock perks like reduced fees (as low as 0.85%), staking rewards up to 823% APY, and access to premium bot features. The bot already supports Solana, with Ethereum and other chains on the way. Right now, you can buy $SNORT for just $0.0945 and it has already raised over $566K in the presale phase. Unlike joke coins that vanish when the music stops, Snorter’s got a real engine under the hood – and a meme-snorting aardvark leading the charge. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Turning Bitcoin from Slow Store to Superhighway Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver sub-second speeds and near-zero fees. It turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active blockchain for payments, dApps, DeFi, and meme coins. With cross-chain support from day one, Bitcoin Hyper makes fast, cheap, and scalable Bitcoin-based transactions finally possible – without compromise. Right now, $HYPER is priced at $0.0118, with over $670K raised in the presale. Price forecasts put it between $0.15 – $0.32 in 2025. That’s up to 2,610% growth. Add 20% APY staking and the math gets wild. Let’s say you buy 10K $HYPER for $118 today and stake for a year. You’d earn 2K extra tokens, totaling 12K $HYPER. At the current price, that’s $141.60. But at $0.32? That’s $3,840 – from just $118. And this isn’t just hype. Bitcoin Hyper is building on Solana tech, with plans to roll out full support for Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon soon. It’s built for builders, degens, and actual payments – not just HODLers. 3. Fluxbot ($FLUXB) – The Telegram Trading Bot Empowering Retail Investors In the volatile world of crypto, where fortunes can vanish overnight, Fluxbot ($FLUXB) offers a toolset designed to help retail investors navigate the market with greater confidence and efficiency. Fluxbot is a Telegram-based trading bot operating on the Solana blockchain, providing users with lightning-fast token swaps, sniping capabilities, and portfolio management tools. It supports both SPL and Token22 standard tokens, making it versatile for various trading needs. To enhance trading safety, Fluxbot includes a smart AI agent and a built-in RugCheck tool that scans for scams before you trade. At the time of writing, $FLUXB is priced at $0.01078, with a 12.81% gain over the past month – a sign of steady growth in a shaky market. With its user-friendly design and powerful tools, Fluxbot puts pro-level trading into the hands of everyday users. For those looking to trade smarter – not just louder – $FLUXB is a strong contender in 2025. Smarter Bets for a Smarter Cycle Meme coins like $DOGE and $SHIB still generate buzz, but more people are looking beyond the hype and asking: does this project have a real use case, or is it just noise? That’s where Snorter Token , Bitcoin Hyper , and Fluxbot come in – projects that combine meme appeal with real, working tech.

2025-06-07T13:30:59,"Bitcoin at Crossroads Amid Increased Selling Pressure, Warns Analytics Platform Glassnode – Here’s the Firm’s Outlook","Analytics platform Glassnode is outlining the possible path ahead for Bitcoin ( BTC ) amid a period of intense profit-taking. According to the analytics platform, Bitcoin is facing growing resistance after reaching a new all-time high last month. The resistance can be attributed to exhaustion from profit-taking by long-time Bitcoin holders and exhaustion from buyers who purchased earlier, according to Glassnode. Over the short term, the intensifying profit-taking could point to a distribution phase and not a fresh breakout. “Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.” Glassnode says the market is experiencing the fifth major profit-taking wave in the current cycle, with the realized profits per day having risen to $1.47 billion. “ The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25,000 – $31,000 and $60,000 – $73,000. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.” The continued selling pressure from long-term holders is raising the risk of a short-term correction, according to the analytics platform. The first on-chain support zone for Bitcoin, according to Glassnode, is around $103,700, while the second one is at around the $95,600 price. If the latter is breached, Glassnode says it could be a confirmation of a potential “broader risk reset.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,007 at time of writing.

2025-06-07T13:30:00,"State of Crypto: How Crypto Legislation Is Advancing","The House Financial Services Committee might mark up market structure legislation next week, while the Senate seems close to passing its stablecoin bill. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Legislative moves The narrative Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not. Why it matters The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen. Breaking it down Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely). On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House. ""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for."" In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago). Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then. One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued. The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer — perhaps through the end of the year. This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

2025-06-07T13:24:17,"Ether ETFs Near $1 Billion Milestone After Third Week of Inflows","U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs have now marked their third consecutive week of inflows , with recent data pointing to growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed products. According to data from Farside Investors, the funds recorded $25.3 million in inflows on June 6 alone, bringing the current 15-day inflow streak—dating back to May 16—to a total of $837.5 million. This persistent trend represents nearly 25% of the total $3.32 billion in net inflows since spot Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If the momentum continues into the upcoming week, analysts predict the current streak could easily cross the $1 billion threshold. Ether ETFs Outshines Bitcoin as Flows Diverge While Ether ETFs continue their strong run, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a dip in investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF inflows broke their previous streak on May 29, followed by a sharp outflow of $346.8 million. Since then, the flows have been volatile, contrasting Ether’s more consistent capital movement. During this period, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin in price growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged by over 31% in the past month, now trading at $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Some market analysts believe this momentum may be sustained through the current cycle. Technical analyst Crypto Eagles noted that Ether appears to be mimicking historical cycles, particularly the 2020–2021 bull run. If this pattern continues, Ether could be on track to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Analysts Push for Staking Features in ETFs Despite the promising trend, some industry experts argue that Ether ETFs still have room to evolve. One key area of improvement is the inclusion of staking features. Allowing investors to earn rewards from Ether staking directly through ETFs could improve both fund performance and investor appeal. On May 31, ETF provider REX Shares filed to launch the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs in the U.S. Although a launch date is yet to be confirmed, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that REX used “regulatory workarounds” to bring these products closer to market. As institutional interest strengthens and new innovations emerge, Ether ETFs could play a growing role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets.

2025-06-07T13:18:05,"Pepe croaks as whale exodus deepens and buyers flinch","Pepe coin price retreated this week as whales continued selling and the crypto market sell-off intensified. Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-biggest meme coin on Ethereum ( ETH ), plunged to a low of $0.00001043, down by 36% from its highest point in May. This decline happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most meme coins plunged because of profit-taking and geopolitical issues. Pepe’s crash also happened as whales continued exiting their positions, signaling that they expected the downtrend to continue. The supply held by whales has dropped to 137.4 trillion, down from the year-to-date high of 166 trillion. Their holdings have fallen to the lowest point since November last year. The Network Realized Profit/Loss metric has plunged into the negative zone, a sign that some sellers are exiting at a loss. More on-chain data shows that active addresses have slumped to less than 3,000. Pepe on-chain metrics | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, Pepe has become cheap, which may push investors to buy the dip. The closely-watched MVRV ratio with the Z score has dropped to minus 0.192. You might also like: Hyperliquid coin forms bullish pennant as momentum builds: is a breakout imminent? A negative MVRV ratio means that a coin’s market value has moved below the average price at which holders acquired their coins. It often signals that a coin is in a buy zone. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe token price has decreased from last month’s high of $0.00001622 to $0.000011 today. It is consolidating at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Pepe’s price has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.00001622 and the lower side at $0.0000052. The recent dip is likely part of the formation of the handle section of the C&H pattern. Therefore, if this pattern works out, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the all-time high of $0.00002712, about 135% above the current level. This view will be confirmed if it rises above the cup’s upper side at $0.00001622.

2025-06-07T13:01:00,"From seizure to sale: Beijing taps Hong Kong to liquidate crypto","In a move that underscores the strategic value of Hong Kong’s regulatory autonomy, Beijing has established its first formal process for liquidating confiscated cryptocurrencies—tapping into Hong Kong’s licensed exchanges to offload digital assets seized in criminal cases. The arrangement highlights the stark policy divide between mainland China’s hardline anti-crypto stance and Hong Kong’s ambitions as a digital asset hub. It also offers a practical solution for Chinese authorities to convert seized crypto into fiat currency without breaching domestic restrictions. According to a local report from Tech In Asia , Beijing’s Public Security Bureau established a disposal framework that involves collaboration with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to coordinate the sale of virtual assets seized in criminal cases. Third-party agencies will carry out transactions on licensed platforms, and proceeds will be converted to yuan and transferred to designated government accounts. This marks the first formal process established by mainland Chinese authorities for disposing of seized crypto. You might also like: Lightchain AI gains trader favor as Polygon fails to turn tech hype into real demand China’s crypto catch finds a Hong Kong exit The decision to use Hong Kong’s regulated cryptocurrency infrastructure shows a major, stark regulatory divide between mainland China and the Special Administrative Region. While Beijing maintains one of the world’s most restrictive cryptocurrency policies, Hong Kong has actively cultivated its position as a regional digital asset hub. Hong Kong’s regulatory framework allows licensed exchanges to serve institutional and qualified retail investors. This creates an ideal conduit for Chinese authorities seeking to liquidate seized assets and also maintain compliance with mainland restrictions. The arrangement shows Hong Kong’s strategic value as a bridge between China’s strict domestic policies and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Licensed exchanges in the territory can process large-scale transactions and also ensures regulatory compliance and proper documentation.

Official estimates suggest authorities control approximately 194,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 833,000 Ethereum ( ETH ). Previously, Chinese authorities lacked established mechanisms for converting seized cryptocurrencies into traditional currency. The timing coincides with global trends in government cryptocurrency holdings, as law enforcement agencies worldwide are puzzled on how to manage the substantial digital asset seizures. The United States government currently holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion, while the United Kingdom possesses over 61,000 Bitcoin from fraud investigations. Beijing’s decision to utilize Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency infrastructure shows the practical flexibility within China’s “One Country, Two Systems” framework. The arrangement allows mainland authorities to access regulated cryptocurrency markets without compromising domestic policy positions. Chinese authorities maintain that the liquidation process aligns with existing anti-cryptocurrency policies by removing seized digital assets from circulation rather than facilitating new trading activities. The framework establishes clear procedures for converting volatile digital assets into stable fiat currency and reduces storage risks and administrative burdens associated with long-term cryptocurrency custody.

2025-06-07T13:00:53,"Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback – Bulls Eye $3,000 Level","Ethereum has faced a sharp pullback, dropping over 10% in the last 24 hours as global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty shake investor confidence across markets. The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins—including Ethereum—are under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH’s ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range. The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play. Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets. ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range. Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 — a psychological and technical milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The chart shows that ETH’s recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 — a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 Volume has remained moderate, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before entering new positions. As long as ETH holds above the $2,400–$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid.

According to reports, the minister also had a meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams. According to reports inside Pakistan, the minister held discussions concerning blockchain with United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a key architect of the US crypto regulation. Senators Bill Hagerty, Rick Scott, Tim Sheehy, and Jim Justice were also present at the meeting in Washington, DC. According to the press release made available on Friday, Saqib also engaged in several discussions with members of the Financial Services Committee at the White House. Pakistan’s crypto minister discusses blockchain regulation with US officials During the discussions, he mentioned the country’s intention to be a global leader when it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain . “From Capitol Hill to the White House, I shared a new face of Pakistan: one driven by youth, innovation, and global partnerships,” he said. He also discussed the recent initiatives undertaken by the country with the US officials, including Pakistan’s plans to establish its strategic Bitcoin reserve. In addition, Saqib also talked about the steps that Pakistan has taken towards the establishment of its virtual asset regulatory framework and the adoption of stablecoins to streamline the country’s remittances. According to the press release, the country sees more than $36 billion in annual remittances, owing to its booming freelance sector. Meanwhile, in a separate meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Saqib discussed the challenges and approaches to the growing digital asset industry in the country. He mentioned that the sector opens up a high-potential market, but the country needs to be careful about how it decides to approach it in terms of regulation, so it can help it and not stifle its growth. During the meeting, which took place at Mayor Adam’s residence, Saqib noted that the Pakistan Crypto Council is willing to work with New York City to aid regulation and innovation. Crypto collaboration on the horizon in the country New York and Pakistan have both launched their respective crypto councils, as they aim to ensure responsible growth of their digital asset sector. The meeting marked a step towards direct collaboration between the two councils, with plans to develop knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and policy advisory initiatives. The visit to Gracie Mansion concluded his official US tour, which focused on blockchain innovation, public-private partnerships, and international crypto cooperation. Over the past few months, the country has set up several initiatives as it aims to regulate the crypto industry. After setting up the PCC, it set up the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp­liant and responsible adoption of digital assets. The PCC meeting held earlier this month touched on various subjects, including a draft framework to regulate the sector. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb, who also serves as the chairman of the PCC. He discussed the formation of a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, law, and IT & telecom divisions to review draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure for digital assets. The PCC also convened a meeting last week to discuss confusion surrounding its crypto policy. The development came after internal arguments over the legality of holding digital assets in the country, a stance that the State Bank of Pakistan has clarified.

Drawing from market dominance trends and technical chart patterns, Steph explores how much 2,000 XRP could be worth if it reclaims its former market position. Market Dominance and Historical Performance XRP once held a significant portion of the overall cryptocurrency market, reaching a peak dominance of about 30% during previous bullish cycles. However, its share has diminished in recent years, sitting at approximately 4% at the time of Steph’s report. In contrast, Bitcoin currently accounts for 62% of the market share, with Ethereum holding around 10%. Steph believes XRP has broken free from a downtrend that began in 2017. This shift, he argues, could mark the beginning of a recovery in XRP’s dominance and price. To evaluate XRP’s potential, he outlines two scenarios based on different assumptions about total crypto market capitalization and XRP’s possible share of it. WHAT 2,000 #XRP COINS WILL BE WORTH IN 2025 (Crazy Rich!) pic.twitter.com/odEckX57XM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 25, 2025 Scenario 1: Flat Market Cap, Strong XRP Growth In this conservative case, the overall cryptocurrency market cap remains unchanged at $3.48 trillion. If XRP regains a 30% market share under these conditions, its price would increase substantially. According to Steph’s calculations, XRP could reach $17.10 per token. At that price, a portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens would be valued at $34,200. Based on a current investment of around $4,650, this would represent a return exceeding 600%. However, the analysis acknowledges that this outcome depends heavily on XRP outperforming the broader market, which may not be likely in a flat-growth environment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Scenario 2: Market Expansion and Higher Valuation The second scenario envisions a more optimistic market trajectory, with total capitalization doubling to $6.96 trillion. Should XRP attain 30% market dominance under these conditions, Steph estimates the token’s value would climb to $34.20. This would bring the total value of 2,000 XRP tokens to $68,400, yielding a return of over 1,370% from current price levels. Steph argues this outcome is within reach, supported by increasing institutional involvement. Some financial entities have reportedly shown interest in holding XRP as part of their treasury assets, while others are exploring the launch of exchange-traded products tied to the cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Momentum Steph also highlights a technical setup on XRP’s monthly chart, specifically a double bottom formation with a confirmed breakout above resistance. This pattern, he notes, suggests a bullish continuation and aligns with the price targets discussed in both scenarios. Based on this chart structure alone, XRP could approach $30 in value, consistent with Scenario 2’s projection. While Steph’s projections present compelling upside potential, he cautions that market dominance levels are inherently unpredictable. Even if XRP reaches only 15–20% market share, the gains could still be substantial. However, investors are advised to exercise due diligence and remain realistic about market volatility and competitive dynamics.

2025-06-07T12:20:51,"Bitcoin Advocates Urge Elon Musk to Go All-In Amid Feud With Trump","As tensions escalate between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the U.S. President Donald Trump, prominent voices from the Bitcoin community are urging Musk to respond by embracing BTC more aggressively. According to analysts and industry leaders, adopting a full-fledged Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful financial and political move for Musk. “Full porting Bitcoin is the best way for Elon to get back at Trump,” wrote crypto analyst Will Clemente in a June 6 post on X. Echoing that view, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow made a direct appeal to Musk: “@elonmusk, it’s time to go all in on Bitcoin.” The comments come amid a series of public barbs traded between Musk and Trump on social media over taxes, tariffs, and government subsidies. Calls for Tesla to Resume Bitcoin Payments Mow further urged Musk to resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases—a move the company paused in 2021 due to environmental concerns. He also called on Tesla to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy to diversify its holdings away from fiat currencies. Despite discontinuing Bitcoin payments, Tesla still holds significant digital assets , which declined in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1 2024. Mow proposed that Musk extend BTC payment options to SpaceX customers by offering launch discounts for BTC payments. “Force a hard money standard on the money printers,” Mow added, in a pointed comment directed at fiat-based financial systems and central banks. The push follows growing criticism that the U.S. government has failed to act on its so-called Strategic BTC Reserve, which was reportedly signed into executive order form by Trump months ago but hasn’t yet materialized into any purchases. Musk’s Potential Influence on Bitcoin Global Narrative Some believe that if Musk does commit fully to Bitcoin, the impact would be global and transformational. Lomob CEO Boyd Cohen noted, “If Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off. He doesn’t do anything small.” Cohen predicted Musk could rapidly build the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury and influence global adoption through his companies. The feud intensified after Musk criticized Trump’s tax plan and warned that his proposed global tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession. Trump fired back by suggesting that eliminating Musk’s government subsidies could save taxpayers billions. While Musk has a history of engaging with crypto, most recently discussing BTC-style encryption for X’s messaging feature, many are watching closely to see whether he will translate his crypto commentary into action.

2025-06-07T12:05:07,"Stunning Statements from MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor – “The Price of Bitcoin in 2045…”","Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), one of the most prominent advocates of Bitcoin, announced both the company's new capital raising plans and his expectations for the future of Bitcoin on the Squawk Box program he attended on CNBC. Saylor said the company aims to raise approximately $1 billion through a 10% fixed-income preferred stock offering. The majority of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, particularly for the purchase of more Bitcoin. Saylor, who stated that they have made three different preferred stock offerings in the last six months, said that these vehicles offer high fixed returns to investors, and at the same time, the company increases shareholder value by directing these funds to Bitcoin investments. According to Saylor, this model offers “indefinite” fixed-income investments with no debt maturity and no refinancing risk. “By pairing a long-term liability with a long-term asset, we are essentially creating an indestructible balance sheet,” Saylor said, outlining the company’s strategy. He argued that this model offers both an attractive 10% yield for fixed income investors and indirectly gives equity investors access to more Bitcoin. Touching on the regulatory front, Saylor stated that the recent recognition of Bitcoin as a “digital commodity” by the US administration, the positive changes made in accounting standards, and the green light given to Bitcoin by banks show the improvement in the sector. Related News: Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details One of the most striking statements on the program was Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin forecast. Referring to a speech he gave in July 2024, Saylor argued that Bitcoin could provide an average annual compound return of 30% for the next 20 years. According to this scenario, Bitcoin could reach $13 million in 2045. Citing past performance as an example, Saylor said Bitcoin has gained 57% annually over the past four and a half years, four times the S&P 500 and eight times the real estate and bond returns. “Bitcoin is crushing everything,” he said. His statements at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference also came to the fore. Saylor reiterated that he was against Strategy’s “proof-of-reserves” application for the 567,000 Bitcoins it holds. Stating that this poses a security risk, Saylor stated that he maintained this view despite the criticisms of some Bitcoin advocates who called for transparency. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-07T12:04:31,"Investors Remain Cautiously Optimistic as Market Sees Volatility Toward The Weekend: Report","Over the last 48 hours, millions of dollars have been liquidated in the cryptocurrency market due to tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their public dispute has caused markets to end the week on a bearish note. However, a weekly report from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance indicates that investors are cautiously optimistic, with growing confidence in a soft landing and a slowly cooling economy. Still, they remain sensitive to inflation risks and signals from the Federal Reserve. Trump-Musk Feud Shakes Markets Bitcoin (BTC), which has mostly consolidated between $104,000 and $106,000 since the beginning of the week, fell below $101,000, tumbling to a multi-week low amid the Trump-Musk feud . Ether (ETH) also took a hit, briefly falling below $2,400. Besides the struggling prices of BTC and ETH, their balances on crypto exchanges recorded significant drops in the first few days of the month. Since the start of May, the metric tracking the two biggest digital assets has plummeted 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. This plunge in supply has marked new yearly lows for the balances of BTC and ETH held on exchanges. Binance believes this could be a sign of accumulation because investors are moving their assets off trading platforms. Moreover, bitcoin’s correlation with equities and gold has continued to hold. The two-month BTC–S&P 500 correlation rose to 0.49 from last week, while the cryptocurrency’s correlation with gold climbed to 0.09. ETFs Gain Institutional Traction On the brighter side, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining institutional traction, which can be attributed to some recent regulatory reforms. Towards the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance stating that staking activities on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks do not constitute securities transfers. From then on, crypto ETF providers could incorporate staking rewards into their offerings. Building on the same momentum, the multinational finance giant JPMorgan announced two days ago that it would allow clients to use crypto ETF shares as collateral for loans. Notably, Circle, the stablecoin issuer behind the USD Coin (USDC), launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm raised $1.5 billion for the IPO by selling 34 million shares at $31 each. However, the 220 million outstanding shares disclosed in its June 2 filing with the SEC said the valuation stood at $6.9 billion. At the time of writing, the firm had a market capitalization of at least $20 billion, following the skyrocketing of its shares on the NYSE after the listing.

With its oracles powering smart contracts and deep integrations across DeFi, LINK has earned its reputation. But recent long-term projections—like a modest $29.83 price in 2040—have some investors wondering if they’re aiming too low. And that’s why a growing number of Chainlink price analysts are shifting their gaze toward a new contender: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Why? Because it doesn’t just forecast growth—it unlocks wealth creation today. And it does it from the one tool every investor already owns: their phone. LINK Has Utility—But BTC-S Has Income Chainlink’s ecosystem is thriving. It secures billions in DeFi, anchors hybrid contracts, and powers financial data pipelines. But it’s primarily a backend service layer, not a direct income generator for everyday users. Bitcoin Solaris flips that model. It’s built not just for developers, but for anyone who wants to earn. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine, manage, and grow BTC-S directly from mobile devices and laptops—no expensive equipment, no technical skill, no waiting. And that’s a game-changer. The Solaris Nova App Is Making Crypto Passive Again At the center of the BTC-S movement is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, a beautifully designed mining suite that transforms the most common devices—phones, laptops, and browsers—into daily earning tools. What it delivers: Tap-to-mine setup optimized for non-technical users Seamless operation across Android, iOS, Windows, and browser platforms Built-in wallet with biometric login and encrypted keys Real-time mining stats and earnings tracking Performance-based gamification and leaderboard features Smart device-aware energy usage controls This isn’t just accessibility—it’s wealth-building in disguise. Users can begin mining without capital barriers, echoing the energy of 2010 Bitcoin miners… except now, it fits in your pocket. Deep Architecture Powering the Simplicity BTC-S isn’t only about usability. Behind the tap-to-earn interface is one of the most powerful blockchain designs in the market: a hybrid dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW, with 5-minute block times, anchored on accumulated hash power Solaris Layer: DPoS with 21 active validators, rotating every 24 hours Smart contract throughput of up to 100,000 TPS Block size scaling up to 32MB Smart contracts written in Rust, following the Solana development model Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy and compliance This dual-consensus structure allows BTC-S to combine decentralized security with lightning-fast execution, making it a true powerhouse for both developers and earners. Turn Your Device Into a Mining Machine Real Rewards: Distribution That Favors Participation Unlike tokens, where gains depend solely on market movements, BTC-S includes direct block-level rewards: 40% of mining rewards go to Base Layer PoW miners 25% to Solaris Layer validators 20% to stakers Bonus weighting based on device specs, uptime, and contribution value This creates a powerful flywheel: users mine, get rewarded, and reinvest—all within the same decentralized ecosystem. Influencers Are Paying Attention Crypto analysts and influencers have begun echoing what early adopters already know: BTC-S isn’t hype—it’s built. Crypto Legends : Broke down how BTC-S “feels like early Bitcoin all over again—except this time, it’s mobile.” Crypto Royal : Highlighted the layered architecture and validator fairness model. Token Empire : Called the upcoming app “a gateway to passive crypto ownership for the average user.” Token Galaxy : Focused on how the dynamic reward system encourages long-term engagement. This kind of influencer alignment rarely happens during presale phases, but it’s happening now. Presale Fueling the Engine Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just being praised—it’s being purchased. Over 11,000 unique users have already joined, and with over $3 million raised , the momentum is undeniable. What’s more, it’s happening under a strict 90-day schedule, making it one of the shortest presales in recent memory. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Ends: July 31, 2025 Return Potential: 1,900% Only ~8 weeks remain There’s no fluff—just utility, daily engagement, and rising demand. Security, Community, and Compliance BTC-S understands that in 2025, credibility matters. That’s why it’s already passed a rigorous audit by Cyberscope , and its team is fully KYC-verified . It also maintains strong, responsive presence across Telegram and X , where updates, AMAs, and presale stats are shared live. Transparency isn’t a feature—it’s standard operating procedure. Conclusion: From Chainlink Predictions to Bitcoin Solaris Reality Chainlink will always have a place in Web3 infrastructure. But at 5% projected annual growth, it’s not a path to overnight wealth. BTC-S, on the other hand, is engineering accessibility, income, and growth directly into its architecture, then placing that power in the hands of users. This isn’t a model built for institutions—it’s built for you. And if you missed mining Bitcoin in 2010, this time, you’re holding the rig in your hand.

Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson pointed out , “ Now that we are on the other side of the tempest in the teacup, the ecosystem can move on to higher ground with greener pastures. We have left behind slander brigades, disgruntled exes, and toxic energy vampires for Bitcoin DeFi, governance finally taking shape, Midnight, and massive advances like Leios and Midgard.” Therefore, Hoskinson is optimistic that Cardano will enter the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in full swing because it will act as a stepping stone towards driving innovation and unlocking new financial opportunities in the crypto space. This move could position Cardano as a leading platform for DeFi by utilizing its smart contract capabilities and Bitcoin’s liquidity. Hoskinson also recently unveiled Cardano’s ambitious vision , where artificial intelligence and privacy-focused sidechain Midnight will take center stage.

Analyst Brian Meredith still has a buy rating on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Class B shares, but has cut the price target from $606 per share to $591, reports CNBC. In an investment note, Meredith says the decline in the share price target is due to the expectation of less investment income as well as no stock buybacks this year and in 2026. “We continue to believe BRK’s shares are attractive in an uncertain macro environment with $347 billion of cash and [short-term] investments, a defensive business mix, and manageable tariff exposure.” Data shows Berkshire’s billionaire CEO Warren Buffett has parked $305.5 billion into the safe-haven asset class, short-dated Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. At the same time, the firm has been slashing stakes in banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America, and Capital One. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

2025-06-07T11:39:24,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Trump Urges Fed to Cut Interest Rates in Favor of Crypto","Bitcoin made a new all-time high on May 22 when it crossed $112K. Although it dipped below $100K soon after, it’s now showing signs of recovery and a potential run upwards. Carlo Pruscino from CMC Markets believes that a Fed rate cut might drive $BTC back to $112K and potentially even beyond. Keep reading to find out Trump’s stance on a potential Fed rate cut, when we can expect one, and what the best altcoins to buy are to make the most of this pro-crypto situation. Trump Wants a Rate Cut Now Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the Fed on delayed rate cuts . He said that Europe has already had 10 rate cuts while the US is lagging behind. He also pointed out there’s no inflation anymore – in case that’s what is holding back the Fed. He said that if inflation were to come back, the Fed could simply raise the interest rate again. As of now, though, Trump believes that the US is paying a lot more in borrowing costs than it should. It’s worth noting that the Federal Reserve has been mulling over rate cuts for quite some time. However, Trump’s ongoing trade tariff war and uncertain trade policies have held it from making a decisive move. The current borrowing rate is 4.25%–4.50%. As per CME Group’s data , 97.5% of market participants believe that this will remain unchanged in the upcoming Fed meeting on June 18. More than 51% of people believe that a rate cut might come around mid-September, where rates may be slashed by 25 basis points. If we see a rate cut earlier than expected, $BTC may be the first major asset to react. When…further rate cuts come, if they’re coming a lot sooner than expected, that will then impact heavily on the future price moves or crypto on Bitcoin and some other cryptos as well. – Carlo Pruscino, a CMC Markets analyst To help you make the most out of upcoming policy changes, we’ve handpicked the best cryptos to invest in . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now, Free $BTC Airdrops Bitcoin will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rising crypto market. In fact, the ‘digital gold’ is what will pull the crypto market to new highs in the first place. As such, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin, is the best crypto to buy if you’re bullish on $BTC and want to maximize your returns. Unlike other altcoins, $BTCBULL token holders will be rewarded with free $BTC. This will happen on two occasions: once when Bitcoin reaches $150K and another when it reaches $200K for the first time. Just make sure to store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events, which will take place on social media. In addition to having a genuine shot at grabbing real $BTC, you’ll also benefit from a monstrous rise in $BTCBULL’s price. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , the token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 – a 276% rise from current prices. Buy $BTCBULL now for just $0.00255 each. The project is in presale, where it has amassed nearly $7M. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer-2, Insane $45M Presale Raise A rise in Bitcoin will likely lead to joyous times in the meme coin market as well, which is why we believe that Solaxy ($SOLX) could be one of the next cryptos to explode . Designed to strengthen the best blockchain for meme coins, $SOLX is being hyped as Solana’s prodigal son, and for good reason. After all, Solaxy will finally cure Solana of its congestion and scalability issues, which it has been facing ever since the success of $TRUMP and other viral meme coins overloaded it. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which will offload transactions from the mainnet onto a sidechain. This will reduce the workload on Solana, thereby restoring its lightning-fast executions. Furthermore, this brand-new L2 will also process transactions in bulk, which will decrease the overall cost requirements on Solana. To participate in Solaxy’s one-of-a-kind mission and token growth – it’s predicted to rise by over 11,300% by 2030 – become an early investor in the project. It’s currently in presale, with over $45M raised, and you can get each token for just $0.001748. Here’s how to buy it . 3. PepeCoin ($PEP) – Pepe-Inspired Meme Coin Currently Among the Top Gainers Although you wouldn’t be wrong to think that PepeCoin ($PEP) borrows its popularity from the legendary $PEPE meme coin, it’s got a handful of unique features that have had a fair bit of say in it being one of the top trending cryptos . For instance, PepeCoin runs on its own blockchain, which is how it offers astonishingly low transaction fees and zero $ETH gas fees. Coming to its performance, $PEP is up over 3,000% since its inception in June 2024 . More recently, the token has recorded 28% gains over the past thirty days. According to price action analysis, $PEP is closing in on a major resistance level ($0.00024), a break of which could see the token soar to $0.00027 and beyond. The Best Altcoins to Benefit from a Rate Cut, but They’re Not Completely Dependent on It With a rate cut on the horizon, major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum could finally start rallying – and the altcoin space will only get more bullish. While new cryptos, like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Solaxy ($SOLX) , will indeed benefit from increased public borrowing and investment, their solid fundamentals and community hype will likely see them rising regardless. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing.

This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run. Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62% The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%. This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result. For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, “real momentum kicks in under 62%,” and this is when altcoin season moves with full force. Altcoin Season Is Not Over The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible.

For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.

2025-06-07T11:00:33,"Significant Tether Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Market Watch","BitcoinWorld Significant Tether Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Market Watch Keeping an eye on large cryptocurrency movements is crucial for understanding market dynamics. Recently, a significant Bitcoin transfer from a major player caught the attention of on-chain analysts. This movement involves a Tether -associated wallet and the prominent exchange, Binance . What is the Significance of this Tether BTC Transfer to Binance? According to data shared by the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a wallet identified as a Tether lending collateral custody wallet initiated a notable transaction. Eight hours ago, this wallet transferred 200 BTC , valued at approximately $20.88 million at the time of the transfer, to Binance . While a single transfer of this size is noteworthy, the cumulative activity from this specific crypto wallet adds further context. Lookonchain’s report highlights that since May 9th, this same wallet has moved a total of 1,650 BTC to the Binance exchange. This larger sum represents a significant value of around $174.7 million based on the approximate prices at the times of transfer. Such large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges from institutional-linked wallets are often monitored closely by traders and analysts looking for potential market signals. Why Track Bitcoin Wallet Activity? Tracking movements on the Bitcoin blockchain provides transparency into where large amounts of capital are flowing. Big transfers from wallets associated with entities like custodians, whales, or institutions to exchanges can sometimes indicate an intent to sell, increase liquidity on the exchange, or engage in other trading activities. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges can suggest accumulation or movement to cold storage. Understanding the typical behavior of specific addresses, like a Tether custody wallet, helps analysts interpret the potential implications of their actions. While not every transfer to an exchange leads to immediate selling, a pattern of significant inflows can contribute to increased selling pressure on the order books. Understanding the Role of a Crypto Wallet in These Movements A crypto wallet is essential for holding and transacting with digital assets like BTC . In this case, the wallet is described as a “Tether lending collateral custody wallet.” This suggests it holds Bitcoin that is likely used as collateral for lending operations involving Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. Movements from such a wallet to an exchange like Binance could be related to: Rebalancing collateral positions. Preparing assets for over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Making BTC available for distribution or sale. Internal management or consolidation of funds. Without explicit information from Tether, the exact reason for the transfers remains speculative. However, the fact that these funds are moving from a custody wallet, which typically holds assets long-term or as collateral, to a liquid exchange platform is what makes the event notable. What Does This Transfer Mean for the Market? A large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange like Binance is generally seen as a potentially bearish signal by some market participants, as it increases the supply of BTC available for trading and potentially selling. However, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point or even a series of transfers without considering the broader market context. Key insights from this event include: Visibility: On-chain analysis provides transparency into significant fund movements. Potential Liquidity Increase: The transfers add substantial BTC liquidity to Binance . Interpretation Challenge: The specific intent behind the transfers by Tether is not publicly disclosed, making definitive conclusions difficult. Market participants should view this data point as one piece of the puzzle. While a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange can signal potential selling pressure, it doesn’t guarantee a price drop. Other factors, such as overall market sentiment, demand, macroeconomic news, and other on-chain metrics, also play significant roles. Summary The recent movement of 200 BTC , following cumulative transfers of 1,650 BTC since May 9th, from a Tether custody wallet to Binance represents a significant flow of value onto a major exchange. While the exact reason for these transfers is unknown, they highlight the importance of monitoring large crypto wallet movements and exchange inflows as potential indicators of shifting market dynamics. This specific Bitcoin transfer activity from a wallet associated with lending collateral warrants attention from those tracking institutional or large-scale participant behavior in the crypto space.
