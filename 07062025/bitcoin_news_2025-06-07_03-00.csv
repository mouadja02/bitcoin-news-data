2025-06-07T00:20:38,"Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Can Rising Demand from BlackRock Fuel Bullish Momentum?","The post Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Can Rising Demand from BlackRock Fuel Bullish Momentum? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a similar volatility to Bitcoin (BTC) in the past 24 hours, following the feud between Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock’s ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether’s price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-can-rising-demand-from-blackrock-fuel-bullish-momentum/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The New York Federal Reserve Bank, which handles the Fed’s bond transactions, just disclosed the losses, linking them to the central bank’s tight monetary stance. The Fed’s bonds are losing value as the bank maintains higher-for-longer interest rates in a push to fight inflation. The agency says it will ensure the losses won’t hit its bottom line or cash transfers to the Treasury. “The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA portfolio has no effect on net income or Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury unless assets are sold and gains or losses are realized. Unrealized gains and losses have no effect on the conduct of monetary policy.” The New York Fed also notes the unrealized losses, which are recorded through the end of 2024, were offset slightly as the central bank let bonds mature without reinvesting. The Fed’s bond portfolio began witnessing significant unrealized losses over the previous two years, clocking $1.08 trillion in 2022 and $948.4 billion in 2023. The account witnessed unrealized gains of $354 billion in 2020 and $127.9 billion in 2021.

2025-06-07T00:00:51,"Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That’s Forming","After days of fluctuating around the $105,000 range, Bitcoin appears to be succumbing to pressure from bears and profit-taking from traders. The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head’s peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin’s daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-07T00:00:05,"4TH Stage Of Dogecoin Parabolic Curve Says $1 Is Still Possible, Here’s The Timeline","Dogecoin (DOGE) has just entered the fourth stage of a parabolic curve setup—a critical phase that often signals the potential for a major price rally. Despite recent market declines , technical analysts suggest that this stage could pave the way for explosive growth toward the coveted $1 mark . Dogecoin Eyes Breakout To $1 Dogecoin may still be on track to hit the long-anticipated $1 mark, according to technical projections from crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade. The meme coin’s recent price movements appear to be aligning with a classic parabolic curve formation —- a pattern that signals accelerating upward momentum with each consolidation phase. Based on Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, Dogecoin is entering the final phase of its four-stage parabolic curve, having just broken out of Base 3, a Falling Wedge that acted as a correction zone after previous rallies. This move is consistent with the parabolic curve model depicted in the analyst’s price chart, where price action forms step-like bases that tighten in structure and lead to increasingly aggressive upward moves. The chart pattern begins from a long-term bottom and progresses through Bases 1 to 4, each marked by periods of consolidation and declining volatility within downward-sloping wedges. The red arc drawn across the chart represents Dogecoin’s projected parabolic trajectory , which currently places the meme coin’s ascent toward Base 4. Historically, this stage has preceded the steepest price rise as investors begin to respond strongly to bullish sentiment. The chart predicts a path where DOGE, currently trading above the Base 3 breakout, could reclaim higher levels and potentially surpass $1 for the first time since its inception. Notably, the projection highlights a potential surge above $1.7 before the end of the year. Trader Tardigrade also points to a key liquidity zone in the chart, just below $0.187. A brief dip to grab liquidity here could act as a springboard, further validating the bullish thesis of a potential move to $1. This isn’t expected to be a short-term surge but rather part of a broader, well-structured formation that may lead to a major price peak . If past patterns play out as expected, a potentially historical breakout could be on the horizon. Update On Dogecoin’s Price Action Like most meme coins in the market, the Dogecoin price has been struggling to overcome bearish conditions and surge past the $0.2 threshold. Currently trading at a price low of $0.17, Dogecoin has already seen a whopping 14.14% flushed out of its value this past week, according to CoinMarketCap. In the past 24 hours, DOGE has declined by another 7%, reflecting general weakness and heightened volatility. Data from CoinCodex also shows that Dogecoin’s volatility currently sits at a high of 8.69%. The crypto data analytics platform also indicates that overall broader market sentiment has shifted bearish , with Dogecoin’s Fear and Greed Index signaling uncertainty across the broader market.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-to-1-still-possible/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Classic Parabolic Curve Formation|CoinCodex|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|meme coin|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-dead-cat-bounce-or-full-blown-rebound/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world’s leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the “Big Beautiful Bill” criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance’s net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions—particularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump—injecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher.

2025-06-06T22:36:18,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June – Bitcoin, Solana, XRP","Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins —Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them—have each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let’s explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World’s Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world’s biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto’s flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto’s future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto’s $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL’s appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76—up 1% in the last 24 hours—mirroring Bitcoin’s brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple’s Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple’s XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP’s retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin’s 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The project’s primary goal is to empower content creators with greater earnings potential, increased control over their work, and reduced reliance on tech giants that typically claim large commission cuts.

Investors gain access to a members-only ecosystem that includes exclusive content, early access features, and various perks. Staking options are also available through the SUBBD platform, offering a fixed annual return of 20%—a compelling incentive for early backers.

The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion. Yesterday, the second-biggest player in the US-dollar pegged stablecoin space, Circle, issuer of USDC, launched its initial public offering, or IPO. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL.” In its New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) debut, Circle saw an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the IPO price of $31 per share.

2025-06-06T21:01:33,"Crypto Regulation Shake-Up: SEC Wins $1.1M Fraud Case as California Trials Bitcoin Fees","This week in crypto regulation, U.S. lawmakers and state officials drew attention across the digital asset sector with developments ranging from delayed disclosures and enforcement criticisms to landmark crypto-friendly legislation in California. The regulatory environment continues to evolve, sometimes sharply divided between federal hesitations and state-level innovation. Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure In a striking development, Texas Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) came under fire for failing to disclose his Bitcoin purchases in a timely manner . Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) is under fire for allegedly improperly disclosing recent Bitcoin transactions. #BrandonGill #DonaldTrump https://t.co/JbID89ntiW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 According to a report from Open Secrets, Gill bought between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin on January 29 and February 27. However, the disclosures didn’t appear until May 30—well beyond the 45-day window mandated by the STOCK Act, which is designed to prevent insider trading by public officials. The freshman congressman’s failure to comply with basic transparency protocols has sparked criticism, particularly as lawmakers increasingly shape crypto policy. The delayed filings raise questions about oversight and ethical conduct amid the sector’s surging political relevance. Crypto advocates may see Gill’s holdings as a sign of growing interest within Congress, but his misstep shows the need for stricter accountability when digital assets enter the halls of power. SEC Chair Paul Atkins Calls Out Enforcement-First Approach Over in Washington, SEC Chair Paul Atkins delivered pointed remarks before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee this week, criticizing the agency’s previous stance of “regulation-by-enforcement” toward crypto. BREAKING SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says his top priority is a clear, rational crypto regulatory framework —….. especially around custody & $XRP Clarity is coming. pic.twitter.com/30eyZLdwEg — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 3, 2025 Atkins argued that the former approach stifled innovation and inadvertently opened the door for fraudulent behavior to flourish. “Enforcement without clear rules sends the wrong message,” Atkins said, emphasizing the need for proactive, rules-based regulation. He also praised the SEC’s revamped Crypto Task Force, describing it as a key player in developing a more nuanced and transparent regulatory framework for digital assets. This shift in rhetoric from the SEC’s highest office marks a potential turning point in crypto regulation. For years, the agency’s ambiguous stance has frustrated industry players. Atkins’ testimony could pave the way for more constructive engagement with blockchain projects—if it results in real policy changes and not just regulatory lip service. California Leads With Progressive Crypto Legislation While federal agencies wrestle with regulatory philosophy and enforcement, California is pushing ahead with bold legislative moves that could redefine state-level crypto governance. The State Assembly passed Assembly Bill 1180 with unanimous support on June 2. The bill authorizes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to create a pilot program allowing state fees to be paid using digital financial assets. Assembly member Avelino Valencia, the bill’s sponsor, called the move “a turning point for public sector adoption of financial technologies.” This marks one of the most concrete steps by any U.S. state toward integrating crypto into official government operations. Should the bill progress into law, California could serve as a testing ground for broader crypto utility in public finance, potentially setting a template for others to follow. Hot on the heels of AB 1180, another bill —Assembly Bill 1052—also cleared the State Assembly in a 78-0 vote. AB 1052 seeks to modernize unclaimed property laws, particularly how dormant digital assets are handled. JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 If passed by the Senate, the law would prevent dormant crypto held by custodians (like exchanges) from being automatically liquidated. Instead, these assets would be safeguarded in their native form by a licensed custodian. This legislation specifically excludes self-custodied wallets from its reach, a key detail for privacy advocates and decentralization purists. Together, these two bills reflect a state legislature that understands the nuances of crypto and is willing to embrace its potential while mitigating risk. SEC Secures $1.1M Judgment in Crypto Fraud Case Elsewhere, the SEC notched a courtroom win against bad actors in the crypto space. A federal judge in Georgia issued a default judgment on June 3 against Keith Crews, who was accused of orchestrating a fraudulent crypto investment scheme. Crews failed to respond to the SEC’s lawsuit, resulting in a $1.1 million penalty that includes disgorged profits and civil fines. This case reinforces the agency’s ongoing commitment to enforcement, especially against blatant scams and fraudulent offerings. While Atkins may be steering the SEC away from broad, punitive enforcement as a policy default, this judgment shows that the agency won’t hesitate to act decisively against clear misconduct. State vs. Federal—A Diverging Path? This week’s developments present a revealing contrast. On one hand, California is emerging as a trailblazer in creating thoughtful crypto legislation, focusing on utility and protection. On the other, federal lawmakers continue to grapple with oversight lapses and internal tensions on how best to regulate the space. Congressman Gill’s disclosure mishap illustrates the regulatory gaps in the nation’s capital, while SEC Chair Atkins’ comments suggest a changing of the guard in federal crypto policy. Meanwhile, the SEC’s ongoing enforcement actions indicate that investor protection remains a top priority, even as the agency explores more collaborative approaches.

2025-06-06T20:40:27,"Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld Davis Commodities Secures $4.5M Strategic Bitcoin Investment In a significant move signaling growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Davis Commodities (NASDAQ: DTCK) has announced a strategic allocation of funds towards Bitcoin. Following a successful $30 million fundraising round, the company has earmarked 15% of these proceeds, totaling $4.5 million, specifically for acquiring Bitcoin (BTC). This decision, detailed in a recent Globe Newswire press release, positions Davis Commodities among a growing list of publicly traded companies adding the premier cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. But why are companies like Davis Commodities making this move now, and what does it signify for the broader market? Why Davis Commodities is Investing in Bitcoin The press release highlights several key reasons behind Davis Commodities’ decision to build Bitcoin reserves: Enhancing Asset Allocation: Diversifying treasury assets beyond traditional holdings like cash and short-term bonds. Improving Flexibility: Gaining exposure to a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Hedging Against Inflation: Utilizing Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties in an environment of economic uncertainty and potential currency devaluation. This strategy aligns with the rationale provided by other corporations that have previously adopted Bitcoin. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The trend of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets gained significant momentum in recent years. Pioneered by firms like MicroStrategy, this movement has seen various companies across different sectors explore or implement similar strategies. While the scale of investment varies greatly, the underlying motivations often revolve around macroeconomic concerns and the potential long-term value appreciation of Bitcoin. Davis Commodities’ $4.5 million allocation, while modest compared to some larger corporate treasuries, represents a clear statement of intent and a belief in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a component of a modern treasury strategy. It adds another data point to the increasing institutional adoption narrative. Understanding BTC Reserves for Corporations For companies, establishing BTC reserves isn’t just about buying cryptocurrency; it involves navigating various considerations: Benefits: Potential for significant appreciation, boosting treasury value. Diversification away from traditional financial risks. Attracting investors interested in crypto-exposed stocks. Acting as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Challenges: High price volatility, potentially leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions. Custody and security risks associated with holding digital assets. Accounting and tax complexities. Companies must weigh these factors carefully before committing capital to Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Davis Commodities and Investors? For Davis Commodities, this move integrates them into the digital asset landscape. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and could potentially appeal to a new segment of investors interested in companies with exposure to the crypto market. The $4.5 million represents a portion of their newly raised capital, indicating a deliberate strategic choice rather than an impulsive decision. For investors in Davis Commodities, this introduces a new variable. The company’s performance may now be influenced, to some extent, by the price movements of Bitcoin. It also raises questions about the company’s long-term digital asset strategy – is this a one-time purchase, or the beginning of a larger allocation over time? Institutional Adoption Continues to Grow The investment by Davis Commodities is another piece of evidence supporting the narrative of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While retail interest often drives headlines, corporate and institutional investments provide a layer of stability and legitimacy to the asset class. Each new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to its maturity and acceptance within the traditional financial system. This trend is being watched closely by market participants, as significant corporate holdings can influence supply dynamics and market sentiment. The move by Davis Commodities, a company seemingly outside the core tech or finance sectors typically associated with early crypto adoption, is particularly noteworthy. Actionable Insights What can readers take away from this development? Monitor Corporate Filings: Keep an eye on press releases and financial reports from publicly traded companies for similar announcements. Assess Company Strategy: Understand why a company is investing in Bitcoin – is it a treasury hedge, an investment, or part of a new business line? Consider Portfolio Diversification: While not financial advice, the trend of corporate diversification into Bitcoin prompts individuals to consider their own asset allocation strategies. Stay Informed: The landscape of corporate digital asset holdings is constantly evolving. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for Davis Commodities Davis Commodities’ decision to allocate $4.5 million of its recently raised capital to Bitcoin reserves marks a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Driven by goals of enhanced asset allocation, improved flexibility, and inflation hedging, this move places the company squarely within the burgeoning trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification and long-term value preservation appear to be compelling enough for companies like Davis Commodities to take the plunge. This development further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class attracting attention beyond traditional crypto circles.

In a new strategy session, PlanB tells his 213,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is far away from reaching the peak of the current four-year cycle based on the stock-to-flow model. The stock-to-flow model is a predictive tool that assumes the scarcity of a commodity drives the price. “Bitcoin price [is] at $104,000, which is still far away from the stock-to-flow value of $500,000 based on fundamentals, scarcity fundamentals. That’s what I expect the average over this four-year cycle to be. So we’re still far away from that. But we’re also still only one year in the cycle, we have three years to go and so I think Bitcoin is very undervalued.” According to Plan B, Bitcoin is at the “very beginning of a bull market” based on historical precedent. “We made a fake loop in bull market territory after the January 2024 [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds] ETF introductions. And we’re now right back at where all the bull markets in the past have started. So it’s a very bullish signal if you ask me.” The quant analyst says Bitcoin could skyrocket by up to approximately 860% over the course of the current cycle. “[Bitcoin] is currently in a bull market, targeting… let’s say $250,000 to $1 million range for the average price in this cycle.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,300 at time of writing.

2025-06-06T20:00:38,"Here’s XRP Likely Price If Its Market Dominance Surges to 40%","XRP’s price trajectory could see significant upward movement if its market dominance rises to 40%, surpassing its historical peak of 31.33%. Currently far from this level, a rise of such magnitude would require XRP to capture a sizable share from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Historical Context of XRP Dominance XRP’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market has fluctuated notably since it first gained significant traction. After the launch of the XRP Ledger, XRP began rising in market prominence, and by October 2014, it had surpassed Litecoin to become the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. Over the following months, its market share climbed steadily, reaching 20.69% in January 2015. However, this dominance began to wane by early 2016 as Ethereum emerged as a strong competitor. XRP’s share of the market eventually dropped to 0.95% by March 2017. This was partly due to XRP underperforming during the early stages of the 2017 bull market. XRP rebounded later that year, and its market dominance peaked at 31.33% when its price hit $3.80. Since then, XRP’s dominance has experienced a prolonged decline, bottoming out at around 1.21% in November 2024. Recent Performance and Current Status Following a slight recovery in price, particularly after the U.S. elections in late 2024, XRP saw a renewed increase in market share. By January 2025, its dominance reached a four-year high of 5.58%. As of now, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.97%, with a market capitalization of $128.51 billion. Despite this relatively low dominance figure, some analysts remain optimistic. They propose a scenario where XRP could reach an unprecedented 40% dominance, well above its previous high. To achieve this, XRP would need to overtake significant portions of the current market share held by Bitcoin (64.15%) and Ethereum (9.71%). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projected Price at 40% Market Dominance If XRP were to achieve 40% dominance in the current $3.24 trillion crypto market, its total market cap would rise to roughly $1.296 trillion. With a circulating supply of around 58.75 billion tokens, this would imply a price point of approximately $22.06 per XRP. Market observers, including figures such as Oscar Ramos, have floated similar projections, suggesting that a $22 price is attainable if XRP reaches a $1 trillion valuation. However, they also acknowledge that achieving 40% market dominance in the current market structure would be a considerable challenge. Notably, XRP might not need to reach 40% dominance to attain a $22 valuation. If its current 3.97% share of the market remains constant while the broader crypto market expands significantly, say to $32.65 trillion, XRP could still reach the $1.296 trillion mark needed for the $22 price target. A July 2023 report from Forbes projected that crypto-focused ETFs could introduce as much as $30 trillion in new capital into the space, providing a potential pathway for such market expansion.

2025-06-06T20:00:07,"Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally","Ethereum has experienced a sharp pullback, retracing over 10% since yesterday as the broader crypto market faced a wave of volatility. Despite the decline, bulls are showing resilience. ETH failed to break below the critical $2,300 mark and is now holding firm above $2,400, a sign that demand remains strong at current levels. Investors are watching closely as Ethereum consolidates and attempts to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142 Top analyst M-Log1 shared a technical update indicating that ETH is currently sitting around the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart. This level often acts as a major trend indicator, and reclaiming it could spark renewed bullish momentum. According to M-Log1, Ethereum’s price action suggests a potential recovery toward the $2,600 zone, especially if bulls manage to push above the 50 and 100 MAs. This renewed interest in ETH comes at a pivotal moment for altcoins. Many market participants are now evaluating whether this consolidation phase marks the beginning of a larger move for Ethereum and related assets. For now, all eyes remain on key technical levels as the market awaits confirmation of direction. Ethereum Eyes Recovery After Market Shake-Up Ethereum is showing signs of strength amid heightened market volatility sparked by rising tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. The sharp war of words between the two high-profile figures triggered a wave of uncertainty in financial markets, prompting swift reactions across the cryptocurrency sector. While Bitcoin remains stable above the $100K level, altcoins have experienced significant pullbacks—ETH included. However, the coming weeks are shaping up to be decisive, with many investors closely watching for signs of recovery. ETH has retraced over 10% in recent sessions but is now bouncing from the lows. Bulls appear confident as Ethereum holds above the $2,400 level and attempts to reclaim key moving averages on the 4-hour chart. According to M-Log1, ETH currently sits near the 200MA, a crucial technical level that often signals trend reversals. He notes that Ethereum is bouncing exactly as expected following last week’s broader altcoin correction. M-Log1’s analysis points to the $2,600 level as the next target. A successful push toward that zone, along with reclaiming the 50 and 100 moving averages, could set the stage for a strong rally throughout June. If ETH manages to build momentum and maintain support, the altcoin market could experience renewed bullish energy. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and political risk, Ethereum’s resilience is notable. With technical support holding and confidence slowly returning, the setup remains constructive, assuming bulls continue to defend key levels. As the market digests recent events, ETH’s price action over the next few days will offer critical insight into whether a new altseason can take off or whether further downside is still in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? ETH Weekly Chart: Key Levels Hold Ethereum is currently trading around $2,475 on the weekly chart, showing signs of hesitation as it faces strong resistance near the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $2,450. Although ETH managed to surge above this level briefly, the candle is showing rejection near the $2,680 area, which coincides with both historical resistance and the upper end of the 34-week EMA ($2,499). This confluence of resistance levels is proving to be a critical zone for bulls to reclaim. Despite the recent bounce from April lows, ETH is still struggling to gain bullish momentum on the higher timeframes. The last few candles reflect indecision, with long wicks and narrowing body size, suggesting that while buyers are defending downside levels, sellers remain active near resistance. If ETH fails to close the week above the 200-week SMA, a pullback toward the $2,300–$2,250 range is likely, which aligns with the 50-week and 100-week moving averages.

For now, Ethereum’s weekly structure remains neutral-to-bullish, with consolidation above the 200-week SMA acting as a key battleground for trend confirmation.

2025-06-06T19:55:56,"‘Crunch Time’: Crypto Trader Justin Bennett Outlines Two Possible Scenarios for Bitcoin After BTC Bounces From Major Support Level","A widely followed crypto analyst is outlining two possible routes Bitcoin ( BTC ) could take after bouncing off a major support level. In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers on the social media platform X that it’s “crunch time” for the top crypto asset by market cap after recovering from a dip, noting that it could plunge below $100,000 if BTC bulls don’t step up. “Recap: BTC failed at $110,000 and $106,600 in May [and hit] $100,000 on Thursday. We had the Asia session bounce back to $104,000 as anticipated. Now, does Bitcoin fill the $97,000/$98,000 imbalance? Or can bulls reclaim this $104,000-$105,000 area? Crunch time.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also said that the flagship digital asset bouncing off $100,000 to hit $104,000 was a bullish scenario that would likely send BTC above $106,000. “There you go. Nice bounce from $100,000 support. Looking pretty bullish so far. $104,000-$105,000 is resistance today. A reclaim would be bullish back to $106,600, but it’s resistance until proven otherwise.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett goes on to note that other factors could influence the price of BTC, such as how the US stock market is doing and the dominance levels of Tether ( USDT ), the largest stablecoin in the world by volume. “Almost there, fam. Same target and path I shared for crypto on May 21st. I’m not saying Tether dominance at 5% will be the bottom for BTC, but there should be a strong reaction in that area if tested. Remember that USDT [dominance] moves inversely to Bitcoin.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,202 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

The list includes EU states, the UK, and most G20 countries but excludes the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Exchanges will only occur if partner countries meet reciprocity and compliance benchmarks. Switzerland’s Federal Council has approved a proposal to begin automatically exchanging data on crypto-asset holdings with 74 partner states starting in 2027, according to a statement issued on June 6. The exchange will be based on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The framework mandates information sharing between jurisdictions to detect offshore digital asset holdings and ensure tax compliance. Reciprocity and Compliance Conditions For Data Exchange The approved list includes all EU countries, the United Kingdom , and most G20 members, but excludes the United States and Saudi Arabia. Exchange of data will only proceed if partner jurisdictions agree to reciprocity and meet technical and legal standards set out under CARF. The Swiss parliament is currently reviewing the legal foundation for this data-sharing regime, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. The first data transmission will take place in 2027. The Federal Council stated that the same review mechanisms used for financial account data exchanges will be applied to crypto-asset reporting. Partner states must undergo periodic assessments to verify continued compliance. The update positions Switzerland among the first countries preparing to implement the OECD’s global reporting framework. Authorities said the scope of the exchange may expand, depending on the evolving interest of other countries and future updates to international standards. Drawing on lessons from the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss government is calling for measures like stricter capital requirements for big banks with branches abroad + additional powers for financial market supervisor @FINMA_media . https://t.co/zuWKbuyY5t @efd_dff @sif_sfi pic.twitter.com/n0z3Hvk5hE — Swiss Federal Government (@SwissGov) June 6, 2025 Global Compliance and Local Crypto Use in Switzerland Spar Switzerland recently announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments at all store locations following pilot programs in Zug and Kreuzlingen. The system uses QR codes from DFX Swiss’s OpenCryptoPay platform, allowing Lightning Network payments to settle instantly at checkout. Spar is the first major grocer in the country to adopt Bitcoin at full scale. While regulators are aligning with international reporting standards, merchants and consumers are advancing on separate terms, using Bitcoin for everyday payments without waiting for central bank endorsement. Switzerland now faces a dual trajectory: international compliance through frameworks like the OECD’s CARF, and internal normalization of crypto through market use. This parallel movement could test how governments balance transparency obligations abroad with decentralized payment activity at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is CARF, and how does it differ from previous financial reporting standards? Unlike traditional financial account standards, it includes digital tokens and requires identifying wallet holders and transaction data, even when no intermediaries are involved. Why are the U.S. and Saudi Arabia not included in the approved list? The statement does not detail specific exclusions. However, both countries have taken distinct positions on global tax data-sharing and may not currently meet CARF participation or reciprocity requirements. Are more countries expected to join Switzerland’s data-sharing agreements? Authorities indicated that the scope of exchange could expand based on evolving interest and future changes to OECD standards. Regular assessments will determine which partner states remain eligible.

2025-06-06T19:50:17,"US Nonfarm Payrolls Astonishingly Beat Expectations: What it Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Nonfarm Payrolls Astonishingly Beat Expectations: What it Means for the Crypto Market Crypto investors, pay attention! While your focus might typically be on Bitcoin charts and altcoin movements, key economic indicators from the traditional financial world often have a significant ripple effect. The latest report on US nonfarm payrolls is one such piece of data that just landed, and it delivered a notable surprise, potentially influencing the broader financial landscape, including the digital asset space. US Nonfarm Payrolls: The Latest Astonishing Numbers According to data compiled by Investing.com, based on information from the U.S. Department of Labor, the United States saw a stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment during May. The economy added 139,000 jobs, surpassing the market consensus forecast of 126,000. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Actual Nonfarm Payrolls (May): 139,000 Market Expectation: 126,000 Result: Beat Expectations Actual Unemployment Rate (May): 4.2% Forecasted Unemployment Rate: 4.2% While the US unemployment rate held steady exactly as predicted at 4.2%, the beat on the headline job creation number is what captured the market’s immediate attention. This indicates a potentially more robust labor market than economists had anticipated. Understanding Why This Macroeconomic Data Matters So, why should you care about job numbers if you’re primarily interested in cryptocurrency? Because this type of macroeconomic data is a critical input for central bankers, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). The nonfarm payrolls report and the unemployment rate are key gauges of the ‘maximum employment’ side of that mandate. A strong labor market, as potentially suggested by these numbers, can influence the Fed’s stance on monetary policy. Think of it this way: If the economy is adding jobs rapidly and unemployment is low, it suggests the economy is healthy and growing. In such a scenario, the Fed might feel less pressure to maintain highly stimulative (loose) monetary policy, like low interest rates or quantitative easing. Conversely, a weakening job market might prompt the Fed to cut rates or inject liquidity to support growth. Analyzing the Nonfarm Payrolls Impact on Broader Markets Historically, strong job reports like this one can have varied effects on traditional markets: Stock Market: Often seen positively as it signals a healthy economy and potential for corporate earnings growth. However, if it fuels expectations of aggressive rate hikes, it can be negative for growth stocks. Bond Market: Typically leads to higher bond yields (lower prices) as investors anticipate tighter monetary policy and potentially higher inflation down the road. U.S. Dollar: A strong report often strengthens the U.S. dollar as higher interest rate expectations make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors. The nonfarm payrolls impact is a complex dance between current economic health and future monetary policy expectations. What Could Be the Crypto Market Reaction? Now, let’s connect the dots to digital assets. The crypto market reaction to macroeconomic data is often influenced by the prevailing sentiment regarding risk appetite and liquidity. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are often considered risk assets, similar to growth stocks or emerging market equities. They tend to perform well in environments of high liquidity and low interest rates, as investors are more willing to take on risk for higher potential returns. A stronger-than-expected jobs report, while good for the underlying economy, can sometimes be interpreted negatively by risk asset markets if it increases the likelihood of the Federal Reserve maintaining or accelerating a path towards tighter monetary policy (e.g., raising interest rates, reducing bond holdings). Potential scenarios for the crypto market reaction: Initial Negative Reaction: Markets might see the strong data as confirming the Fed’s path towards tighter policy, leading to a sell-off in risk assets, including crypto. Delayed or Muted Reaction: The market might already be pricing in some level of economic strength and potential tightening, leading to a less dramatic response. Focus Shifts: Traders might quickly move on to the next piece of data or crypto-specific news, diminishing the nonfarm payrolls impact. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, not just macroeconomic data. However, ignoring these broader economic signals would be a mistake. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for macroeconomic data like the jobs report to influence market sentiment, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major economic calendar releases, especially those from the U.S. Understand the Nuances: Don’t just react to the headline number. Try to understand what it means for the Federal Reserve’s potential actions. Manage Risk: Macroeconomic uncertainty can increase volatility. Ensure your portfolio is aligned with your risk tolerance. Look Beyond the Short Term: While macro data can cause short-term price swings, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. The beat in US nonfarm payrolls for May serves as a fresh reminder that the health of the traditional economy and the actions of central banks are intertwined with the performance of digital assets. The nonfarm payrolls impact is real, even in the decentralized world. Summary: Connecting Jobs Data to Your Crypto Portfolio The May US nonfarm payrolls report showed a stronger labor market than anticipated, adding 139,000 jobs compared to forecasts of 126,000, while the US unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%. This positive economic signal, derived from key macroeconomic data , has implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. Because monetary policy affects liquidity and risk appetite, the nonfarm payrolls impact extends to markets like cryptocurrency. While the immediate crypto market reaction can be complex and depend on broader sentiment, understanding this connection is vital for navigating the digital asset space effectively. It underscores the importance of viewing the crypto market not in isolation, but as part of a larger global financial ecosystem influenced by traditional economic forces.

2025-06-06T19:40:45,"Czech Minister of Finance will not resign over the recent Bitcoin scandal","Czech Republic’s Minister of Finance, Zbyněk Stanjura, has refused to resign in response to calls from the opposition to share responsibility over a controversial Bitcoin donation that already cost his colleague Pavel Blažek the post of Minister of Justice. A parliamentary session devoted to the politically damaging incident was adjourned without completing the debate. Opponents of the government have threatened a no-confidence vote and urged for Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s resignation, too. Finance Ministry has nothing to do with Blažek’s Bitcoin, says Stanjura The Czech Republic was rattled by an unprecedented scandal, charged enough to bring down the cabinet of the center-right SPOLU (“Together”) coalition, or at the very least negatively affect its chances in the upcoming elections in October. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek was forced to quit his seat over his key role in the case. It was revealed that his department had accepted 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in cryptocurrency as a donation from a former darknet market operator and convicted drug dealer, Tomáš Jiřikovský. Another member of the government in Prague, Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, has now rejected calls for his resignation. Quoted by the Czech news agency CTK, he emphasized he had not violated the law and insisted that the Ministry of Justice was responsible for handling the gifted Bitcoin. On Thursday, Stanjura took to X to explain his take on Blažek’s embarrassing move, stressing that his own department was not involved in the decision to accept the crypto. Kauzu bitcoin vnímám jako selhání ministra Blažka a jeho úřadu. A znovu opakuji, že @MinFinCZ s celým procesem ani rozhodnutím @SpravedlnostCZ přijmout miliardu od drogového dealera nemělo nic společného – a ani nemá žádnou pravomoc takové kroky jiného resortu schvalovat nebo… — Zbyněk Stanjura (@Zbynek_Stanjura) June 5, 2025 However, commenting for Czech media, the finance minister admitted he knew about Blažek’s intentions to take the coins, claiming he tried to convince him not to do it. Speaking to the Seznam Zprávy news website, Stanjura stated he “saw the potential political problem” but could not prevent it. In an address to lawmakers earlier this week, Czech President Petr Pavel also described the scandal as a “major problem” which tarnishes the country’s reputation abroad. According to a report by the public radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas ( ČRo ), the Ministry of Justice has already sold part of the donated crypto assets in auctions held between March and May this year, the first such sale conducted by a public body in the country. Czech parliament holds extraordinary session over controversial crypto donation On Thursday, the Bitcoin scandal hit the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czechia’s parliament, but the prolonged debate, abundant with political statements and clashes, produced little results. Attempts to continue the extraordinary session on Friday failed and it’s unclear when it will resume. Political forces challenging the government, including the largest opposition party, the right-wing populist ANO (“Yes”), called for the resignation of the whole Fiala cabinet. Led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, ANO has already gathered enough signatures to initiate a vote of no confidence . Both the current head of government and his outgoing justice minister acknowledged that taking the Bitcoin was a “mistake.” Petr Fiala said accepting the donation without verification was “at least ethically problematic,” while Pavel Blazek apologized but rejected accusations of corruption. This wasn’t enough for the opposition and the Mayors and Independents (STAN) faction demanded that the incoming Minister of Justice Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS), describe in detail how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the state and identify all responsible persons. Meanwhile, the Czech Cryptocurrency Association took the opportunity to slam the government for the misstep. It said in a statement that by accepting the coins, “the state failed to comply with the basic requirements that any entity subject to the European MiCA regulation or the Anti-Money Laundering Act must follow.” Czech authorities neglected all precautionary measures that should apply to donations of any size, such as identifying the donor and their motives, establishing the origin of the funds as well as assessing the potential risk of links to crime, the industry organization stressed.

Strategy Upsizes Stock Offering To $1 Billion According to a June 6 press release , the Bitcoin treasury company will sell 11.76 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), expecting to bring in an estimated $979.7 million after fees and expenses. STRD, which comes after Strategy’s other preferred offerings STRF and STRK, will be offered to the public at $85 per share, with the sale set to close on June 10. Strategy said the product will pay professional and institutional investors a 10% non-cumulative dividend. The company plans to use the almost $1 billion in net proceeds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” “It’s our high-yield credit instrument,” Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a video that he posted on X earlier this week while referencing STRD. “Compared to STRK or STRF, it should be a higher-yielding preferred instrument.” During a presentation, Saylor shared a graphic indicating that STRD, which is listed on the Nasdaq, has “limited” sensitivity to the price of Bitcoin. In terms of senior status, STRD investors rank behind STRF and STRK’s holders, but they come before common shareholders. “STRD represents the fourth gear in our Bitcoin engine,” he continued. “The point of our engine is to generate BTC torque via surgical management of our [at-the-money offering programs].” Strategy now holds an eye-popping 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, bought at an average price of $70,023 per coin. That’s the equivalent of almost 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. At the apex crypto’s current price of $105,063, the $1 billion would allow the Bitcoin development company to purchase an additional 9,518 BTC, considerably more than its latest purchase of 705 Bitcoin for $75.1 million announced on June 2.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-takes-a-shot-at-the-moon-with-latest-1-billion-bitcoin-buying-tactic/,"BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
