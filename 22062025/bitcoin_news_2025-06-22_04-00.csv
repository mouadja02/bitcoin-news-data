2025-06-22T01:30:14,"Top Analyst Names XRP, Bitcoin, and Aptos as 2025’s Most Balanced Portfolio Holdings for Long-Term Investors","In a market marked by uncertainty and shifting regulatory winds, one leading analyst has pinpointed three digital assets—XRP, Bitcoin, and Aptos—as the cornerstones of a diversified, long-term crypto portfolio for 2025. Good year for XRP XRP’s path in 2025 has been defined by its legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple’s big win over the SEC this spring really changed the game for XRP. After agreeing to a settlement—yes, there was a fine, but Ripple also got back a chunk of its escrowed funds and saw those restrictive court orders lifted—suddenly the path to U.S. markets feels a lot clearer. You can practically feel the doors opening: futures-based XRP ETFs are already trading, and the buzz around a spot ETF approval grows louder every day. Investors who had been on the sidelines seem ready to jump back in, and charts are showing that once XRP pushes through its next hurdle, we could be looking at a fresh wave of buying. In short, the regulatory fog has lifted, and XRP is poised to be one of the first beneficiaries. Importantly, Ripple’s sustained accumulation of XRP on its balance sheet and its cooperative stance toward regulators underscore the company’s commitment to fostering a compliant, widely embraced payment network. Bitcoin BTC is The Bedrock of Crypto Portfolios Bitcoin is still the go-to when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Even with the headlines swirling about geopolitical unrest, it’s held steady above key price levels—proof that investors see it as a reliable anchor in a choppy market. Long-term projections for Bitcoin hinge on its dual role as both a digital store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic turbulence. Major financial institutions continue to allocate a fraction of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, while emerging investment vehicles—such as debt securities backed by BTC—have broadened market access. Technical analysts observe that Bitcoin is consolidating within a well-defined trading range; a sustained breakout to the upside could ignite fresh buying interest from both retail and professional investors. Moreover, the limited supply mechanism coded into Bitcoin’s protocol bolsters its scarcity narrative. As adoption deepens in sectors ranging from corporate treasuries to central bank experiments, Bitcoin’s position as the leading, most secure blockchain protocol remains unchallenged. For those building a core digital-asset holding, no alternative combines liquidity, brand recognition, and regulatory headroom quite like Bitcoin. Aptos: Innovation at the Vanguard of Layer-1 Blockchains Aptos has carved out a reputation as one of 2025’s most dynamic Layer-1 networks. Backed by performance-driven architecture and a growing roster of DeFi and data-feed integrations, Aptos offers both scalability and developer-friendly tooling. Recent months have seen the network integrate industry-standard oracles and onboard major lending protocols into its testnet environment, underscoring its commitment to robust, real-world use cases. Beyond purely technical metrics, Aptos has made strategic moves on the corporate front—acquiring overseas development teams and establishing regional outposts to foster deeper partnerships. Its leadership’s willingness to engage directly with regulators, including scheduled appearances before key U.S. legislative committees, signals a mature approach to compliance and governance. For long-term investors, Aptos represents exposure to next-generation blockchain capabilities that aim to support high-throughput applications without sacrificing security. As the network transitions token standards and expands its asset base, early adopters of Aptos stand to benefit from both protocol-level upgrades and ecosystem growth. Why investors want in on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as a standout in the 2025 altcoin cycle.The project cemented its token model by finalizing a fixed supply and reopening its presale to renewed investor interest. With a HashEx-audited smart contract and a pledge of 100% community ownership—free of venture capital control—the project emphasizes transparency and grassroots engagement. Upcoming staking rewards promise to deepen utility and incentivize long-term holding, reinforcing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s appeal as an early-stage opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exposure to innovative tokenomics and community-driven governance, rounding out a strategy designed for sustained performance in 2025 and beyond. Analysts are already projecting 40x-70x ROI by the end of the year. Final Thoughts- Portfolio Implications for Long-Term Investors By combining regulatory-cleared XRP, time-tested Bitcoin, growth-oriented Aptos, and innovative MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can achieve a diversified and balanced crypto allocation. Each asset brings a distinct catalyst profile, ranging from legal milestones and technical consolidation to ecosystem expansion.

2025-06-22T01:00:17,"Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500–$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone – Details","Since hitting a new all-time high almost a month ago, Bitcoin has done little to assure investors of intent to explore new price territories. Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500–$97,000: Bitcoin’s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin’s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 – $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 – $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,753 with a cumulative 1.27% decline in the past week. During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the “digital gold” continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

2025-06-22T00:09:13,"Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and Solana crash as US drops bombs on Iran's nuclear sites","Bitcoin crashed below six figures for the first time in over a month on Saturday, falling to $99,822, after US President Donald Trump announced American fighter jets had bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote : “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The impact on crypto was instant. Traders dumped risk as the US joined Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign against Iran. The market panic came after days of speculation that Washington would side with Tel Aviv following Israel’s unilateral strike on Iranian territory — once again citing half a century of unproven nuclear weapons claims. The new US airstrikes have now confirmed its involvement. XRP drops, Ether struggles, Solana hit hardest As Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line, XRP dropped to $1.8, a 3.1% hit. Ether fell to $2,201, while Solana tumbled harder than the others, now sitting at $121, down over 5%. These moves erased all gains from earlier in the week. Meanwhile shortly after Trump’s post, Israel said it had killed Saeed Izadi, a senior commander in Iran’s Quds Force, during an airstrike on an apartment in Qom. Defense Minister Israel Katz called Izadi’s killing “a major achievement,” claiming he had supplied weapons and money to Hamas before its October 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza. Izadi had been on both US and British sanctions lists. While Israeli forces targeted Izadi in Qom, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed that five of its members died in separate strikes on Khorramabad, though Izadi was not named in their statement. Iranian outlets reported that a 16-year-old was killed and two others wounded in the Qom strike. Iranian state news agency Nour News said that 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured inside Iran since Israel began bombing on June 13. In retaliation, Iranian missile strikes have killed 24 civilians in Israel, according to Israeli officials. The air war is now dragging both sides into their worst conflict in decades. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said there will be no negotiations with Washington as long as the attacks continue. Speaking in Istanbul during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Araqchi said, “It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US.” A day earlier, Araqchi had met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in a last-ditch diplomatic attempt. That effort appears dead now. Trump, speaking Friday, said he would decide “within two weeks” whether to send more US forces to the conflict, depending on whether “people come to their senses.” He also claimed Iran could build a nuclear weapon in weeks, saying, “We can’t let that happen.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Fars News Agency reported that Israel struck the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the country’s most important atomic sites. It said there were no radioactive leaks, but damage assessments are still underway. Israel also said it launched a wave of attacks on missile storage and launch infrastructure, hitting multiple locations across Iran in a wider campaign.

2025-06-22T00:00:01,"Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms","According to an analysis posted on X by CRYPTOWZRD, Chainlink has closed the session with a bearish tone and is now testing the key $12.50 support level. With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token’s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin’s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market’s continued sensitivity to BTC’s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short‑lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin’s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower‑time‑frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK’s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market’s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85—marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

2025-06-21T23:45:37,"Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities? Read This Report First","Cryptocurrency crime may be evolving, but the share of illicit such transactions remains strikingly small. According to TRM Labs’ latest annual report on crypto crime, just 0.4% of all digital asset transaction volume in 2024 was linked to unlawful activity, marking a 51% drop from the previous year despite a surge in the overall market. Illicit Crypto Activity Plummets Even as Total Volume Soars According to the blockchain intelligence firm, the total transaction volume in the crypto sector increased by 56% last year, surpassing $10.6 trillion. However, estimated illegal flows fell sharply to around $45 billion, down from nearly $59 billion in 2023. The report indicated that crypto crime was mainly dominated by sanction evaders, scammers, and funds linked to blocklisted addresses. Collectively, these categories represented over 85% of the illicit volume identified by TRM. Additionally, networks like Tron, Ethereum, and Bitcoin remained the top venues for such activity. Interestingly, while Tron alone accounted for 58% of all criminal flows, its illicit transaction volume actually fell by half compared to 2023. TRM attributed some of this success to the effectiveness of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a pioneering public-private initiative targeting USDT misuse on Tron. Since its launch, it has helped freeze over $130 million , and nearly 20% of blocklisted USDT on Tron has already been returned to victims or authorities. Meanwhile, targeted sanctions against major Russian and Iranian exchanges such as Garantex and Nobitex, recently the target of a $49 million hack , have throttled inflows to restricted jurisdictions by 33%. Persistent Threats and the Evolving Criminal Playbook Despite the overall decline, TRM raised the alarm on emerging trends demanding vigilance. It stated that terrorism financing, particularly involving groups like ISIS-Khorasan (ISKP), is increasingly relying on crypto, with stablecoins remaining the primary choice despite a growing interest in privacy coins like Monero (XMR). Hacks also witnessed an uptick, with $2.2 billion stolen, representing a 17% increase, primarily targeting DeFi protocols. As has been reported by other researchers, North Korean actors were disproportionately responsible, stealing nearly $800 million using sophisticated methods, often focusing on private key theft. In addition, their laundering tactics have adapted, utilizing decentralized bridges and moving funds rapidly across chains to make recovery exceptionally difficult for law enforcement. But perhaps the most worrisome emerging threat is the rapid adoption of AI by fraudsters. According to TRM, criminals are now using large language models (LLMs) to craft highly personalized scam personas, generate convincing deepfake videos for extortion and investment scams, and produce sophisticated phishing messages. They are also using AI to create fake IDs to bypass KYC, and even generate non-consensual explicit imagery. The blockchain research firm is expecting a significant expansion of AI-powered crime in 2025. The post Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities?

2025-06-21T23:30:40,"SHIB Price Forecasts from $0.01 to $1: Here are Likely Timelines","Shiba Inu continues to attract interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and market analysts, despite its current underperformance. Some remain optimistic about the token’s long-term prospects, envisioning potential price milestones as high as $0.01 or even $1. While these forecasts are ambitious, proponents cite past market behavior and future project developments as reasons to remain hopeful. Current Market Standing The token is currently trading at $0.00001105, showing a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.17% decline in the last week. Over the last 30 days, the token has lost 27.98% of its value. According to CoinMarketCap , SHIB holds the 19th position among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of approximately $6.7 billion. Despite recent losses, long-term supporters believe SHIB could still achieve substantial gains, referencing its explosive growth during the 2020–2021 bull run when it surged by over 150,000,000%. Among the SHIB community, the possibility of the token reaching $0.01 is often referred to as the “one-cent dream.” Achieving this would require an increase of over 87,000% from its current price. However, such a price would give SHIB a market valuation of nearly $5.89 trillion, an amount that far exceeds the current total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. Luis Delgado, a market observer, has expressed optimism about this possibility. He believes that upcoming initiatives from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, could potentially drive significant upward momentum. Delgado has stated that SHIB was conceptually designed to reach around the $0.01 level and maintains that long-term market dynamics could support this goal. Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, known as Lucie, has also echoed this sentiment. While she acknowledged that achieving $0.01 would require time, she emphasized that it remains a realistic target given sufficient development and market support. Possibility of Reaching $1 A $1 price point for SHIB is considered even more improbable by most analysts, as it would require a surge of nearly 8.8 million percent. At this valuation, SHIB’s market cap would exceed $589 trillion, significantly surpassing the value of global financial assets and even the total money supply, which was estimated at $129 trillion in Q2 2024. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Still, the $1 forecast is occasionally discussed within the community. CoinW , a cryptocurrency exchange, included SHIB’s potential rise to $1 in a recent public poll alongside other bullish predictions for major cryptocurrencies. Lucie also referenced ChatGPT’s view that a $1 price, while extremely challenging, is not entirely impossible if several favorable conditions align, including widespread adoption, extensive token burns, and a strong bull market. However, many analysts disagree. TradeCityPro , a contributor on TradingView, considers the $1 goal unrealistic due to the market cap implications. Similarly, Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie noted that SHIB will not reach such extreme valuations unless a large portion of its supply, currently at 589.25 trillion tokens, is removed from circulation. Forecast Timelines Neither Delgado nor Lucie has provided specific timelines for when SHIB might reach $0.01 or $1. To address this gap, predictions from platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon offer some guidance. According to Changelly, SHIB could reach the $0.01 mark by September 2040. Telegaon shares a similar estimate, projecting that SHIB may hit $0.08 by the end of 2040 and could even surpass $1 by 2050, reaching up to $1.06 under highly favorable circumstances. While there is a strong base of support for optimistic price targets, reaching $0.01 or $1 would require unprecedented market movements or a dramatic reduction in Shiba Inu’s circulating supply. As it stands, these milestones remain speculative and should be viewed with caution. The feasibility of such growth hinges on fundamental changes in tokenomics, adoption rates, and broader market dynamics.

2025-06-21T23:30:24,"Can Solana and Bitcoin Match the Growth Outlook of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x Projections?","While Bitcoin and Solana continue to hold commanding positions in the digital asset landscape, a rising force is drawing sharper focus from strategic investors and analysts alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its early momentum accelerating and buyer interest increasing daily, the question now is whether legacy giants like BTC and SOL can keep pace with the explosive growth forecasted for this high-potential altcoin. Bitcoin trades firmly above $105,000, bolstered by inflows into its spot ETFs and increasing alignment with institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem is evolving rapidly, preparing for a groundbreaking Alpenglow upgrade that could push transaction finality into sub-second territory. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding its narrative — not by replacing Bitcoin or Solana, but by carving out a distinct lane of ROI-focused opportunity that’s becoming difficult to ignore. Demand Is Shifting as Strategic Investors Seek Asymmetric Upside The high-cap status of Bitcoin and Solana means their growth potential is now largely tied to macro trends, ETF flows, and network upgrades. Bitcoin’s recent policy boost — with the U.S. government establishing a strategic crypto reserve funded by seized assets — signals strong top-down support. Likewise, Solana’s institutional traction is reflected in its $250M USDC minting and over $7.9M in daily network revenue. But that level of stability comes with a trade-off: reduced explosive upside. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With thousands already gaining early access, crypto insiders say it’s becoming one of the most actively watched projects of the year. Analysts tracking wallet behavior report surging participation in private access rounds, suggesting high conviction among early buyers. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outrun the Top Layer-1s Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. Its upcoming Alpenglow upgrade — replacing Proof-of-History with Rotor and Votor layers — is expected to slash finality times from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. This positions SOL as a powerful platform for gaming, trading, and on-chain finance. In parallel, Ethereum-native developers are entering the Solana ecosystem through Solidity tooling enhancements, creating further developer momentum. Bitcoin, for its part, remains a macro asset favorite. The passage of the GENIUS Act and the executive order for a strategic crypto reserve — including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP — further elevates its institutional status. ETF inflows exceed $36 billion, outperforming even gold since launch. Still, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may outperform every token this cycle due to its current positioning. With no venture capital dilution, a capped supply, and fully audited smart contracts, the foundation is being laid for what some traders describe as a “top-tier asymmetric opportunity.” High-Volume Buyers Signal What’s Coming As Solana processes tens of millions in staking activity and stablecoin volume, and Bitcoin garners support from firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, the volume metrics for MAGACOIN FINANCE tell a different story — one of breakout positioning. Crypto trackers have flagged recurring early buys and aggressive tiered entry in recent rounds, indicating confidence that extends beyond retail speculation. The structure of its entry model — including time-sensitive access mechanics — has created urgency among investors aiming to get positioned before major listings. Some early-stage analysts have pointed to similar early accumulation patterns observed in previous cycles, just before top-performing altcoins exploded. Whether that trajectory repeats remains to be seen, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has certainly established itself as a project with a sharp growth vector. Is This the Altcoin That Breaks Out in 2025? Bitcoin and Solana offer massive scale and global name recognition. Bitcoin is being labeled “digital gold” again, as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty steer investors toward hard assets. Solana, with its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and $13 billion in stablecoin value, continues to attract developers, projects, and institutional transactions at an impressive rate. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is not aiming to compete with scale — it’s targeting velocity. Momentum. Early access ROI. With every forecast, every chart, and every tracked buyer position, the evidence points in one direction: up. Strategic buyers aren’t waiting for a green light — they’re already in. As analysts run models for the second half of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being placed in an elite category of potential altcoin outperformers. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana remain pillars of strength in the ever-evolving crypto market. BTC’s alignment with macro policy and ETF success has solidified its reputation as a hedge asset, while Solana continues to set technical benchmarks with its high-speed performance and institutional utility. Yet, the landscape of opportunity is changing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a category-defining asset, not because it mimics the giants, but because it follows a different playbook. With strong early participation, analyst endorsements, and high-volume buy-ins accelerating, it’s no longer just an altcoin to watch — it’s one to act on. For investors seeking sharp upside, well-structured tokenomics, and early positioning before public listing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention. The movement has started — and it’s unfolding in real time.

2025-06-21T23:00:26,"Security Alert: CoinMarketCap Identifies And Eliminates Rogue Wallet Scam","CoinMarketCap tackled a security scare on its website this week when a fake popup urged users to “Verify Wallet.” The alert first appeared on Friday, prompting worries that hackers had slipped malicious code into the site. Within about three hours, CoinMarketCap said it had removed the offending script and began a deeper review of its system. Malicious Popup Hits Site According to CoinMarketCap’s post on its official X account, the popup was not part of any planned update. Based on reports from users on social media, it asked visitors to connect their wallets and approve ERC‑20 token transactions. That kind of prompt can lead to wallet theft or unwanted transfers if people click through. CoinMarketCap warned everyone not to connect their wallets until the issue was fixed. Update: We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 Wallet Extensions Sound Alarm MetaMask and Phantom, two popular browser‑based crypto wallets, flagged the page as unsafe almost immediately. A crypto user noted that Phantom’s extension showed a warning stating the site was “unsafe to use.” Those built‑in alerts likely saved many users from falling for the scam, since both wallets routinely check for suspicious code before letting you sign any requests. User Data At Risk Based on reports from crypto community members, the popup specifically asked for approvals that could give hackers control over tokens in affected wallets. Phishing scams like this thrive on tricking users into handing over private keys or signing away permissions. CoinMarketCap’s quick action stopped the popup, but it serves as a reminder that even top sites can be targets. Past Security Breach Looms This isn’t the first time CoinMarketCap has faced a breach. Back in October 2021, hackers stole over 3 million email addresses from the site. Those emails later appeared on hacking forums and were flagged by Have I Been Pwned. Now, almost four years later, a new attack vector—injecting code rather than stealing data—shows how threats keep changing. Calls For Stronger Security CoinMarketCap said its team is “continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security.” It did not share a full timeline for its audit, but noted that users should stay alert for any future alerts on X or other channels. Security experts say adding multi‑factor checks on code changes and regular scans for injected scripts can cut down on risks. Advice For Crypto Users Experts recommend that users treat any unexpected “connect wallet” prompt with suspicion, even on trusted sites. Using hardware wallets or browser extensions that clearly list requested permissions can help you spot shady prompts. Keeping your browser and wallet software up to date is equally key. In the fast‑moving world of crypto, personal caution remains one of the best defenses.

But prominent attorney Bill Morgan has publicly cast doubt on these rumors. Is The US Planning To Seize Ripple’s Escrowed XRP? According to widely followed crypto analyst John Squire, the United States government could potentially take control of the XRP tokens currently held in Ripple’s escrow. This revelation comes at a significant time, following President Donald Trump’s previous confirmation of plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile holding cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple’s XRP. However, Bill Morgan refuted claims that the US government intends to utilize XRP as part of a broader strategy to support its financial system. “No it won’t,” Morgan asserted in a post on X. Another industry commentator, going by the online alias Pumpius , also informed his X followers about the rumors about the US authorities potentially repurposing Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of the national financial reserves. Pumpius compared the XRP scenario to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were once considered unlikely but ultimately became a reality, indicating that the Ripple-affiliated crypto could make its way to US reserves. Notably, the longstanding Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, spurring optimism within the community. Regulatory clarity on XRP’s legal status is stirring speculation about its potential inclusion. A host of companies have in recent months announced reserves of the Ripple-created cryptocurrency. Singapore-based Web3 company Trident Digital announced it will start a strategic XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Others like Webus, VivoPower, and Wellgistics have also announced XRP-centric reserves. These moves are indicative of growing institutional interest in Ripple’s XRP ecosystem. While Ripple’s technology is gaining traction among corporations, claims related to US reserves remain unsubstantiated. The fourth-largest crypto is down 1.1% in the past 24 hours, alongside a slight correction in the broader crypto market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-inclusion-reports-in-u-s-national-reserve-reaches-fever-pitch-as-prominent-attorney-pushes-back/,"ADA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T22:14:04,"Norway Places Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining Data Centres to Prioritise Productive Industries","Norway announced plans to ban new data centres, purpose-built for crypto mining, to conserve electricity for more productive businesses, such as industries that employ more Norwegians and improve the country’s economy. Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies use substantial electricity to validate their ecosystems. In April 2024, the Norwegian government announced plans to restrict data centres to focus resources on more productive forms of work. Norway’s digitisation Minister, Karianne Tung, said the initiative aimed to control and limit undesirable projects such as crypto mining. Terje Aasland, Energy Minister for Norway, said that the main impetus for temporarily banning crypto mining data centres was meeting the nation’s climate targets. Aasland said crypto mining was incompatible with the government’s climate targets because the technology uses excess electricity and doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the nation’s long-term investments. Norway has a history of cracking down on crypto mining. In 2022, the government proposed ending tax incentives for the crypto mining industry, forcing the sector to pay the standard rate for electricity. Trygve Slagsvold, Finance Minister for Norway, said the move was about prioritising energy to benefit the whole community. Slagsvold pointed out that crypto does little to help the local community, yet uses tremendous energy. Norway has been an attractive destination for Bitcoin miners because it powers its grid with 92% of its energy from hydropower. Another 7% of energy is powered by wind sources, making the country an incredibly resourceful economy as far as climate targets are concerned. However, this is not enough for the Norwegian government because it is concerned about the long-term viability of crypto mining. Residents of Hadsel, a Norwegian province, petitioned the government in October 2024 to shut down a local Bitcoin mine. Yet, they suffered a rude shock when their electricity prices skyrocketed due to energy companies accounting for lost revenue. Venture capitalists quickly pointed out that residents suffered when the government targeted Bitcoin. However, the mayor of Hadsel, Kjell-Borge Freiberg, said that residents had been complaining about the noise emanating from the Bitcoin mining data centre. The Bitcoin mining operations produced 20% of the energy company’s revenue. When the Bitcoin mine was shut down, the energy company passed on its lost revenue to consumers. It is also possible that the energy company is punishing the residents for disrupting its bottom line. The energy company, however, may lament that one customer could disrupt their business model by shutting down operations. It is estimated that residents of Hadsel, due to the closure of the mine, will pay an extra $235 to $280 on their annual electricity bill. Russia implemented a mining ban on ten regions, including ones that already experienced a vulnerable energy grid. Many countries, such as Norway, are taking a critical stance towards crypto mining, at times for meeting climate targets, while at other times to restrict the spread of anonymous currencies. Energy-rich countries, such as Norway, are budgeting their energy use to prioritise their grid for what they believe are more productive industries. Miners must either remain in the country, invest in low-power consumables, or relocate to another country. There is also the option to switch completely to proof-of-stake methods to appease the Norwegian government and make a profit at the same time. In 2024, Norway first attempted to scrutinize the crypto mining industry by announcing a new set of regulations to shape the market in a way that they felt was appropriate, specifically to adhere to their climate change targets and beliefs about sustainability. The new regulations started this process by requiring all data centres engaged in crypto mining to register their activities. The Norwegian government, however, is adamant that the regulations were not intended to punish the crypto industry but were designed to better align the industry with national targets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/norway-places-temporary-ban-on-crypto-mining-data-centres-to-prioritise-productive-industries/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Norway",cryptocompare

Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a utility-backed cryptocurrency that blends blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) . With its presale already surpassing $1.9 million raised and 160 million tokens sold , analysts predict a staggering 103x ROI during the next bull run, positioning Ruvi AI as a top contender in the crypto market. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart from Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s value stems primarily from its status as a store of value and its limited supply, Ruvi AI offers a range of real-world applications that solve challenges in industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance . By leveraging blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI delivers tools that increase efficiency and scalability, securing demand for its tokens beyond speculation. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s structured growth strategy gives it a clear advantage. During Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at $0.015 each , allowing early adopters an entry point at a fraction of the eventual value. Once the presale concludes, the token price will jump to $0.07 , offering an almost 5x ROI before public trading even begins. Analysts further project that RUVI could climb to $1 post-listing , representing a 103x ROI for presale participants. This clear growth trajectory illustrates Ruvi AI’s potential as a profitable investment compared to Bitcoin’s incremental gains. A Breakthrough Presale The presale phase of Ruvi AI has already demonstrated the project’s strong appeal among investors. The key highlights include: $1.9 million raised Over 160 million tokens sold A supportive base of 1,600+ holders Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI offers a guaranteed $0.07 valuation post-presale , providing an added layer of predictability and security for investors. This transparency has been a significant factor in attracting attention from savvy individuals and whales alike. Unlock More Through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI provides additional incentives through its VIP investment tiers , delivering lucrative bonuses for early participants. Here’s how the tiers break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers make early participation significantly more rewarding, further amplifying potential profits for investors. Security and Transparency Build Credibility Ruvi AI sets itself apart from many other projects by emphasizing transparency and security . The platform is currently undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a respected blockchain security firm. This ensures that Ruvi AI operates on a secure and dependable foundation, which is critical in today’s investment landscape. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a key collaborator that guarantees post-presale liquidity . This ensures that token holders can trade RUVI seamlessly upon its listing, addressing concerns about accessibility and usability. Practical Applications for Sustained Value The real power behind Ruvi AI lies in its real-world utility , which ensures long-term token demand. Here’s how Ruvi AI is revolutionizing key industries: Marketing: AI-powered tools enhance ad targeting, campaign optimization, and ROI, helping businesses thrive in competitive markets. Entertainment: Blockchain-backed payments and AI-recommended content boosts audience engagement and revenue for creators. Finance: Fraud prevention and operational scalability streamline processes for financial institutions, modernizing their systems. These applications make Ruvi AI a practical investment with staying power, distinguishing it from crypto projects that rely heavily on market hype. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Bitcoin While Bitcoin has shown staying power as a digital asset, Ruvi AI’s focus on innovation, utility, and exponential growth potential puts it in a league of its own. With its $0.015 presale price , locked-in $0.07 post-presale valuation , and anticipated $1 post-listing price , Ruvi AI sets the stage for a remarkable 103x ROI .

2025-06-21T22:00:22,"Will ADA and Bitcoin Continue Sideways or Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the One to Watch for 23,800% ROI?","As the summer of 2025 unfolds, two of the market’s largest cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin and Cardano, are struggling to break free from a prolonged sideways trading pattern. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is attracting the attention of traders, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts alike. Notably, market watchers are betting big, predicting bold projections of up to 23,800% return on investment. Bitcoin and Cardano Stuck in the Middle Bitcoin has seen volatility in June, fluctuating between $101,000 and $112,000. After a brief decline to $101,000 amid geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, BTC rebounded above $105,000. However, the broader outlook remains cautious. BTC 1-month price chart- source CoinGecko Analysts have put the limelight on the mounting global uncertainties, including Federal Reserve rate decisions and ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Notably, this has turned BTC into more of a hedge than a growth vehicle. Despite heightened acceptance in corporate institutions, like GameStop’s recent capital allocation to BTC, skepticism remains high. Notably, a drop below the $100K mark could quickly sour sentiment and trigger a wave of sell-offs among risk-averse investors. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, is navigating a different kind of turbulence. As of mid-June, ADA is trading between $0.61 and $0.78, but most recently fell over 6% to around $0.6412 after failing to break key resistance levels at $0.68. Internal governance debates and ongoing ecosystem upgrades are keeping the community engaged, but the upward price momentum has left many retail investors uncertain. While Cardano’s commitment to decentralization, interoperability, and DeFi remains strong, the token’s performance has not been motivating for short-term speculators looking for big gains. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is The Breakout Opportunity of 2025. With the top-tier tokens consolidating, eyes are now turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, an explosive new entry that’s quickly becoming known as the ultimate 2025 investor Pick. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a top analyst’s choice. Market pundits have made projections as high as 23,800% ROI, and the early metrics support this bullish case. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart due to its capped supply model, which introduces built-in scarcity. Additionally, the project has taken a prudent step forward which is highly attractive to long-term investors. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone a full audit by HashEx. The audit revealed no stealth minting features, and no security vulnerabilities, ensuring maximum transparency and investor protection. The excitement around MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by large-scale buyer, strong on-chain engagement, and a surging online community. Early investors are doubling down on the asset. Final Verdict Bitcoin and Cardano are currently facing hurdles. Both cryptocurrencies are struggling with macroeconomic headwinds, including persistent inflation, and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently demonstrating impressive upward momentum.This surge is fueled by a wholesome combination of factors, including robust investor confidence and a compelling growth narrative.

Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on June 21, 2025, creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and making Texas the third U.S. state to do so. Gov. Abbott received SB 21 on June 1, 2025, and had until June 22, 2025, to sign or veto it. Under the Texas Constitution, a bill left unsigned by that date becomes law automatically. With SB 21 now signed, Texas has now become the third state to approve a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after Arizona and New Hampshire. Source: Legiscan.com Under SB 21 , the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage a fund kept outside the state treasury. It will be funded by legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment returns, and voluntary cryptocurrency gifts. The law sets rules on how the comptroller can buy, hold, and sell digital assets. Supporters say it will help guard against inflation, boost the state’s financial strength, and keep Texas ahead in digital asset use. Texas Bitcoin Reserve focuses on stability with market cap threshold The law only lets the fund invest in cryptocurrencies that have had an average market cap of at least $500 billion in the past 12 months. That rule is meant to keep the fund focused on large, stable coins—currently, that is mainly Bitcoin. Since its first draft, SB 21 was revised in the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency. The most recent version adds clearer guidelines, new risk controls, and limits the comptroller’s power over speculative spending of public money. Earlier, Texas also approved House Bill 4488. That law prevents any funds set aside for a future Bitcoin reserve from being swept into the general revenue fund. It created the legal basis for holding digital assets under state law. While HB 4488 protects the reserve funds, SB 21 is the law that actually lets the state create the reserve. It allows the comptroller to use surplus general revenue to buy digital assets with a market value of at least $600 billion, a threshold met only by Bitcoin today.

He argues that relying on a fiat currency he views as shaky makes little sense when a more stable asset exists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight His comments have reignited a long‑running debate about what should sit behind digital coins that promise a steady peg. Schiff Questions Fiat Backing According to Schiff, it makes no sense to support a token pegged to a currency that can be inflated away. “I get Bitcoin, but not US dollar stablecoins,” he wrote in a social media post. He pointed out that fiat money can be printed in large amounts, while gold has a fixed supply and centuries of use as money. Schiff said gold cannot be easily devalued by inflation or reckless monetary policies. I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins. If you’re going to introduce a third party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 19, 2025 Gold‑Backed Tokens On The Rise Based on reports, gold‑backed stablecoins are seeing more interest from investors worried about inflation and dollar weakness. Tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG) let users move digital claims on physical gold. These assets give the same quick transfers and high liquidity as dollar‑pegged coins but tie each token to real metal stored in vaults. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies Regulators across the globe are racing to establish precise regulations for stablecoin reserves. Congress members in the US are considering tighter reserve and audit requirements. Europe and Asia are creating their own regulations to achieve transparency and safeguard users. Schiff’s call for gold introduces additional context to these discussions. It could lead regulators to explore whether commodities can serve as backing for tokens under particular regimes. Market Reaction Mixed According to reports, Schiff’s tweet trended, garnering over 500,000 views within 24 hours. Crypto naysayers applauded his observation on fiat risk. Other investors cautioned that gold-backed tokens have higher fees and cumbersome custody expenses. They explained that transferring metal or establishing physical reserves introduces friction when compared with exchanging dollar-backed coins at a bank custodian. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Investors also pointed out that stablecoins are widely used in lending, trading and payments within DeFi platforms.

He’s just stupid.” This statement clearly shows the extent to which the conflict over monetary policy has reached in US politics. Trump defends his low interest rate policy in terms of both economic recovery and public debt remaining manageable. However, Powell is determined to keep interest rates high to combat inflation. With the decision announced last night, the FED kept the interest rate steady at 4.5%, making it the fifth interest rate decision to remain unchanged since December 2024. The most important issue that Simean Koch underlines in his analysis is that the US economy is facing the risk of stagflation. Stagflation is a scenario in which economic stagnation, high inflation and unemployment occur simultaneously. In such an environment, the FED's field of action is quite limited: While interest rate hikes increase unemployment, interest rate cuts can fuel inflation. While Trump advocates for the Fed to cut interest rates faster, citing the Eurozone as an example, Powell is resisting this pressure. The Eurozone has cut interest rates from 4.5% to 2.15% since last year, while the US has only been able to cut interest rates from 5.5% to 4.5%. The high interest rate environment poses a major threat to cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. Historical data shows that altcoin bull seasons often coincide with low interest rates. Interest rates were also relatively low during the 2017 and 2021 upswings. However, interest rates are currently higher than even those periods. In addition, the FED's balance sheet reduction program (quantitative tightening) continues. In other words, liquidity in the market is shrinking. In this environment, it becomes difficult for altcoins to rise. According to Powell, the FED's transition to balance sheet expansion is only possible if interest rates drop to zero, which could come to the agenda in 2028 at the earliest according to the FED's projection. Related News: The Macroeconomic Outlook for the New Week Has Been Released - Here's What to Watch for in This Critical Week Another important point that Koch drew attention to is the withdrawal of small investors from the market. While the number of individual investors has decreased since the summer, institutional investors (such as MicroStrategy or Bitcoin ETFs) continue to accumulate Bitcoin. This creates a serious problem, especially for small altcoin projects, because their prices are largely dependent on individual investor interest. In addition, conflicts in the Middle East, rising oil prices, and tensions in US domestic politics (between Trump and Powell) negatively affect market confidence, which further reduces demand for altcoins. Despite such a negative picture, Simean Koch does not think that the altcoin season is completely over. Historically, individual investors first withdraw from the market, then Bitcoin rises, and in the final stage, altcoin seasons begin. This scenario was repeated in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. Therefore, according to Koch, despite the current pressures, it is still possible for an altcoin season to begin. However, for this to happen, the Fed must cut interest rates and ease monetary policy. Although it seems unlikely that this will happen anytime soon, it is too early to completely write off altcoins in this cycle. *This is not investment advice.

It will cross the $10 mark in 2027 and the $20 mark in 2029. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask.

Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram, is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000?

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Kaleo, tells his 704,200 followers on the social media platform X that in 2020, Bitcoin sparked parabolic rallies to new all-time highs after the stock market had fully recovered from the COVID-19 crash and broke out to new record highs. According to Kaleo, the S&P 500 stock index is “once again on the verge of breaking out to new all-time highs” following the correction that resulted from the imposition of tariffs on trade partners by the US. “I believe we see history repeat itself, and as equities break out – Bitcoin does the same and significantly outperforms.” Source: Kaleo/X As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,967 points, down by just about 3% from its record high of 6,147 points. The pseudonymous analyst further says that, unlike in the previous cycles, Bitcoin is now attracting new sources of demand. According to Kaleo, this is a reason to “be more bullish” on the flagship crypto asset. “This is the first cycle with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Something we dreamed of in previous cycles, but never saw come to fruition. This allows potential investment of new capital into BTC at a rate we’ve never seen before. Countries and corporations are starting to build BTC reserves. El Salvador, Tesla, Gamestop, and others are only the first dominoes to fall. We finally have a pro-crypto president in the US pushing for pro-industry regulation. The tech and infrastructure of the industry is also better than it’s ever been. [Decentralized Applications] DApps are more advanced, BTC is being used as a development layer, and the number of places that accept BTC as a form of payment is higher than it’s ever been before.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,143 at time of writing, down by around 7% from the all-time high reached last month.

The accused pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges tied to a $245M Bitcoin theft from a Genesis creditor in August of the same year. Chetal was charged in November 2024, pleaded guilty, and even promised to testify against his co-defendants; that was why he was released on bond. The courts expected Chetal to clean up his act after the run-in with the law, but he had other plans. Update: Wiz (Veer Chetal) was arrested by US Marshall’s and here is his mug shot. pic.twitter.com/O25UU25VhR — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) March 25, 2025 Chetal stole again while he was released on bond Details of Chetal’s legal proceedings were revealed to the public last week, when a federal district judge in Washington ordered the documents unsealed. As earlier stated, he was released on bond. However, he was re-arrested in late January 2025 after federal authorities found out Chetal was involved in additional crimes, including 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024. Among his additional crimes is a $2 million social engineering theft that involved Chetal while he was released on October 21, 2024. The crime targeted a New Jersey resident, convincing her that she was speaking to a Gemini exchange support member before getting her to turn over the seed phrase to her crypto wallet. Blockchain tracing traced the funds to an online gambling account and to the exchange eXch, a non-KYC exchange preferred by illicit actors. Chetal may have gotten away with the act if the VPN he allegedly used to access the account, where $200,000 worth of the stolen funds wound up, had not failed briefly. According to investigators, “on one of the six occasions, within 40 minutes of account opening and 30 minutes of receiving the stolen funds, the account VPN network ‘failed’ and the true IP address leaked.” The IP was traced to Chetal’s mother, and phone records acquired from T-Mobile put him at the scene. However, Wiz didn’t hold on to the funds for long. “Chetal admits that, even after he began negotiating with the Government, he secured $200,000 in illicit funds with a simple text message,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who denied Chetal’s request to be re-released on bond, wrote. “That sum was so trivial to Chetal that he gambled and lost all $200,000 on a single bet nine minutes later.” As it stands, Chetal is deemed a flight risk, especially given his lack of U.S. citizenship and his desire to travel abroad. Defense filings show he booked an Indian university entrance exam and inquired about colleges in Dubai after he had pled guilty. How Chetal’s activities almost cost him his parents Shortly after the original $245 million theft, a group of six men targeted Chetal’s parents in a kidnapping attempt. However, they were thwarted by Danbury police officers, who arrested the suspects and rescued Wiz’s parents, who were bound and injured. 1/ An investigation into how Greavys (Malone Iam), Wiz (Veer Chetal), and Box (Jeandiel Serrano) stole $243M from a single person last month in a highly sophisticated social engineering attack and my efforts which have helped lead to multiple arrests and millions frozen. pic.twitter.com/dcY1e9xsPd — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 19, 2024 Chetal’s father reportedly came away from the ordeal with severe facial and arm injuries, and he reportedly lost his job at Morgan Stanley in the wake of the incident. The man behind the plot has been identified as James Schwab, 22, of Georgia, and while he was not present at the scene, it has been confirmed that he orchestrated the plot from afar. “Schwab, who had an altercation with the victims’ son in a Miami nightclub in July 2024, was in regular communication with certain of the kidnappers in the days before the crime, provided funding for it, and helped arrange the participants’ transportation and lodging,” a DoJ press release said. Schwab pleaded not guilty, but five of the six kidnappers he hired have pleaded guilty, according to the press release. One of the kidnapping suspects, Anthony Pena, has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and kidnapping charges. The four other suspects who pleaded guilty are yet to be sentenced, while the only one holding out, Reynaldo Diaz, will appear in court for a trial in late September.

2025-06-21T19:05:00,"Celestia price prediction 2025-2031: Will TIA lead the altcoin rally in 2025?","Key Takeaways : The Celestia price prediction for 2025 suggests a maximum price of $21.22. By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $1.55 (-1.6%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $1.62 24-hour low $1.53 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $1.55 Price Prediction $1.51 (-25.24%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Price Volatility 13.57% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $2.65 200-Day SMA $3.82 14-Day RSI 36.61 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a bearish pressure toward $1.55 TIA price analysis shows bearish volatility toward $1.55 Resistance for TIA is present at $2.294 Support for TIA/USD is present at $1.478 The TIA price analysis for June 21 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward $1.55 level. Currently, bears are dominating the price chart around support lines. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price struggles in gaining buying confidence Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising bearish threat momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $1.55. The higher highs triggered significant selloff, resulting in a drop below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged to $9.02 million, showing a slight increase in trading activity today.

TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $2 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.478, resulting in a correction to $1.030. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price attempted to hold above $2 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers’ failure triggered a bearish rally toward $1.5. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction June 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction June 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction 2025 1.5 18.47 21.22 Celestia price prediction 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2026 25.58 26.32 30.48 2027 36.19 37.51 44.06 2028 54.61 56.11 64.46 2029 77.94 80.75 94.14 2030 111.83 115.06 138.32 2031 135.87 140.58 156.88 Celestia price prediction for 2026 Notably, some early investors’ vested tokens will become available before and during this period.

2025-06-21T19:01:07,"Crypto Millionaire Raoul Pal Predicts How Long the Bull Market Will Continue in Bitcoin","Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal pointed out that cryptocurrency markets are currently repeating the cycle from 2017. Pal said that a similar scenario is currently playing out, recalling that in 2017, Bitcoin showed a steady rise throughout the year and gained sharply in value in December. Based on macroeconomic indicators, he noted that the current crypto bull cycle could last until the second quarter of 2026. Pal gave important signals for investors in his conversation with Jamie Coutts, director of crypto analysis, on the “The Journeyman” program broadcast on Real Vision. “When liquidity increases, the crypto market grows, this is now a clear relationship,” said Pal, arguing that Bitcoin’s sensitivity to global liquidity increased in certain periods by analyzing past data. Coutts spoke about the new analysis models they have developed recently. These models include structures that relate Bitcoin's price movements to the increase in global liquidity and also measure risk levels in the markets. Coutts stated that investors should pay attention not only to price estimates, but also to market behavior and leverage ratios. Related News: Ethereum's Major Developers Meeting Has Ended - Critical Date Announced Underlining developments in the Middle East in particular, Pal said that countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar are making major investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies. According to Pal, these countries are not only holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but are also building their state infrastructure on blockchain. It is stated that systems are being developed where transactions such as driver's licenses and land records will be managed with blockchain. Raoul Pal said that these large-scale investments and institutional adoption are not only fueling the bull market, but also accelerating the adoption of crypto as infrastructure. “This is no longer just a speculative asset class; the foundational layers of the new internet are being built,” he said. According to Pal’s analysis, in light of liquidity conditions and macro indicators such as the dollar index, this bull cycle is likely to continue until the second quarter of 2026. “The current cycle resembles 2017 more than 2021. This long-term cycle may be larger and more complex than previously expected,” he commented. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-21T18:45:30,"Traders Should Pay Attention to This Benchmark Amid Ongoing Macroeconomic Uncertainty, Says Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio","Billionaire Ray Dalio says that investors should keep an eye on one benchmark indicator amid macroeconomic uncertainty. In a new thread on the social media platform X, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio says if the Federal Reserve were to cut interest rates too much, it could lead to further economic hardships, and that traders should monitor the Fed’s yield curve. According to Dalio, a combination of long rates rising, the dollar dipping in value and an uptick in gold could spell trouble. “The Fed is in a very difficult position as it tries to balance the benefits of cutting interest rates with maintaining the value of money. Right now, there is a great deal of uncertainty throughout the economy, along with a deterioration in sentiment. Combine that with political pressures and the realities of our upcoming debt service payments, and you have this value of money conflict. So changes in the monetary policy – especially if the cut is too aggressive – could lead to a period of great concern. My advice: Watch the yield curve. If you see long rates rising alongside downward movement in the dollar and rises in gold, you’ll know there’s a movement out of bonds. Because the value of money matters a lot.” The yield curve is a graph that shows the interest rates (yields) of US Treasury securities across different maturities, from short-term bills to long-term bonds. It reflects market expectations about future interest rates and economic conditions, and is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve and market participants. Earlier this week, Dalio warned against trading the most popular meme stocks as they are bound to fizzle out. “These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don’t take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don’t pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T18:30:29,"Bitcoin Active Addresses At 2020 Level — What’s Happening?","The Bitcoin price action in June has displayed healthy swings from a low of about $100,500 to as high as $111,000. While it has lacked the impulsive momentum seen in past cycles for more bullish swings, the premier cryptocurrency has managed to maintain its valuation above $100,000. Over the past week, BTC has displayed relative price stability, with modest bullish movement at intervals. The cryptocurrency continued to trade within a tight range for most of the week, mirroring a mix of optimism and caution amongst market participants. Active Addresses Mirror 2020 Levels In a June 20 post on social media platform X, on-chain analytics firm Alphractal published its recent findings on the Bitcoin active addresses, revealing that the flagship cryptocurrency does not show an indication of market euphoria. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bottoms Out? Recovery Hopes Rise After Base Formation The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Active Addresses metric, which measures the number of unique addresses that are active on the Bitcoin network within a specific timeframe. To be clear, an address is “active” if it is receiving and sending Bitcoin during a particular period. The chart shared by Alphractal shows that active addresses are at the same level as in 2020. The analytics firm pointed out that as of 2020, the market was facing political uncertainty, dealing with a global pandemic, and widespread social fear, as the effects on market engagement are what is currently being witnessed. In the post on X, Alphractal highlighted two possible reasons for this seeming lack of enthusiasm seen in investors. Firstly, the market intelligence firm noted that investors might have become disillusioned with all that is currently happening in the crypto market, regardless of Bitcoin’s value comfortably being above $100,000. On the other hand, Alphractal put forward the possibility that this relative inactivity could be a result of a strong long-term conviction in the flagship cryptocurrency as a store of value. However, this second reasoning was immediately put down by Alphractal as readings from two other indicators — the on-chain volume and spot volume — are both low, indicating little global interest in the cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin still prevails above $100,000, this could be a strong indication, Alphractal explained, “that only the most resilient are taking advantage of the long-awaited $100k per BTC.” Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $103,290, reflecting an over 1% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of BTC has fallen by about 2.4% in value over the past seven days.

With markets weathering geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks in recent weeks, the coming “quadruple witching” could test altcoin stability—but if Bitcoin ( BTC ) stays above key support at $104,000, SEI and KAIA may have room to run. Table of Contents SEI and KAIA price analysis Market volatility in response to quadruple witching Trump-era optimism SEI and KAIA price analysis SEI traded at $0.1948 early on Friday, with modest gains. The token added 6% to its value in the past seven days, as seen on TradingView . SEI’s closest support and resistance levels are S1 at $0.1582, the June 17 low and R1 at $0.2494, the upper boundary of an FVG on the daily price chart. Technical indicators RSI and MACD support a bullish thesis. RSI reads 50 and is sloping upwards. MACD shows underlying positive momentum in SEI price trend on the daily timeframe. SEI could see a daily candlestick close above R1 and test resistance at $0.2750, the May 11 peak for the token. SEI/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Conversely, higher volatility could usher a correction in SEI, sending the token to collect liquidity at $0.1303 support, as seen in the SEI/USDT price chart. KAIA hovers above the $0.19 level on Friday. The token posted over 2% gains and extended its value on Friday. KAIA has observed nearly 9% increase in its value in the past seven days. The KAIA/USDT daily price chart shows strong potential for further increase in the token’s price. RSI signals the token is currently overvalued, however until it dips under the 70 level, it does not typically generate a sell signal. MACD flashes increasingly taller green histogram bars, meaning there is an underlying positive trend in KAIA price. The closest resistance is R1 at $0.2054, the upper boundary of the FVG on the daily price chart. Next hurdle on the path to re-test 2025 peak at $0.2665 is R2 at $0.2525. KAIA/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Conversely, KAIA could sweep liquidity at the February 3 low of $0.08. Another key support is the lower boundary of the FVG at $0.1077. You might also like: Here’s why the Kaia price has gone parabolic Market volatility in response to quadruple witching Crypto market capitalization is down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. The quadruple witching event has traders on edge, expecting higher volatility and price swings in Bitcoin and altcoin prices. Volatility may have subsided for now, with most altcoins ending the week in green, geopolitical tensions over the weekend could impact liquidity and trader sentiment. Traders have previously remained neutral, and crypto prices have shown resilience in the face of tariff uncertainty, wars, and missiles. However, it remains to be seen how the market will react to short-lived volatility this weekend. Traders remained neutral on Friday, sentiment reads 54 on a scale of 0 to 100, suggesting a neutral outlook towards the market. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative You might also like: Best crypto to buy ahead of Friday’s $6.5b triple witching Trump-era optimism The optimism that Trump ushered in with his election victory and Bitcoin’s new all-time high could keep altcoins afloat during times of uncertainty. Even as traders turn risk-averse, Bitcoin price defended the $100,000 milestone and failed to sweep under the level even in the face of escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. In short, macroeconomic headwinds have failed to shake the resolve of crypto traders, perhaps due to the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Senate, the resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, and the SEC’s leniency toward the crypto sector. Altcoin market capitalization is testing key support at $1.09 trillion. If prices remain relatively stable and traders defend the support, altcoins like SEI and KAIA could survive the short-lived market volatility without erasing prior gains.

2025-06-21T18:13:08,"Czech Government Survives No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Donation","The Czech government has weathered a political storm this week, surviving a no-confidence vote triggered by a $45 million bitcoin payment from a convicted criminal. The scandal has rocked Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s administration months before national elections, Reuters reports . The payment of 468 bitcoin was made to the state by a man previously jailed for running a darknet drug marketplace called Sheep Marketplace. The donation was accepted by then-Justice Minister Pavel Blazek, who later resigned amid the backlash , on behalf of the government. The bitcoin was sold for roughly 1 billion Czech koruna, worth around $45 million. Opposition party ANO, which leads polls ahead of the October vote, filed a no-confidence motion and accused the ruling coalition of potentially aiding in the laundering of illicit assets, as the source of the BTC is unclear. Critics say the government should have involved prosecutors or police instead of accepting potentially tainted crypto funds. After two days of debate, the motion failed in the lower house, where Fiala's coalition retains a majority. Still, Blazek insisted he acted legally in accepting the donation, which amounted to about 30% of crypto found on the man's returned devices. The donor’s motives remain unclear. The case shook the government of a country whose central bank earlier this year approved a proposal to study bitcoin as a reserve asset. Czech National Bank chief Ales Michl has even said bitcoin is not to be “lumped together” with crypto. Polymarket traders are currently seeing the main opposition party, ANO, win the parliamentary election in October. Perceived odds of that outcome are currently at 92% , while Blazek’s ODS party’s chances stand at just 6%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/21/czech-government-survives-no-confidence-vote-over-45m-bitcoin-donation,"BTC|FIAT","Finance|Czech Republic|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

The OCC says it’s issuing an order of prohibition against William Shane Garrow, the former senior vice president of private banking for a subsidiary of BOK Financial in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Says the OCC, “Between approximately March 17, 2021 and March 12, 2024, respondent misappropriated approximately $3,437,536 from multiple customers’ accounts under the bank’s custody for his personal benefit, without the customers’ knowledge or authorization.” According to the OCC, Garrow engaged in unsafe and unsound practices and violations of law that resulted in significant losses for the bank. The regulator has now banned Garrow from working at insured depository institutions, including banks and credit unions. The former bank executive is consenting to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the OCC’s findings. The OCC action comes after Garrow pleaded guilty to bank fraud and willfully making and subscribing a false Federal income tax return. Garrow was sentenced last month to 71 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay $3.86 million in restitution and $1.519 million to the IRS. Prosecutors said Garrow directed fraudulent wire transfers and cashier’s checks from at least 16 client accounts to entities and bank accounts that he controlled. If a client asked about the transactions, Garrow blamed it on a banking error and would return the funds stolen or transfer money from another victim’s account. Said US Attorney Clint Johnson last month, “Garrow deceived people for over 12 years, and his actions wreaked havoc on banking personnel who were tasked with correcting his wrongs. This was not a simple banking error or an accident, but rather a criminal scheme. Garrow abused the trust given to him by the bank and its customers.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
