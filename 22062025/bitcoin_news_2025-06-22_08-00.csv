Experts Warn of a Possible $1.55 Test appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP is showing signs of weakness despite recently climbing above a descending trendline that had capped every rally since February. After slipping back under key resistance levels, analysts now warn that XRP could be at risk of a deeper pullback in the coming sessions. At the time of writing, XRP is struggling to hold support around $2.10, having dipped as low as $2.03. Analyst CasiTrades warns that while XRP briefly reclaimed its breakout level, the move could be a false breakout. She added that if open interest begins to rise without a meaningful price move, particularly if it crosses 0.02% or higher — it could signal a high probability of a liquidity sweep to the downside. “If we fail to hold $2.25, it puts $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55 in play,” she explained. A capitulation move toward these lower levels, while painful in the short term, could generate the exact momentum XRP needs to finally break free of its multi-year range. CasiTrades said such a shakeout could pave the way for a powerful Wave 3 breakout in the coming weeks. Technical indicators support the bearish short-term outlook. RSI and Stochastic indicators on the daily and 4-hour charts are showing oversold conditions, hinting at continued selling pressure before a possible rebound. The market is currently watching the $1.95–$1.88 zone closely for signs of stabilization. Adding to the uncertainty, XRP’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. As both major cryptocurrencies trade within tight ranges and show signs of a potential pullback, altcoins like XRP are likely to mirror this behavior. While short-term risks remain high, some analysts remain positive about XRP’s medium-term prospects. If the market can shake off current bearish sentiment, XRP could recover towards $2.25–$2.35 initially, with more ambitious targets of $3 by the end of July if bullish momentum builds.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-crash-25-experts-warn-of-a-possible-1-55-test/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

At press time, shares of the Yes side of the Polymarket-listed contract ""Will Iran Close the Strait of Hormuz before June 30 traded at 40 cents, representing a 40% probability. That's a notable increase from 14% Saturday. Meanwhile, the odds of the event occurring by the end of the year increased to 52%, up from 33% the previous day. Approximately 20 million barrels of oil are transported through the Strait of Hormuz daily, accounting for around 20% of the world's oil consumption, according to the Middle East Forum Observer . Therefore, the potential closure of the Hormuz could trigger a sustained oil price shock. According to JPMorgan's analysts , shutting the Strait of Hormuz could catapult crude oil prices to an eye-popping $120 to $130 per barrel. Such a spike in oil prices, coupled with the ongoing trade war, could lead to stagflation – the worst outcome for financial assets, including cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-22T04:44:48,"Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will hit $21M by 2046","Strategy founder Michael Saylor predicts that Bitcoin will hit $21 million in the next 21 years. In a Saturday X post , he commented, “$21 million in 21 years.” However, he noted that getting to $21 million per BTC may be fraught with significant price swings given the token’s high volatility. Saylor says the recent geopolitical and regulatory developments influenced his BTC expectations In his previous statements, he argued on the significance of the number “21,” noting its connection to Bitcoin’s total supply and now its projected $21 million price point. He strongly believes the asset will reach his target by 2046. Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 event on Saturday, he affirmed that this could be the one time in Bitcoin’s timeline when a 21-year outlook aligns with a $21 million valuation. His new projection is a significant step-up from his previous prediction at the 2024 Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where he stated Bitcoin would reach $13 million by 2045 . He asserted that his heightened bullish outlook on Bitcoin was shaped by recent developments in geopolitics, regulation, and adoption—none of which, he noted, were anticipated a year ago. Saylor claimed he did not expect the White House to embrace and advocate for Bitcoin, acknowledging that Donald Trump’s presidential victory marked a huge political turning point last November. He pointed out that while there was optimism about having a pro-Bitcoin leader, they did not think they would get a strategic BTC reserve, or a President who’s set to make the country the Bitcoin superpower of the world. He also touched on the new regulatory and legislative developments around crypto, including the stablecoin-focused Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act, adding that no one could have guessed that states would embrace BTC. While he remains bullish that BTC will soon reach $21 million, he also predicts a volatile ride for the token. He, however, forecasts the fluctuations to eventually level out, projecting a solid 21% CAGR over time. He added that the token could very well continue to surpass the S&P 500 each year till 2046. Saylor has never disclosed where Strategy’s BTC holdings are Aside from Saylor’s bullish prediction, his company, Strategy, has maintained its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, adding another $1 billion in BTC last week. The company held about 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025, but it has not disclosed how and where it stores its holdings. Saylor was very vocal about his disapproval of the concept of proof-of-reserves. Speaking at the May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, he argued that PoR dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. Last year, Saylor also rejected the concept of self-custody, contradicting many Bitcoin holders. After receiving much criticism from the crypto community for encouraging the use of banks rather than self-custody, he shifted to voicing support for the method for individuals who are “willing and able.” At the BTC Prague event, many attendees seemed drawn to the idea of self-custody, citing “be your own bank” principles. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at the hardware wallet company, Trezor, even confirmed that the event attendees included “a vibrant mix of developers, Bitcoiners, and newcomers — all genuinely interested in open-source tools and the principles of self-custody.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-22T03:22:07,"BNB Chain Weathers Turbulent Week Amid Altcoin Meltdown","The BNB Chain ecosystem has endured a stormy week, shedding $12.4 billion in market capitalization amid a broader altcoin crash that rippled across the digital asset space. While flagship assets such as Bitcoin slipped below the $104,000 mark, the BNB Chain’s performance mirrored the market downturn with a 7% drop in value. BNB itself fell 4.5%, closing the week just under $640. On-chain diagnosis of the state of affairs was not encouraging. Total value locked (TVL) in the BNB Chain ecosystem took a 5% hit. The major DeFi platforms—which include Venus and PancakeSwap—suffered big losses. The situation was not helped by falling trading volumes on DeFi exchanges and across the board; stablecoin transactions, which had been a bright spot, also declined. Overall, there has been a notable drop in engagement on-chain and in movement of capital across the BNB Chain. It is interesting to note that the daily active addresses on BNB Chain increased by 5%. This percentage increase suggests that despite the selloff, and reduced trading activity, users of BNB Chain are continuing to interact with applications on that network. In fact, this uptick in user activity, even with the market heading downward, says a lot about BNB Chain—and not just in terms of its solvency. Tokens Tumble, But Some Defy Gravity The week saw severe losses for most BEP-20 tokens on the BNB Chain. Among them, KOGE took one of the sharpest falls, plummeting down to 51.1%. ROAM wasn’t too far behind, with a decline of 40.4%; MYTH, with 38.2% down, closely followed. These altcoin losses are a function of the segment’s overall volatility and risk sensitivity. Investors seem to be pulling capital from the smaller, emerging tokens that for them provide little cover in the face of a dip like this. Altcoins can be more easily and dramatically affected by market movement because they are either illiquid or insufficiently capitalized. Altcoins are also the tokens most likely to get the rug pulled on them. A handful of tokens managed to log some gains, even with the market feeling negative. AB surged 31.5% because of something we don’t usually get a chance to talk about, the kind of increased visibility that comes with being featured on Binance Alpha. ALT logged a nice 23.9% bump, thanks to its new role in the BNB Kickstart program, which aims to help serve and shine a light on new projects in the crypto space that really seem to have something special going on. ORBS was another token that took the opportunity of this clearly defined market to power up a 15.5% gain. And standing out was clearly the way to go, as that was the only way to be noticed in a mostly negative space. These tokens’ performance demonstrates that, although the broader market was facing difficulty, some projects were still managing to preserve or even enhance their value. The kinds of projects that thrived in this context seemed to have either institutional or programmatic backing. Week in BNB Chain: Sector Weakens During Altcoin Market Meltdown. BNB Chain sheds $12.4B! BTC drops Let’s break down how BNB Chain weathered the storm 1/6 pic.twitter.com/9Tjmn0azSj — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 19, 2025 Ecosystem Developments Point to Long-Term Growth In the middle of market ups and downs, the BNB Chain kept its eyes on the prize: the expansion and betterment of its ecosystem. Last week, the BNB Chain Incentive Fund, worth $100 million, made 17 fresh token buys, still on that same mission to help pay for the sort of innovation that will, ideally, also pay off in the sort of growth that we hope accompanies the kinds of not-so-promising projects we find on some networks. One significant change occurred when the complete migration of KOM from Polygon and Arbitrum to the BNB Chain was realized. This represented not just an appeasement of KOM to a new ecosystem, but a corroboration from developers of the BNB Chain’s infrastructure, scalability, and support systems. It could be that projects migrating are finding new advantages in the environments they are moving to. Then again, it could be that BNB Chain is simply the next place to be for projects looking to establish a strong community. Migration seems to be the word of the day. At the same time, MCPForge experienced an enhancement in its designation within the BNB Hack program, which underscores the ecosystem’s excitement about rewarding and recognizing technical brilliance. Also, SwissBorg implemented BNB Chain into its cross-chain functionality, allowing smooth token swapping between various blockchain networks and further interpolating BNB Chain into the global crypto scene. These initiatives in the ecosystem signal to us that BNB Chain is not standing idle in the current climate of market pressure. It is purposeful. It is investing. And not just in what it already has. It is expanding its very nascent infrastructure (it must be real if it’s called the ‘infrastructure fund’), growing the developer ecosystem with the recent hackathon, and also—this is key—we mustn’t skip over—it is deepening and widening its cross-chain work nowadays. Looking Ahead Even with BNB Chain losing billions in value alongside the broader altcoin market, the network sees very encouraging user activity as well as strategic and smart growth around its ecosystem that makes it look like it has some underlying strength. And you know, I think it’d be good to put a bit of context around BNB Chain here too, since it is a bit of a tricky case for certain folks. So, first, the user base: it puts BNB Chain at almost over 200 million users across its ecosystem. While the crypto markets keep moving up and down, the long-term strength of chains such as BNB may depend on how well they can keep user engagement and draw in novel projects. BNB Chain showed signs this past week that it might be doing a good job on both fronts. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-22T03:19:17,"Tensions Rise Between Trump and Powell as Markets Await Interest Rate Cuts","The U.S . monetary policy is now under some very vocal pressures. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the way monetary policy is now being conducted, and in no uncertain terms told his followers on Truth Social that Powell is a “disaster” and that “inflation is going to kill our economy”—and that he’s disappointed they’re now holding rates steady and not cutting them like he apparently thinks they should. What are the potential impacts of all this on not just the stock market but also cryptocurrencies and the wider economy? At the center of the controversy is the well-known clash of interests: Trump’s aggressive preference for rate cuts to juice the economy versus Powell’s umpteenth reiteration of the Fed’s dual mandate—ensure stable prices and maximum employment. With the electoral drama of 2024 out of the way, we’re likely to be in a more volatile 2025 financial landscape. The priorities of elected officials and those of the independent central bank will likely be more at odds than ever—and likely a much bigger story than Trump still being very much in the picture. More Publicly Traded Companies Now Hold BTC In the first half of 2025, the number of publicly traded companies holding #Bitcoin has tripled compared to 2024. This surge is driven by increasingly crypto-friendly regulations in the U.S., which are encouraging corporate adoption of… pic.twitter.com/961ai5gLtP — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 19, 2025 Market Correction Highlights Growing Pressure The ongoing rate stalemate has evoked a cautious retreat in the markets. As of now, Bitcoin trades at a distance of 6.8% from its all-time high of $64,000 reached on May 22, 2021. Similarly, the S&P 500 stands at a 2.6% deficit from its record peak of $3,386 reached on February 19, 2021. These figures represent a modest downward correction for both assets, but they shine a light on the current state of investor confidence in both the Fed’s next move and the broader macroeconomic recovery. With Trump expressing his disappointment in Jerome Powell & the FOMC leaving interest rates unchanged, social media has erupted with discussions. Crypto, like global stock markets, stand to benefit if and when rate cuts happen again. Currently, Bitcoin is -6.8% below its… pic.twitter.com/PTM1nAVx1W — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 In the past, lower interest rates have benefitted stocks and crypto assets because they mean cheaper borrowing costs, which translates into greater liquidity and risk appetite. Some traders and analysts see the potential for rate cuts as a bullish catalyst across the board. But rate cuts could be an even better catalyst for crypto, given that the market’s tendency to respond sharply to shifts in monetary policy. Trump sees a link between his popularity and the Fed’s interest rate policies. When consumers and businesses are confident, the economy hums along. When that happens, the president tends to look good, at least if he’s up for re-election the next year. But Powell has so far resisted this pressure, maintaining that any future rate moves will be guided by economic data—particularly inflation indicators—rather than political will. This confrontation lays the groundwork for a strained standoff between the president and the Fed, with ripple effects almost sure to be felt in global markets. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings See Massive Growth Though rate policy usually gets the most attention, a much quieter but equally significant transformation is taking place within the crypto universe. The number of publicly traded firms that now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets has tripled, from 10 to 30, over the last year. Why are so many more companies now jumping into the deep end of crypto, and what does it mean for the future? More favorable regulation in the U.S. has set the stage for greater corporate adoption of crypto. Moves in Congress lately have clarified how crypto is taxed, set up some investor protections, and basically streamlined the regulatory environment for crypto, which makes it a whole lot easier for companies to hold and manage Bitcoin. Next, rising geopolitical instability—from trade confrontations to shooting wars—has renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a bulwark against uncertainty. Increasingly, many companies view BTC not just as a bet-it-all-in Vegas kind of play but instead as something more analogous to a strategic reserve that also happens to be digital gold. In times of market turbulence or currency convulsions, Bitcoin’s decentralization and global appeal have never looked more attractive to company treasurers looking for more ways to diversify. Significantly, well-known companies in various fields—including technology, energy, and finance—have jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon, which suggests that the cryptocurrency’s standing in the corporate world is improving. No longer considered a fringe experiment, Bitcoin is now part of the fundamental corporate strategy in many high-profile companies. Policy Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Sentiment The Trump administration and the Federal Reserve are creating a crypto narrative. We have a possible short-term upside event for not just Bitcoin but for all digital assets, which is that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Lowering rates would be bad for the dollar. But it might not even be that bad for the dollar, because it would be lowering the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t pay interest, like Bitcoin. So it’s possible that if the Fed cuts rates, and in the context of broader questions about the federal government’s fiscal policy, we could see the dollar weaken, and that is going to be good for all these assets. Powell and Trump’s stimulus vision in a push-pull market. Powell insists on making data-driven decisions. Trump, on the other hand, pushes for a very proactive kind of stimulus. You have market actors trying to make sense of this and price it in. And they’re having a hell of a time doing it. Why? Because what we’re talking about here is the inner dynamics of inflation. At the same time, the increasingly broad institutional acceptance of Bitcoin provides another fresh layer of support for the cryptocurrency market. That could help soften any downward momentum that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have during poor macroeconomic conditions. And it reinforces the notion that those cryptocurrencies could indeed be viable long-term investments. Once we reach the midpoint of 2025, the Fed’s next move will be the focus of attention, what with a presidential election having just taken place. And right now, we can only guess how the political-economic tug-of-war that is shaping the U.S. Congress might affect the future of both traditional markets and digital assets.

The entire wallet activity across the Bitcoin system seems to tell a story of very divergence accumulation behavior between the types of investors. On one side, we have the big institutional investors, who look to be quietly accumulating even more Bitcoin. And on the other side, we have some retail investors—well, a seemingly shrinking group of them—who look to be bailing out of the system once and for all. Whales Accumulate While Retail Flees A recent influx of blockchain data paints an increasingly clear picture of a market dynamic in flux.

This reflects increasing hesitance or submission to the market among the smaller holder demographic, a phenomenon we often associate with fear or uncertainty when the market is not trending positively. This type of divergence has frequently come before bullish market reversals. When the small fish leave while the big fish are busy gathering more and more shares, that can signal a phase of stealth accumulation that soon flips into an uptrend. The current market cycle has large holders accumulating while the small fry exit. Open Interest Points to Potential Volatility Although wallet activity provides some insight into how investors feel about a project, data from the derivatives market adds a whole other dimension to the analysis—especially open interest, the total value of active futures contracts that investors have with one another. As of now, the change in open interest measures -3.5%. This slight figure in the outflow of leveraged positions shows investors still have some faith in the current Bitcoin price level. This is because a number of traders are written off as de-risking or taking profits when we see drawdowns like this happening with the open interest. It could also be seen as traders taking a little Bitcoin off the exchange and putting it back in cold storage. GM. In 2024–2025, deep open interest drawdowns –20–25% were accompanied by local BTC price corrections in the range of 7–21%. Currently, the OI change is –3.5%, which indicates a moderate outflow of positions. In case of a repeated OI decline to levels of –20%, a Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/BcIGZkM0EZ — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 20, 2025 While we’re a long way from those extremes today, analysts are warning that if OI were to renew its plunge to –20% levels, we could be looking at a much sharper BTC correction—likely in the 5–15% range. OI is currently not in crisis, and therefore, we should not be in crisis either. But what is OI? What makes it potentially good or bad? And where, for now, does it reside on the good/bad spectrum? The moderate OI movement suggests that present market players are at best tentatively positioned. It seems that they are quite possibly waiting for a macro signal or an on-chain catalyst that is not forthcoming to drive the next significant market move. A Tale of Two Markets: Sentiment vs Strategy Data is shedding light on a burgeoning disparity between sentiment and strategy in the Bitcoin market. Retail investors seem a bit spooked—possibly swayed by the spell of recent volatility, current macroeconomic uncertainty, or just good old profit-taking after a super strong multi-month rally. The drop-off in activity from small wallets makes our ‘holdco’ in the Bitcoin market look less and less like a coiled spring ready to pop up and more like an average Joe just holding on for dear life. At the same time, institutional-sized investors and whale wallets are steadily increasing their positions. This kind of accumulation usually reveals a long-term, steadfast belief in the value of Bitcoin that goes far beyond the short-term price moves we see all the time. What is seen on the surface is panic, while deeper levels show positioning for the next rally. Market veterans have seen this pattern many times before. The split is not only significant; it is also meaningful. Big investors tend to stock up during the quiet times when main-street investors are absent. They are less concerned with short-term twists and turns—they think of those as “wash trades”—and more about taking a position when they think the price is right. Conclusion As Bitcoin steadies and stays above the price of $104,000, we could be witnessing in real-time what might be playing out a lot farther down the road. The tussle between elite wallets and retail wallets could be a prelude to something much more—if not for price, then for the nature of Bitcoin itself. Elites and retail are in direct conflict when it comes to the accumulation and distribution of Bitcoin. That is a hell of a lot more to be concerned about than price. A significant drop in open interest could mean another bearish episode for Bitcoin. But not all is bad. If we maintain the status quo and whale accumulation continues, once confidence floods back into the market, we could be poised for another leg up. In the Bitcoin universe, the hushed actions of major participants frequently make the most noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-22T03:07:39,"Ethereum’s Bullish Momentum Builds as Whales and Institutions Bet Big on Long-Term Growth","While Ethereum (ETH) is presently sitting near the all-important $2,500 price level, its fundamentals have never looked stronger. All across the board, the network’s underlying strength has been showing like gangbusters lately. With ever-increasing amounts of user activity, institutional-level accumulation, and other altcoin activity, there seems to be a full-blown setup with Ethereum and the entire crypto market for an altcoin rally in the near future. User Activity Surges as Network Growth Accelerates One of the most evident signs of Ethereum’s growing usefulness is the number of fresh addresses that appear every week. Between 800,000 and 1 million new Ethereum addresses are being created every week. Not only is this massive growth in fresh addresses a clear sign that not only are people making Ethereum accounts but also that they are making the accounts in a fashion that could largely be described as sustainable, it appears that Ethereum is doubling up in the old adage that any publicity is good publicity. Whether the new accounts are being used for dApps, DeFi, or merely as a store of value (which is how some people might describe the Bitcoin half of their investment), they’re all good signs. As Ethereum trades right at the $2,500 level, the utility and growth of the network continues looking healthier than ever. The amount of new weekly $ETH addresses created is ranging around 800K-1M per week, compared to about one third less at this point last year. pic.twitter.com/K1nxFBVlqL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 The strong developer community that surrounds Ethereum together with its unshakeable position as the main platform for smart contracts and decentralized finance has converted Ethereum into a real focal point for both individual and institutional users. This is a world in which even the most reliable paths can lead off a cliff, yet here is Ethereum, with always more and more new participators entering its ecosystem. That is just one visible metric, and by all appearances it is a strong one. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence in the Future Big Ethereum owners — often called “whales” — show no signs of slowing down. On-chain data suggests that these high-net-worth individuals are hard at work accumulating ETH, treating it as if tomorrow the supply could run out. This kind of ETH-hoarding behavior from whales usually reflects utter confidence in the future of the asset and often precedes some major price moves. This trend of accumulation not only helps give price support in uncertain times but also sends a small-investor signal that smart money is getting positioned for a possible breakout. The number of Ethereum addresses with large balances keeps growing, and the present market dynamics are so reminiscent of former conditions that came just before previous altcoin bull runs that they have some analysts chattering about an imminent Ethereum bull run. Ethereum whales are stacking $ETH like the supply runs out tomorrow. This is the biggest sign that Altcoin Season is right around the corner! pic.twitter.com/k4h0WVJcgu — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 19, 2025 Such trends are frequently early signs pointing to the approach of an “Altcoin Season” — that period in the market when alternative cryptocurrencies are performing tremendously well, often at the same time as Bitcoin is experiencing a substantial upswing. When might that be? Historically, if Ethereum isn’t the leader of the pack (which it often is, given its market cap), it’s at least a very close second, with a sizable difference between the performance of Ether (ETH) and BTC. Institutional Interest Reaches New Highs The most persuasive sign of Ethereum’s solidifying market position is the swelling level of investment from institutions. Not just individuals, but entities of all kinds are now pouring cash into what was once a fringe project. In total, a remarkable 38 institutional entities now hold more than $3 billion in Ethereum. That’s around 1.19 million ETH. And that puts the total ETH held by institutions just shy of 1% of the entire circulating supply. 38 institutions now hold $3 Billion+ in $ETH That’s 1.19M ETH — nearly 1% of all #Ethereum in circulation. Top holders include: 1⃣ Ethereum Foundation 2⃣ Coinbase 3⃣ Golem Foundation 4⃣ PulseChain 5⃣ SharpLink Big money is betting on Ethereum long-term. Are you? pic.twitter.com/9lrpAjXZLK — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) June 20, 2025 Some of the biggest names in crypto are among the top holders of ETH: the Ethereum Foundation, Coinbase, the Golem Foundation, PulseChain, and SharpLink, to name just a few. These entities are not merely buying ETH as a speculative asset and holding large quantities for their own benefit. Many are integrating Ethereum into their operations, development, or infrastructure in some way. Adding legitimacy and a layer of long-term stability to the network is the involvement of institutions in Ethereum. Unlike retail investors, who may enter and exit quickly based on price action, institutions tend to take longer-term positions. They make these moves for reasons more fundamental and strategic than anything driven by the short-term objectives usually found in retail trading. When institutions choose to deploy capital into a network like Ethereum, it definitely sends a positive signal. What is even more positive, however, is that over this past year, Ethereum has not only attracted institutional interest—it has captured substantial institutional capital. Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Ethereum’s price seems to be moving toward an area of stabilization around $2,500. Meanwhile, a number of metrics associated with Ethereum’s blockchain are registering very strong results. And there are unmistakable signs that powerful institutions and high-net-worth individuals are taking a serious interest in Ethereum. If anything, the opposite outcome of a collapse in Ethereum’s price seems very unlikely. And historically speaking, when confidence in Ethereum is running high, it tends to be a leading indicator that a nice little rally in the altcoin space is also coming into view. The crypto market seems to be on the verge of a new growth phase, with a fresh influx of capital and burgeoning network activity. In this situation, not only Ethereum’s status as the premier smart contract platform but also altcoins’ prospects appear to be gaining strength. Both analysts and investors will be keeping a close watch in the weeks to come. If the present trends maintain, Ethereum’s steady grind upward may be just the start of an even bigger move.

2025-06-22T03:04:59,"Altcoin ETFs on the Horizon: Analysts Predict a Major Shift for Crypto Markets in 2025","In a historic change that may reshape the crypto investment landscape, Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have significantly upped the ante on the approval odds of a wave of spot altcoin ETFs. In their latest analysis, they now rate most major altcoins with a 90%-to-95% chance of getting approved as ETFs in the U.S. by 2025, a development that would take institutional adoption of cryptos well beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even if the precise timing of these approvals is unknown, the SEC’s increased interaction with issuers is a very good sign. It’s very clear that the SEC is working with these issuers very directly, and it’s very likely these products are going to get a green light now. If they do, and they’re Bitcoin ETFs, then that’s clearly a very positive sign for the cryptocurrency ecosystem—just like the altcoin surge. The Next Phase: Altcoin ETFs Could Spark a Full-Fledged Altseason Analysts view the potential for multiple altcoin ETFs as a reason to now reshape expectations across the industry. They believe that the stage is now set for what could be a significant altseason—one not driven solely by retail hype, but also by serious institutional participation. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Several important altcoins, like Litecoin, Solana, and XRP, have already been applied for with the necessary authorities to set up Spot ETFs. Each of these assets now has a very good 95% likelihood—a number that regulators and businesses alike can get behind—of being approved within the next year. Close on their heels are a few other popular cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin and Cardano, which have a 90% likelihood of following suit in the same time frame. Younger or lesser-known assets like Sui and TRON are said to be at the beginning stages of the ETF filing process. “Most of these approvals are expected to start rolling out from the third to the fourth quarters of 2025, making the second half of that year a potentially transformative period for the crypto market. We could actually see some of these assets potentially double or triple in value if their underlying technology proves out and if the ETF narrative plays out in an unimpeded manner. ” This level of optimism stems from the approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were officially green-lighted in early 2024. These investment vehicles have helped drive demand for Bitcoin, pushing its price to new highs. Ethereum has followed closely behind in terms of price and has also received ETF approvals. Together, these developments position several other large-cap crypto assets as potential candidates for new ETF products. What Makes ETF Approval So Important? ETFs are an increasingly investor-friendly way to gain exposure to asset classes. Spot ETFs, which track the price of the underlying asset, allow individuals and institutions to invest in crypto assets through regulated financial products. They exist at the intersection of traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain. #Altcoin ETFs are coming and the stage is being set for a proper altseason. Multiple altcoins now have active Spot ETF filings and some of them have a 95% approval chance this year. $LTC , $SOL , $XRP have 95% odds of approval in 2025. $DOGE , $ADA , $DOT , $AVAX have 90% odds of… pic.twitter.com/DB3Qh1Z9VU — Ted (@TedPillows) June 21, 2025 Three key benefits come with each ETF approval: 1. Improved transparency: ETFs have simple and straightforward structures that investors can understand. 2. Enhanced market efficiency: ETFs contribute to market efficiency; they cannot be priced inaccurately for any sustained length of time without some form of arbitrage being executed. 3. Broadened access to investment opportunities: Whereas many of the indexes against which ETFs are benchmarked are not tradable themselves, the ETFs that track those indexes are. Inflows from institutions. Huge investors—hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers—almost always prefer to invest in products that are regulated. They can invest directly in crypto assets, but if they want to put in a huge amount of capital, they almost always go with a product like an ETF. Why? Because those products allocate capital to the underlying assets without requiring the institutions to deal with custody of the assets or with the kind of exchanges that are not regulated. New investor accessibility. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make it simpler for ordinary investors to acquire altcoin exposure through traditional brokerage wrappers, IRAs, and 401(k) retirement accounts. This vastly widens the user base for these assets. Legitimacy from regulations. When the SEC or any other regulatory body gives the nod to an asset’s framework, this kind of approval and oversight can only help in winning wider acceptance for the asset itself. Media exposure tends to follow. Such is the kind of long-term, sustainable path that any asset would hope to tread. Spot Bitcoin ETFs clearly drove the dynamics described above. They were expected to bring in large amounts of inflows because they were expected to be very safe and also because they were the first Bitcoin ETFs that could be bought in the U.S. They were meant to track the spot price of Bitcoin. And they did. But also shortly afterward, in mid-2023, they sparked another wave of bullish momentum for Bitcoin itself and also for all other cryptocurrencies. Analysts now think we could see a similar wave of bullish momentum for altcoins if/when their own ETFs get launched. TradFi Turns Its Gaze Toward Altcoins This trend holds a broader implication: that conventional finance is now looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum and is seriously considering a number of other cryptocurrencies as well. Large-cap altcoins, many of which have real-world utility and offer innovative uses of blockchain technology, are now in the sights of not just private wealth managers, but also standard portfolio managers and ETF providers. If the current odds are to be believed, a trio of upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could pave the way for a profusion of ‘altcoin’ investing—those aren’t Bitcoin or Ethereum—in the financial mainstream. Should these funds see the light of day, 2025 may be remembered as the year of such ‘altcoin’ penetration in price structure. The crypto market is primed for a new potential breakout, but this time it might not be Bitcoin leading the charge. Instead, the diverse and dynamic ecosystem of altcoins—especially the larger ones like Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple—could be the catalyst for the next crypto breakout. Why is this? It’s mostly down to ETF developments. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

2025-06-22T03:00:50,"XRP Builds Pressure Below $3 As RSI Breakdown Signals Imminent Move – Analyst","XRP prices recorded an overall 1.26% loss in the past week amidst a crypto market struggling to re-establish a bullish trajectory. After reaching a local price peak of $2.58 on May 15, XRP has witnessed an extensive correction forcing prices to around $2.06. Interestingly, prominent market expert with X username CasiTrade has shared a bullish prediction hinting at an upcoming price reversal. Flush Then Fly? XRP Chart Patterns Point To Key Support Test In an X post on June 20, CasiTrades postulates that XRP is currently at a technical inflection point with significant bearings on its next price movement. Based on the presented daily trading chart, it can be inferred that the prominent altcoin is on the edge of a price breakout or breakdown due to the formation of a descending triangle pattern. However, CasiTrades states that there are larger implications in recent developments of the relative strength index (RSI). Notably, the analyst explains the XRP daily RSI trendline is now breaking down signaling a confluence of market conditions including declining volatility, muted price action, and, most importantly, an accumulation of pressure within the market which aligns closely with the tightening range seen in the descending triangle. CasiTrades predicts the impending release is likely to initially target lower price regions before initiating a price upswing. The trading expert views this potential breakdown not as bearish price capitulation but rather a final flush needed to gather enough liquidity for a bullish reversal. In this regard, CasiTrades has highlighted potential support zones to be around $2.01, $1.90 and $1.55, all which the analyst states remain valid until XRP achieves a decisive price close above $3. However, the projected bullish reversal may occur via two routes. Firstly, CasiTrades states that XRP could dip cleanly to any of the highlighted supported zones before executing a V-shaped marker recovery that would indicate the altcoin has found a market bottom. Alternatively, XRP may also get close to the support zones and stall or even produce an early price bounce. In this case, the analyst predicts the token may witness a final exhaustion downward wave before the expected bullish reversal. XRP Price Overview At press time, XRP trades at $2.13 reflecting a 1.29% price loss in the past day. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency also retains negative performances on larger time frames with a loss of 10.39% on the monthly chart respectively. In making any price gains, the market bulls must overcome the key resistance level at $2.37, a successful breakout beyond which would pave the way for a rally toward the $2.60 mark.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-pressure-3-rsi-breakdown-signals-imminent-move/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Descending Triangle Pattern|XRP bullish reversal|XRP daily RSI|XRP Support|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T02:49:05,"IBIT: Patience Needed As Bitcoin Consolidates (Rating Downgrade)","Summary Downgrading IBIT from buy to hold due to stalled momentum and lack of breakout above May highs, despite strong year-to-date returns. Bitcoin's price action is mixed versus gold and equities, with recent consolidation and divergence from traditional risk assets raising caution. Potential downside support levels are near $98,000, with risk-off catalysts like geopolitical tensions or weak economic data threatening further declines. Corporate and retail buying provide a floor, but I remain neutral until a breakout above $112,000 or a retest of key support levels occurs. Like so many asset classes and industry groups, the mantra is “wait and see” in the crypto space. Bitcoin holds below its May all-time high near $112,000 heading into the second half, and I am downgrading the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) from a buy to a hold. I was bullish on the world’s largest cryptocurrency back in March , following the steep selloff that ensued after the January peak around President Trump’s inauguration. Up a fast 24% in just a few months since my sanguine call, I am concerned about IBIT’s momentum. Let’s roll through the key crypto charts and tables that may offer clues about where bitcoin may go in the months ahead. Bitcoin Hovers Below Its May All-Time High Seeking Alpha According to the issuer , IBIT aims to generally track the performance of the bitcoin price. The ETF now houses more than $70 billion in assets under management, and it enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. First, it’s important to point out that bitcoin, along with gold and ex-US stocks, have offered some of the best total returns so far this year. So, absolute momentum is not bad when zooming out. But the ultimate breakout IBIT bulls had hoped for in May has not come to pass. YTD Absolute and Risk-Adjusted Returns: Bitcoin Strong Goldman Sachs In the past few years, we’ve seen bitcoin buck gold trends. For instance, when gold rallies, bitcoin has generally consolidated or even drifted lower; when gold trades sideways, that’s usually when we see IBIT thrust higher. Since gold notched a record high close to $3,500 per ounce two months ago, bitcoin has not enjoyed the same kind of buying pressure as seen in previous cycles. That’s a yellow flag for me. Of course, IBIT is up 11% so far in 2025, outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) by more than eight percentage points. The bitcoin ETF remains significantly below gold’s impressive 28% YTD advance, however. So, the relative strength situation is mixed, depending on if you compare bitcoin to the S&P 500 or the precious metal. Gold Leading Bitcoin YTD, Both Beating the SPX StockCharts.com On an absolute price trend basis, bitcoin has chopped around for more than a month now, and amid geopolitical turmoil and a sagging US Dollar Index (DXY), I’d have liked to have seen better price action with IBIT. Moreover, the Nasdaq 100 ETF ( QQQ ) has been in rally mode, for the most part, since early May. Often, with the Qs ascend, IBIT follows suit. Once again, we’re not seeing that today—another caution sign, in my view. BTCUSD Consolidating From $101,000 to $112,000 Trading Economics Where might we see buyers step up to the plate with bitcoin? I assert now is the ideal time to apply Fibonacci retracement lines to help identify future support spots. Notice in the chart below that if we plot the Fibos from the $74,400 post-Liberation Day low to the May 22 all-time high, we see that the 38.2% retracement comes into play just below the $98,000 level. I could see that playing out—a bearish breakdown below the June low of $100,000 and change could shake loose the weak hands, setting the stage for a swift move below $100k, and a fast rally thereafter. Another scenario—a more bearish one—takes bitcoin toward its March rebound high in the upper $80,000s. That’s the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the Q2 rally. What might cause that? Well, if we see risk-off price action across asset classes in the weeks ahead, perhaps driven by an escalation in the Middle East geopolitical conflicts between Israel and Iran, or a President Trump ratcheting up tariffs with the July 9 reciprocal tariff relief deadline coming closer into view, then there would probably be selling pressure on IBIT. Another bearish catalyst may simply be deteriorating economic data. The labor market is clearly softening, while the Federal Reserve is hesitant to cut rates—that sets up for a rocky start to the third quarter, potentially. Bitcoin Technicals: Eyeing a $98,000 Downside Target, Equivalent to $55.70 on IBIT StockCharts.com Despite the possible headwinds, we continue to see a steady diet of corporations buying up bitcoin. In late May, GameStop ( GME ) was the latest firm to announce it was adding to its bitcoin reserve. Retail investors also bought the bitcoin dip in April, per EPFR flow of funds data. Corporate Bitcoin Buying Acts as a Possible Floor Seeking Alpha Strong April Bitcoin Inflows, A ""Buy-the-Dip"" Mentality BofA Global Research Furthermore, I remain generally upbeat about the stock market , underpinned by resilient corporate earnings and investor skepticism. That backdrop should support bitcoin as a risk-on asset for now. I would become more bullish on IBIT if it were to probe that $98,000 spot, or upon a breakout above the record high of $112,000. For now, a measured stance is warranted on bitcoin as it keeps on coiling. Looking ahead, prediction markets point to bitcoin perhaps reaching above $130,000 by the end of the year. In the short term, seasonal data points to tailwinds lasting through July. Prediction Markets Point to $136k Bitcoin By Year-End (Max Price) Kalshi Bitcoin Seasonality: Bullish July Trends, Bearish August-September Barchart The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on IBIT. I was bullish on bitcoin toward the end of the first quarter, and after a white-knuckle period around and just after Liberation Day, crypto buying ensued. But with month-long consolidation and softer momentum trends, a wait-and-see approach is justified.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796318-ibit-patience-needed-as-bitcoin-consolidates-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD|IBIT",cryptocompare
2025-06-22T02:44:11,"SEI PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (June 21) – SEI Signals Potential Bullish Move Following a 30% Recovery in a Week","Amid the current market clampdown, SEI shows strength following a daily surge since Tuesday. While signalling a trend shift, the market structure appears bullish on the day as it forms a double-bottom pattern. Following market ups and downs since the start of the second quarter, SEI finally found solid ground and regained strength on the daily chart. This came after reestablishing support above the $0.15 level earlier this week, and as we can see, the price resurged and increased consistently until it crossed over a month resistance line yesterday. While this signals a trend shift, the crypto is steadily gaining traction daily. Considering the latest price actions, we can say the bulls are back in control on the daily chart. A daily surge above $0.28 should confirm a neckline breakout of the double-bottom pattern before rallying hard on the short-term scale. The reverse would be the case if it dips below April’s low. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the crypto market is surrounded by a negative sentiment due to the recent drop in Bitcoin’s price. If SEI follows suit, it may take a downturn until it finds solid ground for a rebound. As of now, it shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart. SEI’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main obstacle for the bulls right now is the $0.274 resistance level. Overcoming it should validate a breakout to $0.347 – February’s high – and potentially $0.434. In case of a pullback, SEI may retest the $0185 level (coincides with the broken resistance line) as support before rebounding. The main holding support levels are $0.159 and $0.13.

2025-06-22T02:30:18,"Will Bitcoin, XRP, and Aptos Take the Lead Heading Into Q4 2025?","As we head into Q3, market watchers are closely examining if BTC, XRP and Aptos are primed for a strong finish towards Q4 2025. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new market player, is already seizing the moment. Bitcoin Testing Key Levels Bitcoin kicked off June with a slight correction that saw the token plummet from $111,000 to around $104,000 by mid-month. It’s currently testing its 50-day simple moving average, a critical technical support. Notably, if this level fails to hold, analysts warn BTC could dip below $100,000. Still, optimism hasn’t disappeared. Many short-term traders are eyeing a potential breakout to $120,000. A high-volume close above $110,000 would reignite bullish sentiment. Longer-term trends suggest strength. Bitcoin is in the third year of its typical four-year cycle, historically its most explosive phase. If past cycles repeat, BTC could climb over 120% in 2025, potentially touching $205,000 before year-end. On-chain data backs this up, with the Realized Cap metric hitting all-time highs, signaling strong accumulation by long-term holders. XRP Stuck, But Loaded With Potential XRP has been trapped in a tight range between $2.10 and $2.40 for more than 200 days. The longest sideways move since its 2018–2020 slump. Currently trading between $2.13 and $2.26, it’s struggling to break past $2.30–$2.50 resistance. Technical indicators paint a hopeful picture. A falling wedge formation and MACD crossover signal bullish momentum building. A breakout above $2.50 could trigger a rally toward $3 or higher. Some bold forecasts put XRP targets at $8, $12, or even $19 in this cycle. Iif legal clarity and institutional adoption fall in line. But if it fails to break resistance, a dip toward $2.00 remains possible. The $28.7 billion market cap shows it’s still a heavyweight, but for now, it’s in limbo. Aptos Quietly Gaining Strength Aptos (APT) is showing signs of breakout potential. Recently, APT climbed past the $5 mark, signaling a possible bullish flag pattern. Now, the digital asset trades between $5.04 and $5.06. This has been supported by strong volume and accumulation patterns. Even after a 19% monthly decline, investor interest hasn’t faded. On June 12, a token unlock event released 1.79% of its circulating supply, causing volatility. At the same time, this also cleared a hurdle for future growth. It is worth mentioning that the network hosts over 1,000 developers and 300+ new Web3 projects, including major strides in gaming and NFTs. Its total value locked (TVL) has reportedly surged past $800 million, and possibly even $3 billion. With a market cap of $2.85 billion and 641 million tokens circulating, Aptos holds strong upside potential. Analysts forecast a 2025 range between $9 and $21. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Strong Entrance Into Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE i s attracting heightened attention from investors, and analysts due to its deeply held values, understanding their impact. Backed by a capped supply, fully audited by blockchain security firm HashEx, and boasting strong investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a top contender. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already staged with momentum, evidently, previous stages sold out instantly. On-chain data shows rising whale interest, and large presale allocations have already been scooped up. Its appeal lies in its community-first model, transparency, and strategic timing. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could outpace even the top-tier assets in the coming months, with some projecting explosive gains of up to 23,800%. Final Verdict Bitcoin, XRP, and Aptos each show potential to lead heading into Q4—but none without challenges. BTC needs volume. XRP needs breakout confirmation. Aptos needs post-unlock follow-through. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the ground up—with smart mechanics, growing demand, and analyst confidence all lining up.

2025-06-22T02:00:59,"XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications","XRP’s on-chain metrics are reportedly painting a foreboding picture for its price outlook, as data shows a steep 80% decline in new wallet creation over the past five months. This drop in network activity has sparked divided opinions between two expert analysts, with one casting doubts on XRP’s ability to reclaim the $3 mark, and the other rejecting such bearish predictions. XRP Price Surge To $3 Stalled In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst the ‘Coin Bureau’ highlights that XRP’s momentum appears to be fading fast as new on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a staggering 80% drop in wallet creation since January 2025. This sharp decline in network activity and growth has led the analyst to claim that the XRP price is unlikely to revisit the $3 level anytime soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight At the height of XRP’s 2024 rally, both its price and user activity surged in tandem. During that time, new wallet addresses soared to nearly 30,000 per day in November, coinciding with a sharp rally that sent the token’s price surging close to $3. However, the explosive rally proved short-lived, as momentum faded and prices have since reversed. As of mid-June 2025, Glassnode chart shows that new wallet creation has fallen drastically to around 2,000-5,000 per day, while daily active addresses plunged from 577,000 to just 34,000. XRP’s price, meanwhile, has settled just above $2 and has remained largely range-bound, failing to show signs of a sustained breakout. According to Coin Bureau, this significant drop in on-chain engagement indicates that interest in XRP may have dried up, removing one of the key drivers behind its previous rally. Without new users entering the ecosystem or existing ones increasing XRP’s on-chain activity, the analyst warns that the conditions necessary for an immediate $3 price reclaim aren’t present. Analyst Debunks Bearish Forecast While Coin Bureau’s data paints a picture of declining interest and slow price growth, one crypto expert, known as Moon Lambo on X, has pushed back against the bearish narrative. He argues that XRP’s network activity actually reflects growing strength and long-term confidence. The chart presented by the analyst, covering wallet creation data from June 2024 to June 2025, shows an undeniable spike in network activity between November and early January—a surge that peaked during a period of heightened market enthusiasm following the US elections. As the post-election euphoria faded and investor sentiment cooled off, XRP’s on-chain metrics, like daily new account creations, naturally returned to lower levels. Moon Lambo indicates that this drop does not reflect weakness in the XRP ecosystem, as Coin Bureau claimed. The analyst argues that the decline in activity was a healthy correction that occurred right after an abnormal spike in activity driven by macro excitement, and not a reflection of any breakdown in XRP’s fundamentals. To further support the bullish thesis, Moon Lambo pointed out that Google Trends shows that search interest in Bitcoin has declined significantly, confirming that the lull in on-chain activity is not exclusive to just XRP but reflective of a broader market cool-off.

2025-06-22T01:30:14,"Top Analyst Names XRP, Bitcoin, and Aptos as 2025’s Most Balanced Portfolio Holdings for Long-Term Investors","In a market marked by uncertainty and shifting regulatory winds, one leading analyst has pinpointed three digital assets—XRP, Bitcoin, and Aptos—as the cornerstones of a diversified, long-term crypto portfolio for 2025. Good year for XRP XRP’s path in 2025 has been defined by its legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple’s big win over the SEC this spring really changed the game for XRP. After agreeing to a settlement—yes, there was a fine, but Ripple also got back a chunk of its escrowed funds and saw those restrictive court orders lifted—suddenly the path to U.S. markets feels a lot clearer. You can practically feel the doors opening: futures-based XRP ETFs are already trading, and the buzz around a spot ETF approval grows louder every day. Investors who had been on the sidelines seem ready to jump back in, and charts are showing that once XRP pushes through its next hurdle, we could be looking at a fresh wave of buying. In short, the regulatory fog has lifted, and XRP is poised to be one of the first beneficiaries. Importantly, Ripple’s sustained accumulation of XRP on its balance sheet and its cooperative stance toward regulators underscore the company’s commitment to fostering a compliant, widely embraced payment network. Bitcoin BTC is The Bedrock of Crypto Portfolios Bitcoin is still the go-to when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Even with the headlines swirling about geopolitical unrest, it’s held steady above key price levels—proof that investors see it as a reliable anchor in a choppy market. Long-term projections for Bitcoin hinge on its dual role as both a digital store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic turbulence. Major financial institutions continue to allocate a fraction of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, while emerging investment vehicles—such as debt securities backed by BTC—have broadened market access. Technical analysts observe that Bitcoin is consolidating within a well-defined trading range; a sustained breakout to the upside could ignite fresh buying interest from both retail and professional investors. Moreover, the limited supply mechanism coded into Bitcoin’s protocol bolsters its scarcity narrative. As adoption deepens in sectors ranging from corporate treasuries to central bank experiments, Bitcoin’s position as the leading, most secure blockchain protocol remains unchallenged. For those building a core digital-asset holding, no alternative combines liquidity, brand recognition, and regulatory headroom quite like Bitcoin. Aptos: Innovation at the Vanguard of Layer-1 Blockchains Aptos has carved out a reputation as one of 2025’s most dynamic Layer-1 networks. Backed by performance-driven architecture and a growing roster of DeFi and data-feed integrations, Aptos offers both scalability and developer-friendly tooling. Recent months have seen the network integrate industry-standard oracles and onboard major lending protocols into its testnet environment, underscoring its commitment to robust, real-world use cases. Beyond purely technical metrics, Aptos has made strategic moves on the corporate front—acquiring overseas development teams and establishing regional outposts to foster deeper partnerships. Its leadership’s willingness to engage directly with regulators, including scheduled appearances before key U.S. legislative committees, signals a mature approach to compliance and governance. For long-term investors, Aptos represents exposure to next-generation blockchain capabilities that aim to support high-throughput applications without sacrificing security. As the network transitions token standards and expands its asset base, early adopters of Aptos stand to benefit from both protocol-level upgrades and ecosystem growth. Why investors want in on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as a standout in the 2025 altcoin cycle.The project cemented its token model by finalizing a fixed supply and reopening its presale to renewed investor interest. With a HashEx-audited smart contract and a pledge of 100% community ownership—free of venture capital control—the project emphasizes transparency and grassroots engagement. Upcoming staking rewards promise to deepen utility and incentivize long-term holding, reinforcing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s appeal as an early-stage opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exposure to innovative tokenomics and community-driven governance, rounding out a strategy designed for sustained performance in 2025 and beyond. Analysts are already projecting 40x-70x ROI by the end of the year. Final Thoughts- Portfolio Implications for Long-Term Investors By combining regulatory-cleared XRP, time-tested Bitcoin, growth-oriented Aptos, and innovative MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can achieve a diversified and balanced crypto allocation. Each asset brings a distinct catalyst profile, ranging from legal milestones and technical consolidation to ecosystem expansion.

2025-06-22T01:00:17,"Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500–$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone – Details","Since hitting a new all-time high almost a month ago, Bitcoin has done little to assure investors of intent to explore new price territories. Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500–$97,000: Bitcoin’s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin’s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 – $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 – $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote : “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The impact on crypto was instant. Traders dumped risk as the US joined Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign against Iran. The market panic came after days of speculation that Washington would side with Tel Aviv following Israel’s unilateral strike on Iranian territory — once again citing half a century of unproven nuclear weapons claims. The new US airstrikes have now confirmed its involvement. XRP drops, Ether struggles, Solana hit hardest As Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line, XRP dropped to $1.8, a 3.1% hit. Ether fell to $2,201, while Solana tumbled harder than the others, now sitting at $121, down over 5%. These moves erased all gains from earlier in the week. Meanwhile shortly after Trump’s post, Israel said it had killed Saeed Izadi, a senior commander in Iran’s Quds Force, during an airstrike on an apartment in Qom. Defense Minister Israel Katz called Izadi’s killing “a major achievement,” claiming he had supplied weapons and money to Hamas before its October 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza. Izadi had been on both US and British sanctions lists. While Israeli forces targeted Izadi in Qom, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed that five of its members died in separate strikes on Khorramabad, though Izadi was not named in their statement. Iranian outlets reported that a 16-year-old was killed and two others wounded in the Qom strike. Iranian state news agency Nour News said that 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured inside Iran since Israel began bombing on June 13. In retaliation, Iranian missile strikes have killed 24 civilians in Israel, according to Israeli officials. The air war is now dragging both sides into their worst conflict in decades. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said there will be no negotiations with Washington as long as the attacks continue. Speaking in Istanbul during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Araqchi said, “It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US.” A day earlier, Araqchi had met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in a last-ditch diplomatic attempt. That effort appears dead now. Trump, speaking Friday, said he would decide “within two weeks” whether to send more US forces to the conflict, depending on whether “people come to their senses.” He also claimed Iran could build a nuclear weapon in weeks, saying, “We can’t let that happen.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Fars News Agency reported that Israel struck the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the country’s most important atomic sites. It said there were no radioactive leaks, but damage assessments are still underway. Israel also said it launched a wave of attacks on missile storage and launch infrastructure, hitting multiple locations across Iran in a wider campaign.

2025-06-22T00:00:01,"Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms","According to an analysis posted on X by CRYPTOWZRD, Chainlink has closed the session with a bearish tone and is now testing the key $12.50 support level. With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token’s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin’s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market’s continued sensitivity to BTC’s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short‑lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin’s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower‑time‑frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK’s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market’s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85—marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

2025-06-21T23:45:37,"Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities? Read This Report First","Cryptocurrency crime may be evolving, but the share of illicit such transactions remains strikingly small. According to TRM Labs’ latest annual report on crypto crime, just 0.4% of all digital asset transaction volume in 2024 was linked to unlawful activity, marking a 51% drop from the previous year despite a surge in the overall market. Illicit Crypto Activity Plummets Even as Total Volume Soars According to the blockchain intelligence firm, the total transaction volume in the crypto sector increased by 56% last year, surpassing $10.6 trillion. However, estimated illegal flows fell sharply to around $45 billion, down from nearly $59 billion in 2023. The report indicated that crypto crime was mainly dominated by sanction evaders, scammers, and funds linked to blocklisted addresses. Collectively, these categories represented over 85% of the illicit volume identified by TRM. Additionally, networks like Tron, Ethereum, and Bitcoin remained the top venues for such activity. Interestingly, while Tron alone accounted for 58% of all criminal flows, its illicit transaction volume actually fell by half compared to 2023. TRM attributed some of this success to the effectiveness of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a pioneering public-private initiative targeting USDT misuse on Tron. Since its launch, it has helped freeze over $130 million , and nearly 20% of blocklisted USDT on Tron has already been returned to victims or authorities. Meanwhile, targeted sanctions against major Russian and Iranian exchanges such as Garantex and Nobitex, recently the target of a $49 million hack , have throttled inflows to restricted jurisdictions by 33%. Persistent Threats and the Evolving Criminal Playbook Despite the overall decline, TRM raised the alarm on emerging trends demanding vigilance. It stated that terrorism financing, particularly involving groups like ISIS-Khorasan (ISKP), is increasingly relying on crypto, with stablecoins remaining the primary choice despite a growing interest in privacy coins like Monero (XMR). Hacks also witnessed an uptick, with $2.2 billion stolen, representing a 17% increase, primarily targeting DeFi protocols. As has been reported by other researchers, North Korean actors were disproportionately responsible, stealing nearly $800 million using sophisticated methods, often focusing on private key theft. In addition, their laundering tactics have adapted, utilizing decentralized bridges and moving funds rapidly across chains to make recovery exceptionally difficult for law enforcement. But perhaps the most worrisome emerging threat is the rapid adoption of AI by fraudsters. According to TRM, criminals are now using large language models (LLMs) to craft highly personalized scam personas, generate convincing deepfake videos for extortion and investment scams, and produce sophisticated phishing messages. They are also using AI to create fake IDs to bypass KYC, and even generate non-consensual explicit imagery. The blockchain research firm is expecting a significant expansion of AI-powered crime in 2025. The post Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities?

2025-06-21T23:30:40,"SHIB Price Forecasts from $0.01 to $1: Here are Likely Timelines","Shiba Inu continues to attract interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and market analysts, despite its current underperformance. Some remain optimistic about the token’s long-term prospects, envisioning potential price milestones as high as $0.01 or even $1. While these forecasts are ambitious, proponents cite past market behavior and future project developments as reasons to remain hopeful. Current Market Standing The token is currently trading at $0.00001105, showing a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.17% decline in the last week. Over the last 30 days, the token has lost 27.98% of its value. According to CoinMarketCap , SHIB holds the 19th position among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of approximately $6.7 billion. Despite recent losses, long-term supporters believe SHIB could still achieve substantial gains, referencing its explosive growth during the 2020–2021 bull run when it surged by over 150,000,000%. Among the SHIB community, the possibility of the token reaching $0.01 is often referred to as the “one-cent dream.” Achieving this would require an increase of over 87,000% from its current price. However, such a price would give SHIB a market valuation of nearly $5.89 trillion, an amount that far exceeds the current total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. Luis Delgado, a market observer, has expressed optimism about this possibility. He believes that upcoming initiatives from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, could potentially drive significant upward momentum. Delgado has stated that SHIB was conceptually designed to reach around the $0.01 level and maintains that long-term market dynamics could support this goal. Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, known as Lucie, has also echoed this sentiment. While she acknowledged that achieving $0.01 would require time, she emphasized that it remains a realistic target given sufficient development and market support. Possibility of Reaching $1 A $1 price point for SHIB is considered even more improbable by most analysts, as it would require a surge of nearly 8.8 million percent. At this valuation, SHIB’s market cap would exceed $589 trillion, significantly surpassing the value of global financial assets and even the total money supply, which was estimated at $129 trillion in Q2 2024. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Still, the $1 forecast is occasionally discussed within the community. CoinW , a cryptocurrency exchange, included SHIB’s potential rise to $1 in a recent public poll alongside other bullish predictions for major cryptocurrencies. Lucie also referenced ChatGPT’s view that a $1 price, while extremely challenging, is not entirely impossible if several favorable conditions align, including widespread adoption, extensive token burns, and a strong bull market. However, many analysts disagree. TradeCityPro , a contributor on TradingView, considers the $1 goal unrealistic due to the market cap implications. Similarly, Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie noted that SHIB will not reach such extreme valuations unless a large portion of its supply, currently at 589.25 trillion tokens, is removed from circulation. Forecast Timelines Neither Delgado nor Lucie has provided specific timelines for when SHIB might reach $0.01 or $1. To address this gap, predictions from platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon offer some guidance. According to Changelly, SHIB could reach the $0.01 mark by September 2040. Telegaon shares a similar estimate, projecting that SHIB may hit $0.08 by the end of 2040 and could even surpass $1 by 2050, reaching up to $1.06 under highly favorable circumstances. While there is a strong base of support for optimistic price targets, reaching $0.01 or $1 would require unprecedented market movements or a dramatic reduction in Shiba Inu’s circulating supply. As it stands, these milestones remain speculative and should be viewed with caution. The feasibility of such growth hinges on fundamental changes in tokenomics, adoption rates, and broader market dynamics.

2025-06-21T23:30:24,"Can Solana and Bitcoin Match the Growth Outlook of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x Projections?","While Bitcoin and Solana continue to hold commanding positions in the digital asset landscape, a rising force is drawing sharper focus from strategic investors and analysts alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its early momentum accelerating and buyer interest increasing daily, the question now is whether legacy giants like BTC and SOL can keep pace with the explosive growth forecasted for this high-potential altcoin. Bitcoin trades firmly above $105,000, bolstered by inflows into its spot ETFs and increasing alignment with institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem is evolving rapidly, preparing for a groundbreaking Alpenglow upgrade that could push transaction finality into sub-second territory. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding its narrative — not by replacing Bitcoin or Solana, but by carving out a distinct lane of ROI-focused opportunity that’s becoming difficult to ignore. Demand Is Shifting as Strategic Investors Seek Asymmetric Upside The high-cap status of Bitcoin and Solana means their growth potential is now largely tied to macro trends, ETF flows, and network upgrades. Bitcoin’s recent policy boost — with the U.S. government establishing a strategic crypto reserve funded by seized assets — signals strong top-down support. Likewise, Solana’s institutional traction is reflected in its $250M USDC minting and over $7.9M in daily network revenue. But that level of stability comes with a trade-off: reduced explosive upside. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With thousands already gaining early access, crypto insiders say it’s becoming one of the most actively watched projects of the year. Analysts tracking wallet behavior report surging participation in private access rounds, suggesting high conviction among early buyers. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outrun the Top Layer-1s Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. Its upcoming Alpenglow upgrade — replacing Proof-of-History with Rotor and Votor layers — is expected to slash finality times from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. This positions SOL as a powerful platform for gaming, trading, and on-chain finance. In parallel, Ethereum-native developers are entering the Solana ecosystem through Solidity tooling enhancements, creating further developer momentum. Bitcoin, for its part, remains a macro asset favorite. The passage of the GENIUS Act and the executive order for a strategic crypto reserve — including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP — further elevates its institutional status. ETF inflows exceed $36 billion, outperforming even gold since launch. Still, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may outperform every token this cycle due to its current positioning. With no venture capital dilution, a capped supply, and fully audited smart contracts, the foundation is being laid for what some traders describe as a “top-tier asymmetric opportunity.” High-Volume Buyers Signal What’s Coming As Solana processes tens of millions in staking activity and stablecoin volume, and Bitcoin garners support from firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, the volume metrics for MAGACOIN FINANCE tell a different story — one of breakout positioning. Crypto trackers have flagged recurring early buys and aggressive tiered entry in recent rounds, indicating confidence that extends beyond retail speculation. The structure of its entry model — including time-sensitive access mechanics — has created urgency among investors aiming to get positioned before major listings. Some early-stage analysts have pointed to similar early accumulation patterns observed in previous cycles, just before top-performing altcoins exploded. Whether that trajectory repeats remains to be seen, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has certainly established itself as a project with a sharp growth vector. Is This the Altcoin That Breaks Out in 2025? Bitcoin and Solana offer massive scale and global name recognition. Bitcoin is being labeled “digital gold” again, as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty steer investors toward hard assets. Solana, with its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and $13 billion in stablecoin value, continues to attract developers, projects, and institutional transactions at an impressive rate. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is not aiming to compete with scale — it’s targeting velocity. Momentum. Early access ROI. With every forecast, every chart, and every tracked buyer position, the evidence points in one direction: up. Strategic buyers aren’t waiting for a green light — they’re already in. As analysts run models for the second half of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being placed in an elite category of potential altcoin outperformers. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana remain pillars of strength in the ever-evolving crypto market. BTC’s alignment with macro policy and ETF success has solidified its reputation as a hedge asset, while Solana continues to set technical benchmarks with its high-speed performance and institutional utility. Yet, the landscape of opportunity is changing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a category-defining asset, not because it mimics the giants, but because it follows a different playbook. With strong early participation, analyst endorsements, and high-volume buy-ins accelerating, it’s no longer just an altcoin to watch — it’s one to act on. For investors seeking sharp upside, well-structured tokenomics, and early positioning before public listing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention. The movement has started — and it’s unfolding in real time.

But prominent attorney Bill Morgan has publicly cast doubt on these rumors. Is The US Planning To Seize Ripple’s Escrowed XRP? According to widely followed crypto analyst John Squire, the United States government could potentially take control of the XRP tokens currently held in Ripple’s escrow. This revelation comes at a significant time, following President Donald Trump’s previous confirmation of plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile holding cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple’s XRP. However, Bill Morgan refuted claims that the US government intends to utilize XRP as part of a broader strategy to support its financial system. “No it won’t,” Morgan asserted in a post on X. Another industry commentator, going by the online alias Pumpius , also informed his X followers about the rumors about the US authorities potentially repurposing Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of the national financial reserves. Pumpius compared the XRP scenario to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were once considered unlikely but ultimately became a reality, indicating that the Ripple-affiliated crypto could make its way to US reserves. Notably, the longstanding Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, spurring optimism within the community. Regulatory clarity on XRP’s legal status is stirring speculation about its potential inclusion. A host of companies have in recent months announced reserves of the Ripple-created cryptocurrency. Singapore-based Web3 company Trident Digital announced it will start a strategic XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Others like Webus, VivoPower, and Wellgistics have also announced XRP-centric reserves. These moves are indicative of growing institutional interest in Ripple’s XRP ecosystem. While Ripple’s technology is gaining traction among corporations, claims related to US reserves remain unsubstantiated. The fourth-largest crypto is down 1.1% in the past 24 hours, alongside a slight correction in the broader crypto market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-inclusion-reports-in-u-s-national-reserve-reaches-fever-pitch-as-prominent-attorney-pushes-back/,"ADA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T22:14:04,"Norway Places Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining Data Centres to Prioritise Productive Industries","Norway announced plans to ban new data centres, purpose-built for crypto mining, to conserve electricity for more productive businesses, such as industries that employ more Norwegians and improve the country’s economy. Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies use substantial electricity to validate their ecosystems. In April 2024, the Norwegian government announced plans to restrict data centres to focus resources on more productive forms of work. Norway’s digitisation Minister, Karianne Tung, said the initiative aimed to control and limit undesirable projects such as crypto mining. Terje Aasland, Energy Minister for Norway, said that the main impetus for temporarily banning crypto mining data centres was meeting the nation’s climate targets. Aasland said crypto mining was incompatible with the government’s climate targets because the technology uses excess electricity and doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the nation’s long-term investments. Norway has a history of cracking down on crypto mining. In 2022, the government proposed ending tax incentives for the crypto mining industry, forcing the sector to pay the standard rate for electricity. Trygve Slagsvold, Finance Minister for Norway, said the move was about prioritising energy to benefit the whole community. Slagsvold pointed out that crypto does little to help the local community, yet uses tremendous energy. Norway has been an attractive destination for Bitcoin miners because it powers its grid with 92% of its energy from hydropower. Another 7% of energy is powered by wind sources, making the country an incredibly resourceful economy as far as climate targets are concerned. However, this is not enough for the Norwegian government because it is concerned about the long-term viability of crypto mining. Residents of Hadsel, a Norwegian province, petitioned the government in October 2024 to shut down a local Bitcoin mine. Yet, they suffered a rude shock when their electricity prices skyrocketed due to energy companies accounting for lost revenue. Venture capitalists quickly pointed out that residents suffered when the government targeted Bitcoin. However, the mayor of Hadsel, Kjell-Borge Freiberg, said that residents had been complaining about the noise emanating from the Bitcoin mining data centre. The Bitcoin mining operations produced 20% of the energy company’s revenue. When the Bitcoin mine was shut down, the energy company passed on its lost revenue to consumers. It is also possible that the energy company is punishing the residents for disrupting its bottom line. The energy company, however, may lament that one customer could disrupt their business model by shutting down operations. It is estimated that residents of Hadsel, due to the closure of the mine, will pay an extra $235 to $280 on their annual electricity bill. Russia implemented a mining ban on ten regions, including ones that already experienced a vulnerable energy grid. Many countries, such as Norway, are taking a critical stance towards crypto mining, at times for meeting climate targets, while at other times to restrict the spread of anonymous currencies. Energy-rich countries, such as Norway, are budgeting their energy use to prioritise their grid for what they believe are more productive industries. Miners must either remain in the country, invest in low-power consumables, or relocate to another country. There is also the option to switch completely to proof-of-stake methods to appease the Norwegian government and make a profit at the same time. In 2024, Norway first attempted to scrutinize the crypto mining industry by announcing a new set of regulations to shape the market in a way that they felt was appropriate, specifically to adhere to their climate change targets and beliefs about sustainability. The new regulations started this process by requiring all data centres engaged in crypto mining to register their activities. The Norwegian government, however, is adamant that the regulations were not intended to punish the crypto industry but were designed to better align the industry with national targets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/norway-places-temporary-ban-on-crypto-mining-data-centres-to-prioritise-productive-industries/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Norway",cryptocompare
