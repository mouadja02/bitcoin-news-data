2025-06-22T10:59:16,"New Crypto Projects to Watch After Trump’s Iran Airstrikes","Markets just got rattled. After Trump ordered airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, crypto took a tumble. XRP slid nearly 16% in the last month, dipping from around $2.47 to $2.04 amid panic across the market. Meanwhile, $595M in bullish bets were wiped out during the crash, as U.S. military action triggered massive liquidations across Bitcoin, Ether and major altcoins. In times like these, meme coins and high-risk tokens can either crater or skyrocket – all depending on where investors place their bets. With volatility spiking, crypto presales and speculative coins have the chance to steal the spotlight. Here are three new crypto projects worth watching right now. Markets in Turmoil as U.S. Airstrikes Rock Iran and Crypto Alike First, let’s unpack what just happened. On June 21, President Trump ordered precision airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The attack followed escalating tensions in the Gulf, with U.S. officials citing renewed nuclear enrichment activity and regional security threats. Within hours, markets reacted. Oil prices spiked, gold jumped, and crypto – known for its volatility – saw sharp red across the board. XRP , a major altcoin, continued its month-long slide, nearing the $2 mark. More importantly, the fear-driven selloff triggered a wave of forced liquidations: over 172K leveraged traders were wiped out in 24 hours, erasing $595M in bullish crypto bets. Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped several percent before recovering slightly, showing just how sensitive the market is to geopolitical shocks. Now, with traditional coins reeling, attention is turning to speculative assets, as traders hunt for narrative-driven rebound plays that could outpace the majors. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The First Solana Layer 2 Is Built for Speed Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana, created to solve the exact issues that have plagued the network for years: congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. By enhancing Solana’s already blazing speed and combining it with the vast liquidity of Ethereum, Solaxy delivers a multichain solution that’s fast, reliable, and ready for the next generation of DeFi and meme coins. $SOLX is the native token of the Solaxy blockchain and will live on both Ethereum and Solana, giving users seamless access to the most powerful ecosystems in crypto. With tools that democratize high-frequency meme coin trading, putting sniper bot precision into the hands of regular traders. Solaxy levels the playing field in explosive new markets. $SOLX is currently priced at $0.001766 with $56M raised in presale. And today is the last day to buy the token at this price before the token launch. As crypto reels from Trump’s airstrikes, Solaxy offers the kind of speed and stability that traders are desperate for right now. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Meme Coin That Actually Pays You in Bitcoin BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t your average meme coin – it’s a full-throttle, community-driven ride built to chase Bitcoin’s legendary climb to $1M. While most meme coins trade on hype alone, $BTCBULL brings real rewards to the table. As Bitcoin hits major price milestones (like $150K, or $200K), $BTCBULL holders earn actual Bitcoin straight to their wallets. Just remember that you need to buy and hold the token in Best Wallet in order to receive Bitcoin airdrops. No complex BRC-20s, no fuss – just link up with Best Wallet and get rewarded in the king of crypto. $BTCBULL also uses milestone-based burns to reduce token supply as Bitcoin rises, turning every new all-time high into a catalyst for $BTCBULL’s scarcity and value. Think of it as a turbocharged meme coin strapped to Bitcoin’s moon mission. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002575, with $7.2M raised in presale. It’s the only meme project that fuses $BTC’s long-term strength with community-powered upside. As markets wobble from Trump’s Iran airstrikes, $BTCBULL offers a rare blend: meme-fueled energy plus real Bitcoin rewards when the rebound kicks in. 3. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) – Meme Culture Meets Layer‑2 Performance Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the first meme‑coin built on its own EVM-compatible Layer‑2 blockchain, recently launched to solve Ethereum’s gas pain and congestion for meme projects. It’s like a custom racing strip just for meme traders – zero buy/sell tax, ultra‑low fees, sniper‑bot protections, and blazing-fast transactions. Its native token, $LILPEPE, fuels governance, transaction fees, staking rewards, and access to ‘Pepe’s Pump Pad,’ a launchpad for safe meme‑coin drops. The presale has raised $1.7M so far, and current price sits at $0.0012 per token. Stage 1 was sold out in 72 hours, and Stage 2 filled fast – underscoring strong community demand. With audit-backed smart contracts and a roadmap that includes centralized listings and Layer‑2 rollouts, Little Pepe blends meme hype with real infrastructure. Perfect timing as traders search for safe, narrative-driven plays in the post‑crash shake‑out. Big Moves, Bigger Risks Looking to ride the market rebound? Solaxy brings the speed and scalability traders need, BTC Bull Token delivers meme-powered Bitcoin upside, and Little Pepe offers a fresh take on meme coins with real infrastructure. Each project taps into a different corner of the market, but all come with high risk and high reward potential. Stay sharp, stay curious, and maybe don’t bet the farm.

2025-06-22T10:38:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Will Outperform Ethereum’s 92,000% Growth History","Ethereum’s rise from under a dollar to over $4,000 became one of the most talked-about investment stories in crypto. The 92,000% return was real — but it took years to develop, with slow adoption, infrastructure delays, and high user friction along the way. Bitcoin Solaris is operating on a much tighter timeline. Token price has already moved from $5 to $8 during the presale. Over $5 million has been raised. More than 11,500 investors are already in. Unlike Ethereum in its first phase, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t waiting to deliver function — it’s doing it now. Utility Comes First — and It Pays Immediately With the Solaris Nova App, mining is no longer limited to people with specialized rigs or locked capital. Anyone with a compatible smartphone can mine BTC-S using idle storage and CPU — and start earning in minutes. This is protocol-level mobile mining, not outsourced compute or simulated rewards. Returns during beta already exceeded many staking platforms. There are no hardware barriers, no staking lockups, and no technical complexity. The app is live, and it’s growing in user base as more people realize they can earn simply by participating. The protocol’s infrastructure has passed independent audit by Freshcoins , while core contracts have been verified by Cyberscope . The development team has completed full KYC verification , establishing trust ahead of launch. Analyst Coverage Confirms Early Momentum Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention for the right reasons. In a recent Crypto Vlog review , the project was praised for delivering actual results at the presale stage — a rarity in the current market. Analysts are watching early performance metrics, not just the roadmap. More importantly, users are actively engaging with the network, mining with mobile devices and earning before any centralized exchange listing. While other early projects ask investors to wait for value, Bitcoin Solaris is distributing it from the start. Supply Is Fixed, Demand Is Active, and Pricing Is Still Low Bitcoin Solaris is capped at 21 million tokens. Just 4.2 million are in the presale. No emissions. No delayed unlocks. No backdoor allocations. Supply is clean and predictable — and every token already has a function. BTC-S is used for transaction fees, for mining rewards, and inside the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — which is live and running now. Every registered user gets one free spin per day. No token required. Just log in, spin, and collect if you win. For buyers, the casino unlocks reward tiers based on purchase size. Spend $250, and you access bigger spins. Spend $2,500, and you’re in for draws worth up to 0.5 BTC. It’s fast, automatic, and designed to keep tokens circulating instead of sitting idle. The token will also power the Mining Power Marketplace, now under construction. There, users will rent and monetize excess compute power on-chain. Supply meets demand, directly — no third parties needed. Products Are Live and In Use Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising a future product — it’s already operational. The Nova App is doing what it’s supposed to. People are mining. The Casino is running every day and pushing tokens back into circulation. The Marketplace is being built now — not promised later. Wallet upgrades are on the schedule, testnet is close, and the dev suite is nearly wrapped. None of this is staged for marketing — it’s work in progress, backed by actual timelines, not placeholder graphics on a pitch deck. Bitcoin Solaris is producing returns, distributing access, and expanding adoption before most altcoins even finish their whitepapers. Price momentum is already building inside the presale. Phase 8 is open. Supply is limited. And for serious investors, this may be the last cycle where early-stage, real-utility gains are still within reach.

2025-06-22T10:32:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Already Down, Iran Attacks Send BTC Price to $102,760 – Buy the Dip?","Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped sharply as geopolitical tensions rise, down to $102,760 as risk assets sell off. The decline follows a major escalation in the Middle East where US military forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, expanding the Israel-Iran conflict. This geopolitical shock triggered immediate market reactions with investors moving into traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Bitcoin, seen as a speculative asset during times of high volatility, fell 9% from its monthly high of $111,800 to $101,053. Bitcoin sold off all day & made up more than half of its losses in the last 30 minutes. Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is at $102,777 with over $47 billion in daily volume. The risk-off tone intensified after Iranian officials condemned the strikes and threatened retaliation. Iran’s Foreign Minister called for an emergency UN meeting, while Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a situation “getting out of control”. This sent equities and digital assets into a tailspin with BTC leading the way. Bitcoin Traders Reprice Risk as Bitcoin Falls The US strikes have deepened global fears of a wider war involving Israel, the US, and Iran. As tensions rose, Israel closed its airspace, Iran threatened key military and nuclear sites in the region and media reports emerged of bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles used in the operation. Israel closes airspace after US attack on Iranian targets; land crossings with Egypt, Jordan remain open – Airports Authority https://t.co/2zHClVYd9v pic.twitter.com/csMtu5kNFC — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) June 22, 2025 While the IAEA confirmed no radiation leaks, the psychological impact was big. Fears of disruption to global trade, energy markets and long-term regional security sent traders running. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge has again been called into question as it’s behaving like a risk asset during times of global stress. Monthly Drop: ~8.93% from $111,800 to $102,438 Weekly Loss: Over 2% and still falling Market Cap: $2.04 trillion Circulating Supply: 19.88 million BTC Former President Donald Trump’s comments saying the strikes were a “big success” only added to the fears of further escalation. With diplomacy stalled and Iran warning of “consequences forever” the crypto market is uncertain. Unless the political situation stabilizes, Bitcoin will likely continue to underperform as traders reduce risk. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Still Cautionary From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish. The 2-hour chart shows price action stuck in a descending channel with lower highs and lower lows. BTC failed to retest $103,932—the 50-period EMA which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A series of small candles at $102,900 indicates indecision, but no bullish reversal patterns, such as a morning star or three white soldiers, have formed to change the trend. Momentum is weak with the MACD signal lines flatlining below zero and the histogram not recovering. BTC did briefly touch support at $101,478 before bouncing with a long lower wick, so buyers are defending that level for now. Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: At $102,900 on bearish confirmation (e.g. shooting star or bearish engulfing) Stop-Loss: Above $104,100 Target 1: $101,478 Target 2: $100,451 Until price breaks above $104,031 and out of the descending channel the short-term is bearish. Any bounce is likely corrective not a reversal. Conclusion Bitcoin’s drop to $102,760 is a sign of investors reducing risk in the Middle East chaos. With macro headwinds getting stronger and no technical confirmation of a bottom, traders should be cautious. A true “buy the dip” opportunity may require a ceasefire or a confirmed break above resistance. Best Wallet ($BEST): Crypto Storage Meets Early Access Best Wallet is emerging as a leading crypto platform, combining advanced security with seamless access to early-stage tokens. Available on Google Play and the App Store, it supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and is the first wallet to integrate Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP security protocol.

2025-06-22T10:19:45,"Analyst sets date when Bitcoin could crash to $80,000","A trading analyst has warned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could lose its $100,000 support and face deeper losses in the coming months if the bearish sentiment continues. In particular, Master Ananda’s analysis indicated that a decisive break below $100,000 could open the door to a drop toward the $88,888 and $82,500 range, he explained in a TradingView post on June 22. According to the analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels on the daily chart suggest that if Bitcoin falls through $100,000, it could quickly slide to around $88,000 at the 0.618 level, and potentially to $80,000 at the 0.786 level, areas where demand has appeared before. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView The analyst noted that a rapid selloff could follow without buyer support at these levels. Interestingly, this bearish setup depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above $100,000, which it has managed so far. If it does, a strong rebound is still the most likely outcome. The outlook also suggested that a quick drop to $80,000 would probably be short-lived before the uptrend resumes. The next two to three days will be crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin stays supported or faces further losses. If $100,000 fails, a move toward the $80,000 area might be achievable by early October. Bitcoin enters major demand zone Meanwhile, pseudonymous crypto analyst BitBull suggested in an X post on June 22 that the current bearish mood might be a healthy reset for Bitcoin. According to BitBull , Bitcoin is testing a major demand zone between $100,000 and $103,500, where whales have been actively accumulating. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: BitBull He highlighted this price range as a key area of interest, as it is a strong support floor for the cryptocurrency. Despite fears and an “everything is over” narrative in the market, the expert noted that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains solid. Technicals show this demand zone has historically been a stronghold, and Bitcoin still looks promising in a broader time frame. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,284, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours and over 3% on the weekly chart. Moving ahead, bulls need to push the price back to $103,000 to open the door for a retest of $105,000. However, if Bitcoin loses the short-term support at $102,000, a drop below $100,000 looks increasingly plausible.

2025-06-22T09:54:05,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as South Korea Green‑lights Spot ETFs","South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has officially submitted a roadmap to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025, marking a dramatic reversal of its previous ban on retail ETF products. Alongside this, the plan outlines a blueprint for a won-backed stablecoin ecosystem and enhanced exchange transparency and fee disclosures. 🚨 🇰🇷 South Korea’s Financial Services Commission submits roadmap to approve spot #crypto #ETFs in H2 2025. pic.twitter.com/bmkYDJKg8m — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) June 20, 2025 This shift could open regulated on-ramps for domestic investors who, until now, have lacked safe, compliant access to digital assets. As global markets, from the U.S. to the EU, race to embrace spot ETFs and stablecoins, South Korea’s move signals that its retail-hungry crypto sector may soon see a surge of institutional-grade products, bringing new opportunities for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. South Korea Charts Course for Spot Crypto ETFs and Won Stablecoins by Late 2025 South Korea’s financial regulator has filed plans to approve spot crypto ETFs and a local stablecoin market. This signals a major policy shift, targeting late 2025 implementation. The FSC submitted its roadmap supporting President Lee's pledge to lift the crypto ETF ban. Local investors could soon access regulated spot crypto products for the first time. Developing a Korean won-backed stablecoin ecosystem is also a key goal. Officials believe this can reduce capital flight and offer safer crypto choices domestically. The FSC stressed these plans remain tentative and unconfirmed. Yet they highlight a clear government move towards broader crypto market openness. South Korea boasts a huge retail crypto market, holding $75 billion late last year. Clear rules are vital for both local and global players. Historically strict, Korea banned most crypto investment products for regular people. President Lee's team is actively changing that stance now. This push includes proposed stablecoin rules, exchange transparency, and investor safeguards. It's part of a wider pro-crypto strategy. Regulators are advancing the next phase of their digital asset framework. This covers listings, fair fees, and tougher penalties for market cheats. Global pressure mounts as the US and EU race ahead with crypto ETFs and stablecoins. Korea feels the heat to stay competitive. This roadmap is a game-changer. Korean investors have long waited for regulated access to spot crypto ETFs and stablecoins. If implemented, it will bring Korea in line with global leaders like the US and EU, according to Simon Kim (CEO of Hashed, a Korean VC). https://t.co/6cRGX0uNgJ — Simon Kim (@simonkim_nft) June 5, 2025 If the roadmap holds, spot Bitcoin ETFs could launch here late next year. This opens doors for fresh institutional and retail money. Regulators walk a tightrope balancing innovation with necessary oversight. However, the momentum for change is clearly building strong. Korea plans close work with banks to oversee ETF transactions properly. They demand clear operations, strong reviews, and good risk tools. Alongside crypto rules, the FSC may extend stock exchange hours significantly. Stricter rules for public companies are also rolling out now. This green light shows that the nations beyond the US and the UK are getting receptive to the ETF offerings. And since the crypto talk has now seeped into regulations, chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This green light shows that nations beyond the US and the UK are becoming receptive to ETF offerings. And since crypto discussions have now seeped into regulations, the chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This is a critical time for such a recovery as well, since BTC price action has not inspired much confidence lately, especially with the market reeling under the intense geopolitical backdrop involving Iran and Israel. That being said, as far as ETF news is concerned, Cryptoquant reports that there has been an influx of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which has now reached 128,000 BTC, indicating that institutional interest has been restored. This, combined with the progressive news coming from the regulatory front, could help restore market balance. Best Crypto To Buy Now With South Korea poised to open its market to spot ETFs and homegrown stablecoins, investors may soon enjoy safer, regulated routes into digital assets. These reforms could attract fresh institutional capital and boost liquidity across the board, setting the stage for a renewed bull run.

Strong whale activity and a sharp supply reduction have made Solaxy one of the most anticipated presales of the year. Listings on major exchanges are expected soon, boosting visibility and price momentum. Renowned crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins believes Solaxy has the potential to see a 338% price increase. Due to high demand, Solaxy has extended its presale timeline, offering more investors a chance to get involved. The project remains committed to transparency, security, and sustainable growth.

Conclusion South Korea's spot ETF roadmap and stablecoin strategy supported by the won indicates a tipping point in its policy for digital assets, with regulated access and more robust investor protection promised. It is not just a demonstration of the country's search for market maturity, but also indicates a trend towards institutional adoption and more transparent crypto regulation globally.

In a new interview on CNBC, Lee says he’s watching for a point when the Fed could run into an “accident,” where it waits too long to address a slowing economy. Lee says he’s anticipating a potential “panic” scenario from the Fed. “There could be an accident because what we are ignoring is that housing is choking and collapsing under the weight of higher interest rates, and the labor market isn’t as strong as it appears. When we look at the ability to get a job, it’s much harder. So… there’s long and variable lags, and there could be an accident where the Fed would have to panic, so I think that’s something we have to watch in the incoming data… I think there could be a point where the Fed suddenly realizes the risks are actually to the downside for the economy weakening, and so the Fed will actually have to respond to an economy that they’re strangulating and really fighting what they believe is a supply shock inflation. So I’m a little concerned that the Fed could be late if they continue to hold.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This morning, Ethereum lost 7.7 percent of its value, falling to $2,200, while Bitcoin remained largely stable. Ethereum Price Dropped More Than Most Smaller Altcoins ETH recouped some of its losses during the day, reaching its lowest intraday price since May 9. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly saw $101,000 before trading close to its previous levels. Since traditional financial markets were closed over the weekend, cryptocurrencies were the first to react to the developments. “The market is watching geopolitical developments with concern,” said Caroline Moron, co-founder of crypto derivatives market liquidity provider Orbit Markets, noting that investors are keeping a close eye on levels of $100,000 for Bitcoin and $2,000 for Ethereum. Moron said oil prices will also be on the agenda when traditional markets reopen. Related News: Developers of Major Memecoin Transfer Their Holdings to Binance: They May Have Sold Uncertainty in the markets reached its peak when Trump announced that Iran’s facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan were hit. Trump, who stated that a “bomb-laden attack” was carried out on the Fordow facility in particular, stated that this facility was being closely monitored by the international community on suspicion of nuclear weapons production due to its uranium enrichment activities. “Uncertainty over whether the US will attack Iran has been creating selling pressure throughout the week,” said Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital Management. “However, confirmation of the attacks and the imminent resolution have led prices to find a local bottom.” According to Coinglass data, a total of $679 million worth of positions were liquidated in the crypto market in the last 24 hours. $554 million of this figure consisted of long positions and $67 million consisted of short positions. Jiang also noted that during times of geopolitical uncertainty, “Bitcoin usually leads the recovery.” *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Texas has become the first US state to launch a publicly funded, standalone Bitcoin reserve. Other states like Florida and Arizona have backed away from similar efforts. The move follows President Trump’s executive order to establish a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on Saturday, establishing a state-funded Bitcoin reserve, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. Texas Taps Comptroller to Oversee New Bitcoin Fund The fund will be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and aims to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset class. “We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years,” said bill author Senator Charles Schwertner earlier this year. A companion bill, HB 4488, further shields the Bitcoin reserve from being raided during the state’s routine fund reallocations and secures its legal status regardless of when, or if, Bitcoin is purchased. JUST IN: Texas Governor Greg Abbott signs Bitcoin Reserve bill SB 21 into law. Texas is now the third state with a Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/2JJOc7anf4 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 21, 2025 Despite its potentially far-reaching implications, the initiative was left out of the governor’s list of top legislative priorities. Texas’ move comes as some US states abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. She called digital assets “untested investments,” effectively stopping the proposed Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Act in its tracks. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Public Companies Embrace Bitcoin as Strategic Investment Meanwhile, public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

Market participants reacted swiftly to the dip, which pushed BTC near the bottom of its month-long trading range. The reversal gained momentum as volume accelerated, leading to a strong rebound. The move coincided with a sharply worded post from James Lavish, a Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, who wrote on X : “If you are selling Bitcoin because of the possibility of the world going to war, you have absolutely no idea what you own.” The $100K–$110K range has contained price movement for nearly a month. On-chain metrics suggest a balanced market with neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation, while derivatives data indicates cautious sentiment with continued demand for downside protection. Technical Analysis Highlights A midnight push lifted BTC above $102,800 with trading volume peaking at 17,906 BTC. Between 05:57 and 06:00, BTC climbed from $102,767 to $102,912, supported by volume spikes over 150 BTC per minute. Peak recovery-period volume hit 184.24 BTC, helping drive price toward $102,990. Minute-level consolidation around $102,680–$102,720 preceded the breakout. A higher support level began forming near $102,870 as volatility decreased.

The move, announced by former President Donald Trump, saw bombers hit Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — three of Iran’s main uranium enrichment facilities. The geopolitical jolt rattled global markets and sent crypto into a tailspin on Sunday. In the past 24 hours, 172,853 traders were liquidated, with total losses hitting $681.8 million, meaning 87% of it was from longs. Ether (ETH) traders took the biggest hit with $282 million in liquidations, followed by bitcoin (BTC) tracked trades at $151 million.Futures tracking other majors, such as SOL, XRP, and DOGE also faced heavy losses, with at least over $22 million in losses.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Prices briefly plunged before stabilizing. Bitcoin held near $102,000, while Ethereum traded just above $2,280, both down intraday but avoiding freefall.

2025-06-22T07:14:07,"Trump told Iran to “make peace” after bombing three of its nuclear sites","Trump went on national television Saturday night and demanded that Iran “make peace,” just two hours after the US military bombed three major Iranian nuclear sites. Speaking from the White House, Trump said any future strikes would be “far greater and a lot easier” if Iran retaliated. He gave no details about what kind of peace he expects or what Tehran would need to do. But the threat was clear: stop now, or get hit harder. According to reporting from Tasnim and other official statements, Iran didn’t wait long to respond, it launched missiles at Israel, officially escalating the fight. Trump had spent weeks saying he wanted a nuclear deal with Iran, even after Israel’s initial attack. He claimed Iran was open to it. But by Tuesday, his tone changed. First, he told reporters he didn’t want a ceasefire—he wanted “an end, a real end.” Hours later, on Truth Social, he posted “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in all caps. Two days later, he gave himself a two-week deadline to decide whether to launch a strike. He said there was still a “substantial chance” for diplomacy. By Saturday night, that chance was gone. US jets hit Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites, pulling American forces into another war in the Middle East. Crypto bounces after modest drop Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies dropped fast when the attack news hit. Within minutes, Bitcoin fell below $100,000, SOL hit $121, Ether dropped to $2,300, and XRP touched $2.09. But two hours later, prices had bounced back. Bitcoin was back above 102k, SOL rose over 130, and Ether and XRP held steady. The crypto market’s reaction was fast, chaotic, and short-lived. Investors didn’t wait to panic though at all. They bought the dip and moved on. Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry called Trump’s strikes a “dangerous war against Iran.” In a statement carried by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, the government said the US had “betrayed diplomacy” and described Israel as “genocidal and lawless.” It said Trump’s actions violated international law and the UN Charter and warned of “grave consequences and dire repercussions.” They also said it was Iran’s “legitimate right to fully and resolutely resist” and defend its national interests “by all necessary means.” Iran called on the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency to respond immediately. The government asked the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. The statement urged international bodies to condemn what it called “a flagrant and criminal act of illegality.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But that’s exactly what Jetking, a name once known for making radios and televisions in India, has done. The company, which later moved into IT education, faced tough times during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world shut down, Jetking’s 200 centers across India saw business dry up. Forced to rethink their future, the leadership explored around 15 different ideas to revive the company. In the end, they made a big move: to transform into a Bitcoin-centric company. In an interview with Coinpedia, CFO Siddarth Bharwani said, “Jetking’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset has had both symbolic and financial implications, The move sparked interest from a new class of investors, particularly younger or tech-savvy retail investors.” The company is aiming to hold 210 Bitcoins by the end of 2025. Navigating India’s 30% Crypto Tax India’s strict 30% tax on crypto profits hasn’t made things easy. But Jetking has taken a different route. “We follow a ‘Never Sell Bitcoin’ strategy,” Bharwani explained. This means the company doesn’t realize profits on its Bitcoin holdings, avoiding taxable events. Any changes in value are simply noted as revaluation reserves in the financial reports. Handling RBI’s Crypto Concerns The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has repeatedly raised concerns about crypto being used for illegal cross-border transfers, like hawala. Jetking says it takes these worries seriously and uses a compliance-first approach. All Bitcoin is bought via regulated, FIU-registered exchanges and stored with institutional-grade custodians that follow KYC and AML checks. Hopes for Better Crypto Laws in India As India works on a formal set of crypto rules, Jetking hopes for fairer regulations. The company supports government oversight but wants a shift from the flat 30% tax to a graded capital gains model based on how long crypto is held. “We expect shift from a flat 30% tax on gains to a graded capital gains tax model based on holding period. Enable carry-forward and offset of losses, as is the case with other financial assets and GST exemption or clarity when crypto is used purely as a treasury reserve, not as payment or service,” they said.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/exclusive-how-a-77-year-old-indian-brand-is-betting-big-on-bitcoin-despite-tough-taxes/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 66,600 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be mirroring gold’s 2024 price action, when the precious metal struggled to clear resistance at $2,100 for multiple weeks before sparking a huge upside burst. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is likely consolidating below $110,000 to set the stage for a breakout and a parabolic rally to new all-time high prices. “Look at the $2,000-ish level [of gold]. This is the kind of asset we are now. If you expect anything else other than this, I think you’re just wrong… You see that breakout level that got tested four times, and you [had] false breakouts… I mean [gold] didn’t move for the longest time, and then it just went up only forever, which is kind of nuts to observe. But basically, I feel we’re that asset now, where you’re going to flirt with the same level like three or four times and people are going to lose all their money before it breaks out.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, gold is worth $3,368 while Bitcoin is trading for $102,114.

Here’s the Timeline","A new post from well-known crypto commentator Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) has stirred conversation around the long-term outlook for XRP, pointing to a bullish macro structure that, according to him, remains overlooked due to the market’s narrow focus on Bitcoin. The comment came in response to a chart shared by another analyst, which displayed a clear symmetrical triangle formation on the asset’s monthly chart. Cobb took the discussion further, declaring that XRP possesses “one of the most beautifully painted bullish macro charts in all of crypto.” XRP has one of the most beautifully painted bullish macro charts in all of crypto Market is way too tunnel visioned on Bitcoin to understand this The facemelting/sideline tears are going to be of epic proportions end of 2025 https://t.co/UNdh9qZAot — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 20, 2025 A Macro View Being Ignored Cobb emphasized that market participants are largely dismissing XRP’s structure due to what he described as “tunnel-visioned” attention on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has long held dominance in the market, Cobb believes that this bias is obscuring more technically significant setups forming in altcoins, such as XRP. The chart shows XRP’s pronounced upward move from late 2024, followed by the months of consolidation. This consolidation phase formed a symmetrical triangle, supporting Cobb’s interpretation of a developing breakout scenario. Other analysts have suggested that XRP is at the end of this consolidation phase and expect a breakout soon. If the breakout occurs, this structure suggests that XRP could continue its previous rally, targeting higher levels this time. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 End-of-Year Expectations Importantly, Cobb attached a timeline to his forecast. He expects the implications of this chart to materialize toward the end of 2025, a period he believes will produce “face-melting/sideline tears… of epic proportions.” Experts have predicted targets as high as $10 for the end of 2025. Historically, macro consolidation patterns such as symmetrical triangles often resolve with trend continuation. The XRP monthly chart highlighting this pattern aligns with that classical setup. Recognizing XRP’s Potential Despite the clarity Cobb sees in the chart, broader market attention remains centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cobb suggests that many will be caught off guard if XRP follows through on the technical setup now in play. A swift rise will price out many investors , but those who can see the asset’s potential will benefit significantly when the price starts climbing. XRP is in a unique position, as Bitcoin maximalists are now recognizing its potential. Davinci Jeremie, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently predicted that XRP will reach $24 by the end of 2025 , demonstrating that even its biggest detractors cannot detract from its true value.

Experts Warn of a Possible $1.55 Test appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP is showing signs of weakness despite recently climbing above a descending trendline that had capped every rally since February. After slipping back under key resistance levels, analysts now warn that XRP could be at risk of a deeper pullback in the coming sessions. At the time of writing, XRP is struggling to hold support around $2.10, having dipped as low as $2.03. Analyst CasiTrades warns that while XRP briefly reclaimed its breakout level, the move could be a false breakout. She added that if open interest begins to rise without a meaningful price move, particularly if it crosses 0.02% or higher — it could signal a high probability of a liquidity sweep to the downside. “If we fail to hold $2.25, it puts $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55 in play,” she explained. A capitulation move toward these lower levels, while painful in the short term, could generate the exact momentum XRP needs to finally break free of its multi-year range. CasiTrades said such a shakeout could pave the way for a powerful Wave 3 breakout in the coming weeks. Technical indicators support the bearish short-term outlook. RSI and Stochastic indicators on the daily and 4-hour charts are showing oversold conditions, hinting at continued selling pressure before a possible rebound. The market is currently watching the $1.95–$1.88 zone closely for signs of stabilization. Adding to the uncertainty, XRP’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. As both major cryptocurrencies trade within tight ranges and show signs of a potential pullback, altcoins like XRP are likely to mirror this behavior. While short-term risks remain high, some analysts remain positive about XRP’s medium-term prospects. If the market can shake off current bearish sentiment, XRP could recover towards $2.25–$2.35 initially, with more ambitious targets of $3 by the end of July if bullish momentum builds.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-crash-25-experts-warn-of-a-possible-1-55-test/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

At press time, shares of the Yes side of the Polymarket-listed contract ""Will Iran Close the Strait of Hormuz before June 30 traded at 40 cents, representing a 40% probability. That's a notable increase from 14% Saturday. Meanwhile, the odds of the event occurring by the end of the year increased to 52%, up from 33% the previous day. Approximately 20 million barrels of oil are transported through the Strait of Hormuz daily, accounting for around 20% of the world's oil consumption, according to the Middle East Forum Observer . Therefore, the potential closure of the Hormuz could trigger a sustained oil price shock. According to JPMorgan's analysts , shutting the Strait of Hormuz could catapult crude oil prices to an eye-popping $120 to $130 per barrel. Such a spike in oil prices, coupled with the ongoing trade war, could lead to stagflation – the worst outcome for financial assets, including cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-22T04:44:48,"Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will hit $21M by 2046","Strategy founder Michael Saylor predicts that Bitcoin will hit $21 million in the next 21 years. In a Saturday X post , he commented, “$21 million in 21 years.” However, he noted that getting to $21 million per BTC may be fraught with significant price swings given the token’s high volatility. Saylor says the recent geopolitical and regulatory developments influenced his BTC expectations In his previous statements, he argued on the significance of the number “21,” noting its connection to Bitcoin’s total supply and now its projected $21 million price point. He strongly believes the asset will reach his target by 2046. Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 event on Saturday, he affirmed that this could be the one time in Bitcoin’s timeline when a 21-year outlook aligns with a $21 million valuation. His new projection is a significant step-up from his previous prediction at the 2024 Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where he stated Bitcoin would reach $13 million by 2045 . He asserted that his heightened bullish outlook on Bitcoin was shaped by recent developments in geopolitics, regulation, and adoption—none of which, he noted, were anticipated a year ago. Saylor claimed he did not expect the White House to embrace and advocate for Bitcoin, acknowledging that Donald Trump’s presidential victory marked a huge political turning point last November. He pointed out that while there was optimism about having a pro-Bitcoin leader, they did not think they would get a strategic BTC reserve, or a President who’s set to make the country the Bitcoin superpower of the world. He also touched on the new regulatory and legislative developments around crypto, including the stablecoin-focused Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act, adding that no one could have guessed that states would embrace BTC. While he remains bullish that BTC will soon reach $21 million, he also predicts a volatile ride for the token. He, however, forecasts the fluctuations to eventually level out, projecting a solid 21% CAGR over time. He added that the token could very well continue to surpass the S&P 500 each year till 2046. Saylor has never disclosed where Strategy’s BTC holdings are Aside from Saylor’s bullish prediction, his company, Strategy, has maintained its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, adding another $1 billion in BTC last week. The company held about 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025, but it has not disclosed how and where it stores its holdings. Saylor was very vocal about his disapproval of the concept of proof-of-reserves. Speaking at the May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, he argued that PoR dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. Last year, Saylor also rejected the concept of self-custody, contradicting many Bitcoin holders. After receiving much criticism from the crypto community for encouraging the use of banks rather than self-custody, he shifted to voicing support for the method for individuals who are “willing and able.” At the BTC Prague event, many attendees seemed drawn to the idea of self-custody, citing “be your own bank” principles. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at the hardware wallet company, Trezor, even confirmed that the event attendees included “a vibrant mix of developers, Bitcoiners, and newcomers — all genuinely interested in open-source tools and the principles of self-custody.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-22T03:22:07,"BNB Chain Weathers Turbulent Week Amid Altcoin Meltdown","The BNB Chain ecosystem has endured a stormy week, shedding $12.4 billion in market capitalization amid a broader altcoin crash that rippled across the digital asset space. While flagship assets such as Bitcoin slipped below the $104,000 mark, the BNB Chain’s performance mirrored the market downturn with a 7% drop in value. BNB itself fell 4.5%, closing the week just under $640. On-chain diagnosis of the state of affairs was not encouraging. Total value locked (TVL) in the BNB Chain ecosystem took a 5% hit. The major DeFi platforms—which include Venus and PancakeSwap—suffered big losses. The situation was not helped by falling trading volumes on DeFi exchanges and across the board; stablecoin transactions, which had been a bright spot, also declined. Overall, there has been a notable drop in engagement on-chain and in movement of capital across the BNB Chain. It is interesting to note that the daily active addresses on BNB Chain increased by 5%. This percentage increase suggests that despite the selloff, and reduced trading activity, users of BNB Chain are continuing to interact with applications on that network. In fact, this uptick in user activity, even with the market heading downward, says a lot about BNB Chain—and not just in terms of its solvency. Tokens Tumble, But Some Defy Gravity The week saw severe losses for most BEP-20 tokens on the BNB Chain. Among them, KOGE took one of the sharpest falls, plummeting down to 51.1%. ROAM wasn’t too far behind, with a decline of 40.4%; MYTH, with 38.2% down, closely followed. These altcoin losses are a function of the segment’s overall volatility and risk sensitivity. Investors seem to be pulling capital from the smaller, emerging tokens that for them provide little cover in the face of a dip like this. Altcoins can be more easily and dramatically affected by market movement because they are either illiquid or insufficiently capitalized. Altcoins are also the tokens most likely to get the rug pulled on them. A handful of tokens managed to log some gains, even with the market feeling negative. AB surged 31.5% because of something we don’t usually get a chance to talk about, the kind of increased visibility that comes with being featured on Binance Alpha. ALT logged a nice 23.9% bump, thanks to its new role in the BNB Kickstart program, which aims to help serve and shine a light on new projects in the crypto space that really seem to have something special going on. ORBS was another token that took the opportunity of this clearly defined market to power up a 15.5% gain. And standing out was clearly the way to go, as that was the only way to be noticed in a mostly negative space. These tokens’ performance demonstrates that, although the broader market was facing difficulty, some projects were still managing to preserve or even enhance their value. The kinds of projects that thrived in this context seemed to have either institutional or programmatic backing. Week in BNB Chain: Sector Weakens During Altcoin Market Meltdown. BNB Chain sheds $12.4B! BTC drops Let’s break down how BNB Chain weathered the storm 1/6 pic.twitter.com/9Tjmn0azSj — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 19, 2025 Ecosystem Developments Point to Long-Term Growth In the middle of market ups and downs, the BNB Chain kept its eyes on the prize: the expansion and betterment of its ecosystem. Last week, the BNB Chain Incentive Fund, worth $100 million, made 17 fresh token buys, still on that same mission to help pay for the sort of innovation that will, ideally, also pay off in the sort of growth that we hope accompanies the kinds of not-so-promising projects we find on some networks. One significant change occurred when the complete migration of KOM from Polygon and Arbitrum to the BNB Chain was realized. This represented not just an appeasement of KOM to a new ecosystem, but a corroboration from developers of the BNB Chain’s infrastructure, scalability, and support systems. It could be that projects migrating are finding new advantages in the environments they are moving to. Then again, it could be that BNB Chain is simply the next place to be for projects looking to establish a strong community. Migration seems to be the word of the day. At the same time, MCPForge experienced an enhancement in its designation within the BNB Hack program, which underscores the ecosystem’s excitement about rewarding and recognizing technical brilliance. Also, SwissBorg implemented BNB Chain into its cross-chain functionality, allowing smooth token swapping between various blockchain networks and further interpolating BNB Chain into the global crypto scene. These initiatives in the ecosystem signal to us that BNB Chain is not standing idle in the current climate of market pressure. It is purposeful. It is investing. And not just in what it already has. It is expanding its very nascent infrastructure (it must be real if it’s called the ‘infrastructure fund’), growing the developer ecosystem with the recent hackathon, and also—this is key—we mustn’t skip over—it is deepening and widening its cross-chain work nowadays. Looking Ahead Even with BNB Chain losing billions in value alongside the broader altcoin market, the network sees very encouraging user activity as well as strategic and smart growth around its ecosystem that makes it look like it has some underlying strength. And you know, I think it’d be good to put a bit of context around BNB Chain here too, since it is a bit of a tricky case for certain folks. So, first, the user base: it puts BNB Chain at almost over 200 million users across its ecosystem. While the crypto markets keep moving up and down, the long-term strength of chains such as BNB may depend on how well they can keep user engagement and draw in novel projects.

2025-06-22T03:19:17,"Tensions Rise Between Trump and Powell as Markets Await Interest Rate Cuts","The U.S . monetary policy is now under some very vocal pressures. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the way monetary policy is now being conducted, and in no uncertain terms told his followers on Truth Social that Powell is a “disaster” and that “inflation is going to kill our economy”—and that he’s disappointed they’re now holding rates steady and not cutting them like he apparently thinks they should. What are the potential impacts of all this on not just the stock market but also cryptocurrencies and the wider economy? At the center of the controversy is the well-known clash of interests: Trump’s aggressive preference for rate cuts to juice the economy versus Powell’s umpteenth reiteration of the Fed’s dual mandate—ensure stable prices and maximum employment. With the electoral drama of 2024 out of the way, we’re likely to be in a more volatile 2025 financial landscape. The priorities of elected officials and those of the independent central bank will likely be more at odds than ever—and likely a much bigger story than Trump still being very much in the picture. More Publicly Traded Companies Now Hold BTC In the first half of 2025, the number of publicly traded companies holding #Bitcoin has tripled compared to 2024. This surge is driven by increasingly crypto-friendly regulations in the U.S., which are encouraging corporate adoption of… pic.twitter.com/961ai5gLtP — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 19, 2025 Market Correction Highlights Growing Pressure The ongoing rate stalemate has evoked a cautious retreat in the markets. As of now, Bitcoin trades at a distance of 6.8% from its all-time high of $64,000 reached on May 22, 2021. Similarly, the S&P 500 stands at a 2.6% deficit from its record peak of $3,386 reached on February 19, 2021. These figures represent a modest downward correction for both assets, but they shine a light on the current state of investor confidence in both the Fed’s next move and the broader macroeconomic recovery. With Trump expressing his disappointment in Jerome Powell & the FOMC leaving interest rates unchanged, social media has erupted with discussions. Crypto, like global stock markets, stand to benefit if and when rate cuts happen again. Currently, Bitcoin is -6.8% below its… pic.twitter.com/PTM1nAVx1W — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 In the past, lower interest rates have benefitted stocks and crypto assets because they mean cheaper borrowing costs, which translates into greater liquidity and risk appetite. Some traders and analysts see the potential for rate cuts as a bullish catalyst across the board. But rate cuts could be an even better catalyst for crypto, given that the market’s tendency to respond sharply to shifts in monetary policy. Trump sees a link between his popularity and the Fed’s interest rate policies. When consumers and businesses are confident, the economy hums along. When that happens, the president tends to look good, at least if he’s up for re-election the next year. But Powell has so far resisted this pressure, maintaining that any future rate moves will be guided by economic data—particularly inflation indicators—rather than political will. This confrontation lays the groundwork for a strained standoff between the president and the Fed, with ripple effects almost sure to be felt in global markets. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings See Massive Growth Though rate policy usually gets the most attention, a much quieter but equally significant transformation is taking place within the crypto universe. The number of publicly traded firms that now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets has tripled, from 10 to 30, over the last year. Why are so many more companies now jumping into the deep end of crypto, and what does it mean for the future? More favorable regulation in the U.S. has set the stage for greater corporate adoption of crypto. Moves in Congress lately have clarified how crypto is taxed, set up some investor protections, and basically streamlined the regulatory environment for crypto, which makes it a whole lot easier for companies to hold and manage Bitcoin. Next, rising geopolitical instability—from trade confrontations to shooting wars—has renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a bulwark against uncertainty. Increasingly, many companies view BTC not just as a bet-it-all-in Vegas kind of play but instead as something more analogous to a strategic reserve that also happens to be digital gold. In times of market turbulence or currency convulsions, Bitcoin’s decentralization and global appeal have never looked more attractive to company treasurers looking for more ways to diversify. Significantly, well-known companies in various fields—including technology, energy, and finance—have jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon, which suggests that the cryptocurrency’s standing in the corporate world is improving. No longer considered a fringe experiment, Bitcoin is now part of the fundamental corporate strategy in many high-profile companies. Policy Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Sentiment The Trump administration and the Federal Reserve are creating a crypto narrative. We have a possible short-term upside event for not just Bitcoin but for all digital assets, which is that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Lowering rates would be bad for the dollar. But it might not even be that bad for the dollar, because it would be lowering the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t pay interest, like Bitcoin. So it’s possible that if the Fed cuts rates, and in the context of broader questions about the federal government’s fiscal policy, we could see the dollar weaken, and that is going to be good for all these assets. Powell and Trump’s stimulus vision in a push-pull market. Powell insists on making data-driven decisions. Trump, on the other hand, pushes for a very proactive kind of stimulus. You have market actors trying to make sense of this and price it in. And they’re having a hell of a time doing it. Why? Because what we’re talking about here is the inner dynamics of inflation. At the same time, the increasingly broad institutional acceptance of Bitcoin provides another fresh layer of support for the cryptocurrency market. That could help soften any downward momentum that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have during poor macroeconomic conditions. And it reinforces the notion that those cryptocurrencies could indeed be viable long-term investments. Once we reach the midpoint of 2025, the Fed’s next move will be the focus of attention, what with a presidential election having just taken place. And right now, we can only guess how the political-economic tug-of-war that is shaping the U.S. Congress might affect the future of both traditional markets and digital assets.

2025-06-22T03:11:54,"Bitcoin’s Diverging Wallet Activity Hints at Potential Bullish Reversal Amid Market Volatility","Currently, Bitcoin has a market cap a bit over $104,300. The entire wallet activity across the Bitcoin system seems to tell a story of very divergence accumulation behavior between the types of investors. On one side, we have the big institutional investors, who look to be quietly accumulating even more Bitcoin. And on the other side, we have some retail investors—well, a seemingly shrinking group of them—who look to be bailing out of the system once and for all. Whales Accumulate While Retail Flees A recent influx of blockchain data paints an increasingly clear picture of a market dynamic in flux. In the latest 10-day timeframe, the quantity of Bitcoin wallets stacked high enough to hold 10 BTC or more—that is to say, wallets that could accurately be described as “whale” wallets—has gone up by 231. That’s not a huge number, but it’s an uptick. And in the world of crypto, any kind of uptick is something to write home about. Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K. Wallets with 10+ $BTC : +231 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) Wallets with 0.001 to 10 $BTC : -37,465 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) When large wallets… pic.twitter.com/uhZf6rPYvq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 Retail-level wallets—those containing between 0.001 BTC and 10 BTC—are down a net 37,465 over the same period. This reflects increasing hesitance or submission to the market among the smaller holder demographic, a phenomenon we often associate with fear or uncertainty when the market is not trending positively. This type of divergence has frequently come before bullish market reversals. When the small fish leave while the big fish are busy gathering more and more shares, that can signal a phase of stealth accumulation that soon flips into an uptrend. The current market cycle has large holders accumulating while the small fry exit. Open Interest Points to Potential Volatility Although wallet activity provides some insight into how investors feel about a project, data from the derivatives market adds a whole other dimension to the analysis—especially open interest, the total value of active futures contracts that investors have with one another. As of now, the change in open interest measures -3.5%. This slight figure in the outflow of leveraged positions shows investors still have some faith in the current Bitcoin price level. This is because a number of traders are written off as de-risking or taking profits when we see drawdowns like this happening with the open interest. It could also be seen as traders taking a little Bitcoin off the exchange and putting it back in cold storage. GM. In 2024–2025, deep open interest drawdowns –20–25% were accompanied by local BTC price corrections in the range of 7–21%. Currently, the OI change is –3.5%, which indicates a moderate outflow of positions. In case of a repeated OI decline to levels of –20%, a Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/BcIGZkM0EZ — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 20, 2025 While we’re a long way from those extremes today, analysts are warning that if OI were to renew its plunge to –20% levels, we could be looking at a much sharper BTC correction—likely in the 5–15% range. OI is currently not in crisis, and therefore, we should not be in crisis either. But what is OI? What makes it potentially good or bad? And where, for now, does it reside on the good/bad spectrum? The moderate OI movement suggests that present market players are at best tentatively positioned. It seems that they are quite possibly waiting for a macro signal or an on-chain catalyst that is not forthcoming to drive the next significant market move. A Tale of Two Markets: Sentiment vs Strategy Data is shedding light on a burgeoning disparity between sentiment and strategy in the Bitcoin market. Retail investors seem a bit spooked—possibly swayed by the spell of recent volatility, current macroeconomic uncertainty, or just good old profit-taking after a super strong multi-month rally. The drop-off in activity from small wallets makes our ‘holdco’ in the Bitcoin market look less and less like a coiled spring ready to pop up and more like an average Joe just holding on for dear life. At the same time, institutional-sized investors and whale wallets are steadily increasing their positions. This kind of accumulation usually reveals a long-term, steadfast belief in the value of Bitcoin that goes far beyond the short-term price moves we see all the time. What is seen on the surface is panic, while deeper levels show positioning for the next rally. Market veterans have seen this pattern many times before. The split is not only significant; it is also meaningful. Big investors tend to stock up during the quiet times when main-street investors are absent. They are less concerned with short-term twists and turns—they think of those as “wash trades”—and more about taking a position when they think the price is right. Conclusion As Bitcoin steadies and stays above the price of $104,000, we could be witnessing in real-time what might be playing out a lot farther down the road. The tussle between elite wallets and retail wallets could be a prelude to something much more—if not for price, then for the nature of Bitcoin itself. Elites and retail are in direct conflict when it comes to the accumulation and distribution of Bitcoin. That is a hell of a lot more to be concerned about than price. A significant drop in open interest could mean another bearish episode for Bitcoin. But not all is bad. If we maintain the status quo and whale accumulation continues, once confidence floods back into the market, we could be poised for another leg up. In the Bitcoin universe, the hushed actions of major participants frequently make the most noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.
