2025-06-22T19:49:09,"Major Development Occurs for Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX","FTX Recovery Trust, which is managing the liquidation process of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has filed a formal 94-page objection in the US Delaware bankruptcy court seeking to completely dismiss the over $1.5 billion claim by failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The appeal states that 3AC’s claim is “unrealistic, unsupportable, and based on an erroneous assumption regarding the account balance.” FTX argues that 3AC overstates the value of its digital assets. 3AC’s claim is based on FTX’s alleged holding of approximately $1.6 billion worth of digital assets on the platform when it went bankrupt in November 2022. However, as of June 2022, that account was worth only $284 million, including margin debt of more than $733 million, according to FTX’s statement. Related News: Bitcoin Price Below $100,000: Research Firm's Head of Research Reveals Next Support Level FTX alleged that 3AC ignored the debt burden and attempted to make its overly leveraged positions appear as “clean value.” According to the filing, most of that $284 million in assets disappeared in just two days. $222 million was wiped out by the crypto market crash, while $60 million was withdrawn by 3AC itself. FTX said they only liquidated one $82 million position after 3AC exceeded limits by not responding to margin calls. It claims this action was in accordance with the contract and “prevented a negative account balance.” The petition stated: “FTX creditors should not be insured against 3AC’s failed trades. The hedge fund took risky positions and messed it up. FTX took action as those positions collapsed.” If the court rules in FTX’s favor, 3AC’s claim could be dismissed entirely or significantly reduced to just ordinary creditor status, meaning the fund would only receive a small portion of the amount it is seeking. The next hearing will be held on August 12. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-22T19:22:00,"3 Best XRP Alternatives That Could 20-50x Your Portfolio In The Second Half Of 2025","The crypto market never sleeps; it evolves. While XRP remains a heavyweight in digital payments, forward-thinking investors are scanning the horizon for the next big opportunities. With cross-border transactions expected to balloon past $250 trillion within two years, fresh solutions are emerging that could leave even established players in the dust. Three projects – SUI, HYPE, and Remittix – are turning heads, each carving out distinct niches that might just deliver life-changing returns. What makes these alternatives special? They’re not just chasing XRP’s tail. Instead, they’re solving real problems in ways that could redefine entire sectors. As we approach mid-2025, these contenders offer exposure to growth vectors XRP simply can’t match, especially in the exploding PayFi space. SUI Network: Where Web3 meets Wall Street SUI isn’t just another blockchain, but Web3 built for scale. While XRP courts banks, SUI is rewriting the rulebook for decentralized applications. Recent moves have traders buzzing: a liquidity-boosting alliance between Momentum, Wormhole, and OKX has set the stage for what could be a major price surge. (ChatGPT’s bullish forecast didn’t hurt either.) Source: CoinGecko Here’s the kicker—SUI’s architecture solves the “blockchain trilemma” better than most. Fast transactions? Check. Ironclad security? You bet. And unlike XRP’s narrow focus, SUI plays well across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions. As institutions warm to Web3, this could be the infrastructure play that delivers triple-digit gains. Could HYPE ride Bitcoin’s coattails to the moon? Ever wish you’d bought Bitcoin in 2012? HYPE might be the next best thing. Whispers of massive BTC holdings by 2027 have speculators salivating. While XRP fights regulatory battles, HYPE is positioning itself as the institutional darling, labelled the “safe” crypto bet for Wall Street money. Source: CoinMarketCap The numbers tell the story: a projected $109 billion holding shift could send shockwaves through the market. Sure, it’s speculative. But remember, every crypto giant was once an underdog. HYPE’s secret sauce? It’s not trying to replace traditional finance like XRP. Instead, it’s becoming the bridge big money can’t ignore. Remittix: The silent killer of cross-border payments Let’s be honest, wire transfers are still stuck in the Stone Age. Remittix changes everything. Imagine sending crypto that lands as fiat in any bank account, with the recipient none the wiser. That’s not the future, either; it’s happening now across 40+ cryptocurrencies. While XRP battles SWIFT, Remittix sidesteps the fight entirely. Its Pay API lets businesses accept crypto while getting paid in dollars, with no volatility headaches. The real genius? Merchant accounts with 30+ fiat and 50+ crypto pairs. This isn’t just another payment rail—it’s the missing link between crypto’s speed and traditional finance’s reach. The presale is no slouch either, and tokens are flying off the shelves. Over $15.8 million has been raised to date, and with an entry price of $0.0781, early birds are locking on to this project en masse. Which XRP alternative works out best? XRP had its moment. SUI offers the tech stack for Web3’s next chapter. HYPE could be institutional money’s backdoor into crypto. But Remittix ? It’s solving the trillion-dollar pain point nobody else has cracked. The presale window won’t stay open forever. For investors who spotted Ethereum’s potential in 2016 or Solana’s in 2020, this feels eerily familiar. The question isn’t whether these alternatives will grow—it’s which one will leave XRP looking like yesterday’s news.

2025-06-22T19:05:47,"Bitcoin fell to $98K after Iran moved to shut the Strait of Hormuz","Bitcoin dropped under $99,000 on Sunday after Iran moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off one of the world’s main oil transport routes. The decision followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating an already tense situation. The impact was immediate. Ethereum collapsed by 10%, trading at $2,180, while XRP slid by 8%, landing at $1.93. The total market reacted with sharp volume spikes, liquidations, and uncertainty that’s not going away anytime soon. The Strait of Hormuz, which sits between Iran and Oman, handles a quarter of global oil exports. Iran’s parliament, reacting to the U.S. military action, backed a proposal to block the channel. Source: Axios The parliament doesn’t control the Strait, that power belongs to the military and security forces, but the threat was still enough to shake global markets. ClearView Energy Partners warned that oil prices could open “meaningfully above” the $77.01 per barrel Friday close unless the U.S. and its allies make diplomatic moves. Crypto tanks across the board as Iran stirs oil chaos According to Reuters, the shutdown announcement came after the U.S. bombed several of Iran’s nuclear sites, triggering one of the strongest reactions yet in the long-running standoff between Iran and Israel . If this plays out, it’ll be the first time the conflict actually affects global oil flows. The crypto market took it hard. In the last 24 hours alone, Bitcoin saw $47.7 billion in volume as traders moved fast. The coin is now down 6.3% this week, with its market cap at $1.96 trillion. Ethereum, which was already struggling, is now down 14.3% over 7 days, with $29.5 billion in daily volume. XRP, hit by both the geopolitical shock and its usual regulatory baggage, is down 10.7% on the week with a $114 billion market cap. Solana, sitting at $128.65, fell 6.4%, dragging its weekly losses to nearly 15%. BNB didn’t escape either, shedding 3.9%, down to $608. Only Tether held firm to its dollar peg at $1.00, with over $76 billion in 24-hour trade. Even with no actual movement to seal off the channel yet, analysts aren’t brushing this off. Eurasia Group said Sunday that Iran likely won’t fully close Hormuz, but they expect “increased harassment of tanker traffic” in the coming days. That alone is enough to cause oil panic — and oil panic is now crypto panic. Arthur Hayes, economist and crypto veteran, reacted with one line: “Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” U.S. officials call the move suicidal, warn of military response Despite the panic, the authority to block Hormuz isn’t up to Iran’s parliament. Security decisions go through the Revolutionary Guard, which hasn’t yet acted. Still, the threat alone has put pressure on Washington and raised the risk of a military showdown. Eurasia analyst Gregory Brew said that closing the Strait “would be an effective declaration of war against the Gulf states and the US.” He also noted that Iran, already weakened economically, is “unlikely to seek escalation of that kind at this time.” But there’s still tension. The U.S. has deployed major forces to the Gulf region, and any move from Iran could lead to an armed response. For crypto investors, that’s not a good sign. As long as oil routes are in danger, markets won’t stabilize. Crypto isn’t disconnected anymore. It’s tied directly to global energy routes. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also weighed in during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press . “Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz. If they want to destroy their own economy and cause disruptions in the world, I think that would be their decision,” he said. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s fall is the worst it’s seen this quarter, and Bitcoin’s slip below $100K wipes out weeks of gains. XRP, already on shaky ground due to legal fights in the U.S., is now down 6% in a day, with a full 10.7% loss over 7 days. Market caps are crumbling, and the fear is showing in trade volume spikes. Right now, the only certainty is that nothing is certain. Crypto, oil, and geopolitics are locked in the same room, and Iran just turned off the lights. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-22T19:00:25,"$96k Or $144k? Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Chart Price Target Options","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a slight uptick in the last few hours after US President Donald Trump announced a successful airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move aimed at de-escalating rising tensions in the Middle East after several days of conflict between Iran and Israel. Despite the short-term price reaction, BTC remains in a corrective phase, having struggled to break through the $110,000 resistance level over the past month with market sentiment being largely shaped by both global uncertainty and technical stagnation. Amid this backdrop, a crypto analyst with X pseudonym On-Chain College has highlighted two prospective price targets based on on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Market Odds Favor Further Upside For Bitcoin – Analyst In a recent X post on June 21, On-Chain College shares a positive long-term Bitcoin price outlook using the Mayer Multiple, an on-chain metric that measures relationship between Bitcoin’s price and its 200-day moving average (200DMA). By tracking key valuation bands, the Mayer Multiple helps determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued, based on historical price behavior. Since the bull market commenced in Q4 2024, Bitcoin has consistently moved between 1.0x band i.e. the 200DMA (blue line) and the 1.5x band (orange line) representing the mid price range zone. Notably, the Bitcoin price struggles in the past have generated speculations of potential market top at the current market high. However, the Mayer Multiple chart shows that BTC has only ever attained a cycle price peak after hitting the 2.5x band (red line). Therefore, there is still room for price growth in the current bull market. However, the immediate price targets for premier cryptocurrency lies at $96,000 (1.0x) or $144,000 (1.5x). Notably, there is significant potential to rediscover its bullish form and surge towards $144,000 in line with its defined-range bound movement. However, there are also equal chances of a return to $96,000 which On-Chain College states would aid in flushing out weak hands before a full-scale bullish price reversal. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 — Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm Bitcoin Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $102,700 following a 1.50% decline in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency also reports losses of 2.94% and 8.08% on the weekly and monthly chart, respectively. According to CoinCodex, the general market sentiment remains neutral. However, CoinCodex analysts foresee an impending price breakout with an audacious projection of $136,472 within the next five days. Interestingly, it’s worth noting that this level may represent or come close to the cycle market top, as long-term forecasts include $138,379 in three months and $116,115 in six months.

2025-06-22T18:47:57,"Texas Establishes State-Run Bitcoin Reserve with Passage of SB21","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has officially signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a state-operated fund that will hold Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. The move makes Texas the first U.S. state to not only legalize a Bitcoin reserve but also to directly allocate public funds toward building digital asset holdings. Unlike traditional state investments, the reserve will function outside Texas’ general treasury, serving as a hedge against inflation and a new tool to bolster the state’s financial resilience. Strict Criteria Ensures Bitcoin-Only Holdings According to the bill, only assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion are eligible for inclusion in the fund. Currently, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency meeting that requirement. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund with guidance from a three-member advisory board composed of cryptocurrency investment experts. Reserve Can Grow Through Airdrops and Donations The legislation allows for the Bitcoin reserve to expand through various mechanisms beyond direct purchases. These include blockchain forks, investment gains, and even airdrops or public donations. A transparency provision mandates that a comprehensive report on the fund’s holdings and performance be published every two years. Legal Protections Cement Reserve Independence The passage of SB21 follows the earlier signing of House Bill 4488, which protects the reserve from being transferred into the general revenue fund. This measure ensures the fund remains insulated from broader budgetary shifts and fiscal pressures. Texas now joins Arizona and New Hampshire as the third U.S. state to approve a Bitcoin reserve policy. However, Texas is unique in that it is the first to use state funds and establish an independent structure for its holdings. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin Continues to Grow Public interest in Bitcoin reserves is being mirrored in the corporate world. Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment firm founded by David Bailey, a crypto adviser to former President Donald Trump, recently raised $51.5 million through a PIPE (private investment in public equity) transaction to increase its Bitcoin portfolio. Meanwhile, France’s Blockchain Group has added 182 BTC worth approximately $19.6 million to its reserves, bringing its total to 1,653 BTC. Growing Institutional Demand Signals Enduring Bitcoin Interest Recent data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that more organizations have begun holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the past month. This aligns with a broader trend pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has been at the forefront of public company Bitcoin adoption. The Texas Bitcoin reserve may mark a pivotal step in further institutionalizing Bitcoin’s role within public finance.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/texas-establishes-state-run-bitcoin-reserve-with-passage-of-sb21/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-22T18:45:04,"City in Washington Bans Crypto Kiosks After State Witnessed $141,756,936 in Losses to Scams","A city in Washington has banned crypto kiosks in a bid to crack down on digital asset fraud. The city of Spokane is banning crypto kiosks after the City Council voted unanimously to pass an ordinance that seeks to protect its residents against scams aided by digital asset ATMs. “This ordinance prohibits virtual currency kiosks from being operated in the City of Spokane. Spokane has seen a significant increase in scams arising from the use of cryptocurrency kiosks, and there has been a steady increase in victims losing thousands of dollars. This ordinance provides for a tool to protect consumers from those individuals who rely primarily on virtual currency to defraud others.” Crypto kiosks allow users to buy and transfer digital assets using cash, debit or credit cards. While the machines do not dispense any cash, they allow users to deposit crypto assets in their personal wallets or transfer the funds overseas. “Virtual currency kiosk transactions move quickly, and can occur anywhere and, because of the speed of the transaction, the majority of such transactions are irrevocable… In some cases, law enforcement are able to trace cryptocurrency transactions and ‘follow the money,’ however, many of the ‘scams’ or nefarious transactions transfer funds to destinations overseas, and U.S. law enforcement may encounter significant challenges in other jurisdictions.” Council member Paul Dillon says crypto kiosks have become the “preferred tool” of scammers looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-22T18:11:21,"Controversial crypto donation changes Czech political attitudes","The political upheaval surrounding a Czech minister’s unwise decision to accept a $45 million Bitcoin donation from a drug dealer is set to cement the opposition’s lead in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in October. While the government survived a no-confidence vote, the affair is hurting support for the ruling coalition, the latest polling data indicated. The main opposition party, which initiated the motion, is heading towards victory, backed by almost a third of the Czechs. Controversial crypto donation changes Czech political attitudes ANO, the right-wing populist party of businessman and former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, is on its way to winning the upcoming election for members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house parliament in the Czech Republic. According to a new survey conducted by the STEM research institute for CNN Prima News, ANO (“Yes”) is going to be the leading political party this fall, with more than 31% of the vote, the Czech TV channel reported . Its role as the main opposition force remains unchallenged thanks to a wide voter base, the authors noted. Babiš’s party enjoys significant support among less educated and older people, but it doesn’t lag behind in any other group, the authors noted, adding: “The movement is unthreatened in its position as the leader of opposition voices.” The Spolu (“Together”) center-right coalition, led by the current head of government, Petr Fiala, and his Civic Democratic Party (ODS), comes in second with a little over 20%. At the start of the month, support for Spolu was actually growing. However, the Bitcoin scandal is clearly affecting its results. Highlighting that serious factors like this usually take several weeks to fully manifest, STEM commented: “The question is whether the decline will continue or Spolu will manage to stabilize support.” The far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), another opposition faction, has in the meantime consolidated support and strengthened its position as the main representative of the protest vote. Like ANO, the party fares well among older middle-aged Czechs and those without high school diploma. The centrist and liberal “Mayors and Independents” (STAN) party, an ally of the political alliance of ODS, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL) and the liberal-conservative TOP 09 in the ruling majority, has registered a decline like the rest of the coalition. Its support stands at 9.4% compared to nearly 13% earlier this year. ANO on way to victory despite failed attempt to bring down government STEM’s poll has been carried out between May 30 and June 17, among 2,074 respondents from across the Czech Republic. If the elections were held in that period, ANO would have secured 78 seats in the 200-member Chamber of Deputies while the Spolu coalition would have received 48. The party was the main driver behind the push to topple the current government. Earlier this week, the Fiala cabinet survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, with all parties in it largely supporting the executive power. The whole saga revolved around revelations that the Ministry of Justice had accepted 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in Bitcoin from Tomáš Jiřikovský, the operator of a darknet market convicted of drug trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal possession of arms. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek stepped down from his post to take political responsibility. But the Czech opposition also demanded that the prime minister do the same. ANO said it will continue to push for the resignation of Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura as well, accusing him of failing to notify relevant authorities about the suspicious crypto donation. Other parties included in the STEM survey that may or may not enter the next Chamber of Deputies include the liberal progressive Czech Pirate Party (Pirates) with 7.2%, the leftist Stačilo! (Enough!) with 5.4%, and the anti-green Motoristé sobě (Motorists for Themselves) party with 4.4%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-22T18:00:19,"Bitcoin Treasury Companies: A Double-Edged Sword For The Market – Here’s Why","Bitcoin (BTC) prices have now dipped under $103,000 following a 1.17% decline in the past 24 hours. The maiden cryptocurrency continues to witness a significant market correction since reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Despite the ongoing downturn, BTC remains an outstanding performer in the current crypto market cycle boasting of over 600% price gains since the FTX-inspired market crash in November 2022. Interestingly, Miles Deutscher, a prominent crypto analyst has dived into one of the asset’s most prominent bullish driving factors, highlighting the positive and negative potentials. Strategy, Others: Bitcoin’s Biggest Ally And Risk, Says Deutscher In an X post on June 21, Miles Deutscher shared an interesting take on the potential of Bitcoin treasury companies on the market. For context, a Bitcoin treasury company refers to any business with BTC holdings on their balance sheet. Similarly to retail investors, these companies have opted to acquire BTC as a reserve asset and long-term investment as opposed to traditional assets such as gold, cash or bonds. According to data from CoinGecko , there are 34 publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies with a total holdings of 724, 612 BTC. These companies include names such as Tesla Inc., MetaPlanet Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings, and most prominently, MicroStrategy Inc. (Strategy), which singularly owns 576,230 BTC representing over 2% of the market supply. Generally, the advent of Bitcoin treasury companies have been a resounding bullish development heralding institutional investment into Bitcoin alongside the spot ETF markets. Miles Deutscher postulates that the rising public recognition of BTC’s investment potential by mainstream companies would serve as a contributing factor to the asset’s cprice rise with potential targets set as high as $200,000. However, the renowned market analyst also highlights the potential risk these Bitcoin treasury companies pose as negative catalysts. Due to their fiduciary responsibilities, he warns of a possible scenario where forced selling could occur during a bear market or broader economic downturn. According to Miles Deutscher, the real threat may not be the actual deleveraging, but rather the front-running by smart-money investors anticipating the unwind. He notes that this dynamic could extend to the spot Bitcoin ETF market, which has already attracted over $46.66 billion in inflows . In a risk-off environment, institutional investors could trigger significant outflows, compounding market downside. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $102,843 reflecting a 1.85% decline in the past week.

Following today’s events that led to escalating Iran-US tensions, the Bitcoin price has fallen below the $100,000 mark, which it has been hovering above for a long time. According to Moreno, demand is still increasing in spot markets, but the growth rate has fallen below the historical trend. Related News: Here's the List of 15 Altcoins Experiencing a Surge in Trading Volume in South Korea Moreno stated that Bitcoin purchases made by whales and ETFs have decreased by half, and that demand from new investors is also decreasing. In the futures market, investors have recently started to open new short positions by taking profits. If this weakening in demand continues, according to Moreno, Bitcoin could be a support point at the $92,000 level, which corresponds to the average cost of investors on the chain. This level is considered a typical support area, usually seen in bull markets. However, if this support is broken, the next important support level is around $81,000, which represents the lower band of the average cost of investors. *This is not investment advice.

In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin recorded $209.1 million in liquidations across major exchanges, according to data from Coinalyze retrieved by Finbold on June 22. Bitcoin liquidation chart. Source: Coinlyze The majority, $206.8 million, came from perpetual contracts, with an additional $2.4 million from futures contracts. Long positions were hardest hit, accounting for $184 million, compared to $25 million in short liquidations. The data reflects activity across platforms such as Bybit, Binance , OKX, Bitfinex, Huobi, and BitMEX. Bitcoin price analysis The extended liquidation coincided with Bitcoin falling below the psychological $100,000 mark. Bitcoin was trading at $99,046 at press time, down 4% in the last 24 hours and over 5% in the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, the asset is showing short-term weakness but maintains a longer-term bullish structure. To this end, BTC is trading below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $104,908 but remains well above the 200-day SMA of $87,554. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 42.15, signaling neutral to slightly oversold conditions. While not yet in oversold territory, it suggests limited buying pressure and room for a rebound if support holds. As reported by Finbold, analysts warn that slipping below $100,000 could pave the way for further downside. The report suggested that Bitcoin could retreat to around $80,000 in the coming months if the selling pressure persists. On the other hand, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe’s analysis in an X post on May 22 indicated that Bitcoin has recorded a sharp rise in volatility. He views this as a potential capitulation phase, with the market nearing a major support zone. Volatility going through the roof on #Bitcoin .

2025-06-22T17:10:48,"Bitcoin Leads Crypto Sell-Off After U.S. Bombs Iranian Nuclear Facilities","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp drop Saturday night, leading other cryptos lower, as news broke that the United States had bombed three major nuclear facilities in Iran. The geopolitical shockwave triggered a swift market reaction, sending Bitcoin tumbling to as low as $99,811. The strikes, which targeted Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear sites, were confirmed by President Donald Trump in a post on Truth Social. Calling the attack a “resounding success,” Trump warned that “far greater” force could be used if Iran retaliates. The statement marked a significant escalation following weeks of rising tensions between Iran and Israel, and has pushed global markets, including crypto, into a state of heightened uncertainty. The impact on the broader cryptocurrency market was immediate and severe. Over $40 billion was wiped from total market capitalization within a few hours, dragging the global crypto market cap down to $3.14 trillion, a 2.36% decline on the day as per CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum was hit even harder than Bitcoin, falling 6.83% to $2,196.66. Solana slumped 6.18% to $129, while XRP dipped 5.73% to $1.96. On-chain data from Santiment showed a rapid spike in mentions of “Iran” and “Trump” across crypto-related social media channels. On Sunday, analysts from the firm suggested that the timing of the strikes, late Saturday U.S. time, may have blunted the initial reaction, as much of the retail market was offline. Meanwhile, despite the immediate sell-off, some traders are referencing historical patterns in which Bitcoin recovered quickly from wartime shocks. In 2022, Bitcoin rallied over 40% within a month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More recently, price rebounds followed Iran-Israel missile exchanges in 2024. Still, others are preparing for more downside. Technical analysts have identified $97,000 as a potential key support level, with some predicting a possible dip to as low as $93,000 if tensions worsen. “A dump towards $93K–$94K before bottom formation and reversal,” adding there’s a “20%–25% chance of this happening.” Analyst Cas Abbe warned . He drew parallels to April 2025, when Bitcoin dropped days after U.S. tariff announcements. “Most people thought it was the bottom but BTC actually bottomed 4 days after it.” On current events, he added, “Most are expecting this to be a bottom. But what if April 2025 repeats again? BTC could dump 7%–8% more.” That said, with roughly 40,000 U.S. troops stationed across the Middle East and no clear de-escalation signals from either Washington or Tehran, the situation remains highly fluid. Investors are bracing for further market tremors as the crisis unfolds and global leaders weigh in.

2025-06-22T17:00:13,"$312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support","Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert posted a major alert showing that 129,392 ETH was transferred from an unidentified wallet to Coinbase as the Ethereum price tumbled. On-chain data from Etherscan shows that this particular wallet had not been involved in the transfer of large ETH volumes since November 2022. This sudden reactivation and deposit into a centralized exchange opens up speculation of a looming selloff, especially given the timing of the transfer. Massive ETH Transfer As Middle East Tensions Escalate Whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, which initially reported the transfer on the social media platform X, noted that at the time of the transfer, these 129,392 ETH were worth $312,981,377. The timing of the transfer is noteworthy because it occurred when the price of Ethereum failed to hold above $2,500 and had already begun to struggle to stay above $2,400. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Etherscan’s tracking of on-chain transactions indicates that the unknown wallet “0xd47b,” which was involved in the transfer, has been relatively inactive since late 2022. Particularly, its last transaction was an inflow of 6,469 ETH from another wallet linked to Coinbase. The latest transfer into Coinbase leans more towards the possibility of a selloff through the exchange. Since then, the Ethereum price has lost a key support level at $2,450. Its price has fallen notably in the past 48 hours. Although other factors are clearly contributing to the dip, particularly new geopolitical tensions after the US launched attacks on Iran, this whale deposit into Coinbase may have increased the downward pressure. Exchange inflows of this magnitude are a precursor to liquidation, particularly now that investor sentiment is on edge. Bearish Setup Confirms Downside Targets The technical picture for Ethereum is now turning bearish, at least in the short term. Technical analysis of Ethereum’s 4-hour chart on the TradingView platform shows a clear bearish breakdown setup after Ethereum broke below a crucial support line at $2,362. That support level has now been breached, and confirmation of the breakdown amplifies a bearish case moving forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Chart Image From TradingView The chart above, which includes overlays of the Ichimoku Cloud, shows a fading bullish momentum in the past few days. Previous failed attempts to break resistance have left Ethereum in a vulnerable zone, and the recent whale selloff may have delivered the final push needed to trigger this leg down. If the current trajectory continues, Ethereum could be on its way to retesting lows below $2,000. According to the TradingView analysis, potential reversal targets are at $2,151 and $1,954, with a third possible level at $1,750 if the selloff is more than expected. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,290, down by 5.5% and 10% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

2025-06-22T16:57:17,"Can the Crypto Market End the Month on a High Note? A Price Prediction for the Coming Week For Major Cryptos","As the month nears its end, the crypto market holds investors' attention. There is curiosity about whether leading cryptocurrencies will experience a surge in their prices. This article delves into the upcoming week's price predictions, focusing on major cryptos that could potentially witness significant growth. Get insights into which digital coins are primed for a bullish run. Bitcoin: Short-Term Correction Amid Long-Term Resilience Bitcoin experienced an 8.23% decline over the past month and a 2.93% drop in the last week, while showing a 7.99% gain over six months. Price movements have been volatile, indicating a short-term pullback against the backdrop of mid-term strength. Oscillations have kept Bitcoin within a dynamic trading envelope, revealing both recent selling pressure and prior upward momentum. Bitcoin currently trades between $94,832 and $113,326, with immediate resistance at $121,869 and solid support at $84,880. A secondary resistance at $140,364 and support at $66,385 further define the trading zone. The market appears to be under bearish pressure short term, marked by recent monthly declines, but the six-month gain suggests underlying strength. Traders may consider buying near support levels if prices remain above $84,880 while monitoring for movement towards $121,869 that could indicate a bullish reversal. Ethereum Market Analysis: Past Trends and Present Price Signals Ethereum experienced a decline of roughly 15% over the last month, while the price fell by nearly 34% in the past six months. This trend has shown a gradual erosion of value characterized by repeated pullbacks and a narrower trading range. Price levels have consistently shifted downward, indicating rising caution among traders and an overall bearish sentiment. Recent sessions displayed a mix of downward movements followed by brief recoveries, which were insufficient to reverse the longer-term decline. Previous technical patterns confirm that sellers have dominated the market, prompting traders to reassess short-term outlooks. Presently, Ethereum trades within a defined range between approximately $1,924 and $2,962. The nearest resistance is near $3,395, while primary support is observed around $1,319. Technical indicators such as a sub-40 RSI and negative momentum readings suggest that bears control the market in the short term. There is no clear upward trend, and alternating price bounces complicate predictions for a significant rally. Trading strategies may involve careful short positions near resistance with tight stops, while buying near support could prompt short covering. Traders are advised to remain alert to sudden market shifts and to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Analysis: Declines and Key Support in Focus Solana has shown a steady decline over the past month and six months. The coin recorded a 25.16% drop within one month and a 29.20% fall over the last six months. A weekly downturn of 7.18% also reflects the ongoing bearish performance. Price movements have followed a negative trend with lower highs and a lack of strong buying interest, which has kept the momentum subdued. This pattern indicates that long-term pressure is holding the asset back from a significant recovery. Currently, Solana trades in a range between $136 and $182. The price is facing near-term resistance at $207.9, while support is identified at $115.84. Technical indicators highlight bearish pressure, with an Awesome Oscillator at -16.569 and a Momentum Indicator at -18.03. The relative strength index at 33.23 suggests the coin is oversold and could see short-term buying. However, bears dominate the scene, and traders might consider buying near strong support if a reversal occurs, watching resistance at $253.93 for a potential breakout. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to maintain their current momentum if trading volumes stay high. Solana has shown robust growth patterns and could continue to rise if these trends persist. The coming week presents an opportunity for gains across major cryptos, contingent on favorable market conditions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a new press release , the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says that Oliver Tejada, 25, of the Bronx, New York, has been handed a 60-month prison sentence for masterminding a scheme that stole cash from 11 different bank branches, 10 of which were located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Authorities say that Tejada and his co-conspirators stole more than $1 million from 23 victims, though in some instances the banks caught on and reversed their transactions, resulting in the banks losing a total of $780,837. To pull off their scheme, Tejada and his co-conspirators would target the elderly and other victims to obtain their private bank account information, make calls to banks to gather additional information about their targets, then use an impostor with fraudulent documents, such as a fake ID, to come in to various branches and make large withdrawals or wire transfers. The transfers would be sent to an account of someone who was recruited to receive the money and quickly deplete the account. In some instances, the imposter would use the fake identification documents to obtain a debit card. Tejada was originally charged in May 2024, and he pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.

2025-06-22T16:55:09,"ZachXBT Accuses Garden Finance Bridging Service of Assisting North Korean Hackers to Launder Bybit Funds","Garden Finance, a Bitcoin bridging service, has been accused of assisting hackers to launder money. ZachXBT, a crypto analyst, said that over 80% of Garden Finance’s fees were sourced from laundered money. Garden Finance had around $300,000 in fees. ZachXBT is convinced that Garden Finance is somehow involved in shady transactions and that he can prove it by conducting blockchain analysis. ZachXBT believes there is a link between the Bybit hack of $1.4 billion and the Garden Finance platform. The contention exists over whether 30 BTC was used to enable money laundering. Garden Finance has replied that the 30 BTC was used before the Bybit hack occurred. The debate between Garden Finance and ZachXBT is ongoing. The Bybit hack occurred on February 21, 2025, involving an exploit of a cold wallet, resulting in the loss of $1.4 billion in Ethereum. The attacker compromised a SAFE wallet used by a Bybit developer and exploited the wallet five days after the initial compromise. ZachXBT, amongst other blockchain analysts, traced the stolen funds to DeFi addresses used by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. However, when confronted with the latest accusations, Garden Finance co-founder Jaz Gulati said ZachXBT was basing his analysis on misinformation. ZachXBT asked why money launderers were topping up Garden Finance’s liquidity from Coinbase while moving compromised Bybit funds. The debate continued, with other developers stepping in to give their opinions about the recent controversy. Jaz Gulati, co-founder of Garden Finance, defended his platform against the allegations. He pointed out that the 30 BTC of fees were collected before the Bybit attack, refuting the claim that they had somehow been involved. ZachXBT continued his analysis by claiming other links between Bybit and the WazirX hack, which was linked to the Lazarus Group. ZachXBT surmised that the problem was exacerbated by the fact that Garden Finance was not analysing its blockchain data to prevent a single actor from controlling the network. ZachXBT essentially said the network was compromised due to a lack of decentralized structures within the ecosystem. The arguments against the Garden Bridge may be valid drawbacks to the Bitcoin bridge system, which nefarious groups could hijack to launder money. However, these vulnerabilities may be inherent to the bridging infrastructure rather than the intent of Garden Finance developers. James Scaur, a supporter of Garden Finance, jumped into the debate to support Gulati and to possibly provide a valid reason for the blockchain links. Scaur suggested that the Pareto distribution could provide a valid reason for the unequal distribution of liquidity providers, indicating that only a small number of liquidity nodes give the majority of liquidity for a service. Scaur suggested an alternative reason for the blockchain links that ZachXBT uncovered, pointing out that at any given time, there may be only a few liquidity providers present. Scaur further argued that it is a difficult task to block hackers from using swap services and does not necessarily imply complicity on the part of Garden Finance. However, ZachXBT was not convinced by Scaur’s argument, responding that Garden Finance lacked decentralisation because a single node provided the majority of liquidity for weeks after Garden Finance changed the threshold for large swaps to 10 cbBTC. ZachXBT also pointed out that Garden Finance had minimal activity apart from Bybit transactions, making the platform easy to analyse and spot illicit transactions. Decentralisation loopholes and compliance issues have plagued the blockchain industry lately, with various problems that could disrupt the integrity of blockchains across the globe. Garden Finance prides itself on being a decentralized, trustless bridge service. However, ZachXBT has accused the service of having a single point of failure, which North Korean hackers are exploiting. Jaz Gulati, co-founder of Garden Finance, has not been impressed by ZachXBT’s accusations and has tried to defend his service from being linked with the Bybit hack. However, if a single liquidity provider can dominate the bridging service, the service may function as a private exchange for nefarious activities. Lazarus Group uses various DeFi and mixer services to launder their hacked proceeds. Whether Garden Finance was complicit in helping North Korean hackers or whether they were duped into supporting illicit activities is yet to be established. Traders, however, may be interested in the validity of these bridging services to ascertain whether their funds are truly being swapped with a trustless infrastructure.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/zachxbt-accuses-garden-finance-bridging-service-of-assisting-north-korean-hackers-to-launder-bybit-funds/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Bybit|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

The attack reportedly took out three major nuclear-powered sites, sparking geopolitical tension and a wave of panic across global markets. As news of the airstrikes broke, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies saw heavy sell-offs, with billions wiped from the market in just hours. Many bullish positions were liquidated as traders rushed to pull out of risky assets amid fears of further escalation. The price of Pi Network’s Pi Coin has plunged by 11% in the last 24 hours, slipping dangerously close to its all-time low. At the time of writing, Pi is trading at $0.47, leaving many holders worried about the coin’s future. This latest drop comes after a difficult few weeks for Pi Coin, with prices crashing over 30% in June alone. One of the main reasons behind the fall is a massive token unlock of 263 million Pi tokens this month, worth around $143 million. This huge increase in supply has added selling pressure, pushing prices down. Technical indicators show that Pi might be approaching oversold territory, a level where prices often bounce back. On top of that, June 28th, known as 2 Pi Day in the Pi community — is just days away. Historically, the project has made big announcements around this date, and many are hoping for fresh updates, partnerships, or new features that could lift market sentiment.

2025-06-22T16:28:39,"Why Michael Saylor Is Confident Bitcoin Will Rise To $21 Million By 2046","Bitcoin’s most vocal evangelist, Michael Saylor, is more bullish than ever amid fast-changing regulatory and crypto adoption trends. On Saturday, Saylor upped his ante on his Bitcoin price projections. His new target? An eye-popping $21 million per BTC in 21 years . Saylor’s Ultra-Bullish Bitcoin Price Forecast Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor caused a shockwave in the cryptoverse when he took the stage with a keynote speech at BTC Prague 2025 on June 21. The price of the biggest digital coin may have taken a hit in recent weeks, but Saylor proclaimed that it was still headed to $21 million per coin by 2046, describing this as a “very special time in the network.” “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It’s a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million,” Saylor said. This target represents a spectacular leap compared to his previous prediction made at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville in 2024, when he called for a $13 million price tag by 2045 . The 21 million figure is quite significant in the Bitcoin space, where the maximum 21 million units give the top crypto real scarcity. Super Bullish Developments That “Nobody Guessed” During his speech, Saylor pinned his increasing bullishness on Bitcoin to major regulatory and adoption developments, which he believes nobody expected last year. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this,” Saylor postulated. The uber bull stressed that he has always remained optimistic on the premier crypto, even when its price fell to $16,000 lows during the last bear market, but Donald Trump’s return to the White House has “brought a sea change in politics,” he observed. According to Saylor, even the most ardent Bitcoin advocates had not envisioned such a radical political transformation, with President Trump havin fully embraced Bitcoin. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn’t think we’d get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn’t think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development,” the BTC preacher asserted. He also pointed out that there are three bills currently being progressed in the United States, including the GENIUS Act on stablecoins and the Bitcoin Act. These legislative initiatives around crypto signal unprecedented institutional acceptance of the nascent asset class. Saylor’s Bitcoin development company, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), now holds 592,100 Bitcoin , worth around $58 billion at the current price of $99,581. While reaching $21 million is a mighty target, the convergence of bullish fundamental catalysts highlighted by Saylor makes it a realistic price target.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-michael-saylor-is-confident-bitcoin-will-rise-to-21-million-by-2046/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor",cryptocompare
2025-06-22T16:26:11,"Texas Governor Signs Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Into Law","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has given the final sign-off to a landmark legislation to establish a Bitcoin reserve, moving the state closer to officially adopting crypto as part of its treasury management. Senate Bill 21, a bipartisan-backed bill, was signed into law on Saturday, making Texas the third state in the US to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Texas Governor Approves Bitcoin Reserve Law Texas has joined Arizona and New Hampshire in creating a state-run Bitcoin reserve fund. SB21, also known as “The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” seeks to enable the creation of a Bitcoin reserve outside the usual state treasury that the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage. The reserve is intended to allow the state to invest in Bitcoin and other qualifying crypto assets to potentially hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, as well as strengthen overall financial resilience. However, the law requires that the assets must maintain an average market capitalization of around $500 billion over the previous 24 months. Bitcoin is the only crypto asset that meets this criterion. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin currently sits at over $2 trillion in market valuation. SB21 follows Governor Abbott’s signing of House Bill 4488 , which protects the reserve from being absorbed into the state’s general revenue fund, effectively insulating it from shifting budget priorities. US Government’s National Plans As the third to authorize its treasurer to set up a Bitcoin reserve, Texas could very well beat the U.S. government in forming a stockpile, too. Governor Abbott’s approval comes as US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers propose similar policies at the federal level. Trump issued an executive order in March, authorizing the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, along with a separate digital assets stockpile for other cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-22T16:22:28,"Bitcoin Sentiment Reaches New Lows—But Signals Point to a Bullish Setup","The market mood surrounding Bitcoin has sunk to a level not seen in months, and yet, in an almost paradoxical turn of events, that dismal sentiment may be setting up the cryptocurrency for its next big rally. Discussions happening online around Bitcoin now have the almost eerie feel of being perfectly split in half between people with very bullish views and those with bearish ones. We haven’t seen this kind of appearance of market indecision in quite some time, since back on April 6, when Bitcoin felt the immediate aftershocks of former President Trump’s tariff announcement. Weekly Bitcoin fees rose to the largest value this year, fueled by regulatory clarity and high institutional demand pic.twitter.com/7lAW3RatxG — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) June 20, 2025 Discussion around Bitcoin online now seems almost perfectly split. Although it appears that retail investors are losing confidence in the market, the large-scale holders are doing just the opposite. On-chain data reveals that in only the last 10 days, 231 new Bitcoin wallets holding 10 BTC or more have been created. This latest accumulation by the big fish in the Bitcoin pond—often dubbed “whales”—is another sign that the retail investor seems to be panic selling to the benefit of the large-scale holders. Historically, we have seen these periods of whale accumulation in tandem with retail investor panic prior to major price increases. Bitcoin sentiment is at its lowest in months, but that might actually be bullish Right now, for every 1 bullish #Bitcoin comment online, there’s ~1 bearish one, a split not seen since April 6, when Trump’s tariffs triggered market fear. Meanwhile, 231 new wallets with 10+ $BTC … pic.twitter.com/145Pve6bK4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 20, 2025 Conversely, over 37,000 small holders have left the market in the same stretch of time. Their exits show that small, everyday investors are becoming concerned. some of them, no doubt, are reacting emotionally to the current “vibe” in the market. This is somewhat ironic, as the Venn diagram of small holder and small investor pretty much overlaps: both groups are just trying to get by on a subsistence-level basis in the crypto world. Yet the trajectory of daily exits from the market pretty much ensures that the price of BTC continues to appreciate. Institutional Demand Pushes Fees to Annual High In addition to user behavior with wallets, there has also been a detectable shift in network activity. The average transaction fee being paid by Bitcoin users has reached its highest level of 2023. While that is often looked at as a negative thing, the reasons behind the rise in fees are much more positive. They are, in fact, a direct reflection of a resurgence in institutional demand that is being accompanied by transacting regulatory clarity in a number of key jurisdictions. In the last week, the long liquidation dominance metric has grown from 0% to +10%, while BTC has held within a narrow range of $103K–$106K without significant price corrections. The increase in long position liquidation share without a sharp price crash indicates sustained buyer… pic.twitter.com/dFra1pLV1s — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 21, 2025 Greater fees frequently indicate greater network use and, by extension, greater demand for Bitcoin, whether for trading, settlement, or whatever building reasonable folk might be doing with the Bitcoin network. And right now, the fee environment is suggesting a level of activity that is hard to ignore. We can also juxtapose this with whale accumulation. Indeed, there is a contrasting narrative to the current stock market saga: that people or entities with serious money are buying up Bitcoin and not flipping it. Futures Market Builds Pressure Without Breaking At the same time, the derivatives market is developing and is offering more clues about where the Bitcoin price might be headed. For the past week, the long liquidation dominance metric—this measures how much of the liquidation activity comes from long positions—has been growing, and it has grown quite a bit. It has risen from 0% to now over 10%. And this is happening while Bitcoin’s price is quite stable. It’s in a very narrow range right now from $103,000 to $106,000. Usually, a sharp increase in long liquidations would indicate that prices are soon going to drop because positions are being forcefully closed. However, we are not seeing a corresponding price dip when liquidation volumes spike. This absence of a price dip accompanying a major surge in long liquidations is a sign that there is still a lot of buying support in the market—buoying price levels and holding the structure of the market up. Analysts who follow the markets closely point out that if the long liquidation dominance metric increases by 5% to 7% more, it could create a washout effect. This would clear out any remaining leveraged long positions in the market and shift the overall sentiment in the market to something more bearish. Once this metric starts to decrease again, it could indicate that we’re nearing the end of the washout and that a potential turn in the market might be underway. Conclusion Even though the current state of Bitcoin sentiment seems bleak, looking into the underlying metrics reveals an altogether different narrative. The all-important Bitcoin whales have been busy not just stopping but reversing an almost 18-month-old pattern of accumulation. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-22T16:19:05,"Texas Sheriff Cracks Open Bitcoin ATM After Unusual Scam Record","In a bold and unusual move, the Sheriff of Jasper County, Texas, used a circular saw to cut open a Bitcoin (BTC) ATM to investigate a crypto fraud case. The incident highlights a growing trend of scammers using cryptocurrency to steal from vulnerable Americans, especially senior citizens. A Bitcoin ATM Scam That Cost a Local Resident $25,000 Jasper County is a quiet area northeast of Houston, but it recently became the scene of a high-stakes crypto investigation. According to a Facebook post from the Sheriff’s Office, a resident lost $25,000 in a scam. The victims were tricked into depositing the money into a Bitcoin ATM , believing it was a safe transaction. It turned out to be part of a wider fraud scheme. After getting the necessary legal approval, investigators took action. The authorities broke into the Bitcoin Depot ATM with a circular saw and recovered $31,900 in cash from the machine. Scammers have long used methods like gift cards to avoid protections offered by banks. Now, they are using Bitcoin ATMs because these machines let people quickly turn cash into cryptocurrency. Criminals see this as an easy way to steal money without showing ID or being asked questions. The rise of crypto ATMs has made fraud easier to spread. In 2024 alone, the FBI reported that senior Americans lost $107 million through scams involving crypto ATMs. Because of the growing number of scams linked to them, many governments around the world have shut down crypto ATMs and made stricter rules . Bitcoin Depot Responds Bitcoin Depot, the company behind the ATM, says it is not responsible for the fraud. The company acts only as a money service business that changes cash into cryptocurrency. In a statement, the firm explained that it follows strict rules to stop money laundering and fraud. Bitcoin Depot added that it supports law enforcement and often helps in cases like this. However, Bitcoin Depot clarified that the stolen money is rarely in the machine. Instead, it is usually transferred to another crypto wallet or exchanged. Authorities Say Getting the Money Back Will Not Be Easy Even though the police have recovered the cash from the ATM, the victim will not return it immediately. The court must confirm that the money was stolen before it can be returned. That process can take time and does not always end in the victim’s favor. There is still a small chance the scammer made a mistake, such as using a crypto exchange that works with the authorities. If that happens, investigators can track and recover the stolen crypto. This happened in the famous Colonial Pipeline ransomware case, where the U.S. Justice Department recovered $2.3 million in Bitcoin.

In the last 24 hours, the price of XRP has dropped by over 10%, falling below the important $2 mark at the time of writing. The total market cap has dropped to $3.04 trillion, down nearly 5% in the last 24 hours. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have fallen to $99,000, losing over 4%, while Ethereum has slipped by more than 10% to $2,179. Popular altcoins like Solana, BNB, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also registered losses between 4% and 9%. Market sentiment has turned red, with the Fear and Greed Index now at 40. XRP Price Prediction: On the daily price chart, XRP has broken through a crucial support level around $2.07. Experts had been warning that if this level didn’t hold, the price could slide even further — and that’s exactly what has happened. Now, experts are watching the next important support zone, which sits between $1.92 and $1.95. If XRP continues to fall and breaks below $1.91, the next possible target could be around $1.80 to $1.79, where some past price action and Fibonacci levels suggest support could appear. In the short-term charts, no strong recovery signals have formed yet. Analysts had been hoping to see signs of a bullish divergence, which would hint at a possible bounce, but no clear confirmation has appeared so far. As a result, the trend for XRP remains bearish, and unless Bitcoin and the broader crypto market improve, XRP may continue facing pressure. The market remains highly volatile, especially with Bitcoin dominance increasing and global tensions weighing heavily on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The US Federal Reserve is also under pressure. Analysts also observed that the Fed didn’t cut interest rates recently because of growing instability, and this fresh conflict makes the economic situation even trickier.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-today-as-it-crashes-10-below-2/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

This sharp decline came after shocking news from the global stage: fUS President Donald Trump announced a bombing operation on three nuclear sites in Iran, calling it a “successful” mission that left the facilities “obliterated.” Following this attack, Iran issued a fresh threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — a critical route for global oil shipments. This heightened geopolitical tension spooked global markets, including crypto, triggering a wave of panic selling and liquidations. In just one day, over $1.02 billion worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the slide. Popular altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also broke key support levels, signaling possible further drops ahead. What’s Next for Bitcoin? According to market analysts, Bitcoin is currently testing a support zone between $100,000 and $102,000. If it manages to hold above this, there could be a temporary bounce or sideways movement. However, if Bitcoin falls below this range, the next potential support lies around $96,000 to $97,000. At the time of writing, BTC has dropped below that support. There is also weakening momentum in the larger timeframes. Several technical indicators are hinting at a possible longer correction phase or extended sideways consolidation for Bitcoin in the coming weeks or months. While minor short-term recoveries could happen, analysts predict that strong bullish moves are unlikely in the immediate future due to both technical weakness and ongoing geopolitical risks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-bloodbath-1-billion-liquidated-bitcoin-price-crashes-below-100k/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

In a sit-down with Bitcoin Magazine’s Isabella Santos, the legendary BTC prophet claimed that the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield is the “lynchpin” threatening financial collapse and triggering Bitcoin’s epic moon mission. The Road to $800K In the interview , the Bitcoin bull laid out a doomsday scenario that could potentially lead to an astronomical spike in the king cryptocurrency’s price: “There is one piece of data that is the lynchpin of the entire global financial system… It’s the rate of interest on the 10-year Japanese bond,” Keiser declared. Currently, the yield is at about 3.5%, and any higher, the market watcher warned, could potentially lead to the collapse of the decades-long “yen carry trade,” where Wall Street borrowed near-zero-yen to fuel speculative investments. “The Japanese economy is going to have to start selling U.S. Treasury bonds to stay solid, which would create a cascading event, what I call the bond apocalypse, where the global bond market crashes.” He stated that if this were to happen, then trillions of dollars’ worth of capital would flee collapsing government debt and rush straight into BTC. “In that environment, Bitcoin spikes to $500,000, $600,000, $800,000.” Bearish Caution While Keiser’s prediction might have gotten the crypto community on X talking, the market remains rather tense and confused. Pseudonymous trader Mr Wall Street hinted at a potential short-term nosedive to the $93,000 to $95,000 range, warning that the charts were “screaming for lower.” Still, voices of resilience have been piping up, with analyst Axel Adler Jr. pointing to rising long liquidation dominance without a major price crash as a “good signal,” suggesting strong underlying buyer support. Additionally, on-chain sleuth DeFiTracer sees cooling Middle East tensions due to Iran’s apparent openness to talks as well as Fed member Christopher J. Waller’s signal for July rate cuts as bullish signals.

The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain its bullish form after setting a new all-time high leading to speculations of a potential market top. Interestingly, popular market analyst and the host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Scott Melker has recently shared a market development that supports such bearish notions. Related Reading: Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500–$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone – Details Bitcoin Set For 26% Crash? In an X post on June 21, Scott Melker shares a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market hinting at a bearish long-term outlook. The season analyst reports that data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin’s has now closed below the 50-day moving average (50 MA) on the daily trading chart, a development that last occurred two months ago when Bitcoin traded around $84,000. The 50MA is a commonly used technical indicator that represents the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 days. As a lagging indicator, it helps traders identify the prevailing market trend. When the price remains above the 50 MA, it typically signals a bullish trend, while a move below the 50 MA may indicate bearish momentum or a potential trend reversal. Interestingly, Melker notes that Bitcoin last lost the 50 MA as a support zone in early February trading around $100,000. However, the loss of this price floor triggered an immense selling pressure forcing Bitcoin into prolonged market correction to reach market low of $74,000 in April. Amidst the current market uncertainty, the recent daily price close below 50 MA strengthens bearish sentiments suggesting Bitcoin is due for another potential 26% crash. In that case, investors could expect a downside target of around $76,200. To invalidate such bearish projections, Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $100,000 resistance level, fueling the chances to retest the current all-time high, and perhaps re-enter price discovery mode.

2025-06-22T14:59:31,"Texas Just Backed Bitcoin: Best Crypto to Buy as States Embrace $BTC Reserves","On Saturday, Texas became the first-ever US state to commit public funds towards the purchase of Bitcoin. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21) , officially authorizing the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Keep reading to learn more about this development, increasing investor and government confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, and what’s the best crypto to buy now in order to ride the upcoming crypto wave. Texas Passes Groundbreaking Bitcoin Reserve Bill ‘We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years.’ This is what the Texas Bitcoin bill’s author, State Senator Charles Schwertner, said in February . Four months later, Texas has put its faith in the ‘digital gold’ to strengthen its financials and act as an effective hedge against inflation. It’s worth noting that although Texas is the third US state to create a Bitcoin reserve (after Arizona and New Hampshire), it’s the first to create a publicly-funded reserve. Neither of the other two has allocated public funds for the purchase of Bitcoin. By putting actual taxpayer dollars into $BTC, Texas has not only officially recognized Bitcoin as a store of value but also signaled its unwavering trust and long-term commitment to the digital asset. A publicly-funded reserve is also likely to increase demand for Bitcoin. It’s also worth mentioning that large public companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have aggressively bought Bitcoin over the past few months. With here are some of the best new cryptos you can buy to benefit from Bitcoin’s growing acceptance among corporations and government agencies. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, Get Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to invest in if you want to eke out the maximum amount of returns possible from Bitcoin’s bull run. $BTCBULL’s biggest selling point is that it’s the ONLY crypto on the market right now, offering free (and completely legit) $BTC to its token holders. If you’re a $BTCBULL holder who has stored his tokens in Best Wallet , you’ll receive your share of free $BTC (depending on your $BTCBULL holdings) every time the king cryptocurrency reaches a landmark, such as $150K and $200K, for the first time. Thanks to its never-before-seen approach to rallying behind Bitcoin and community rewards, BTC Bull Token is predicted to explode 270% and reach $0.0096 by 2026 . A huge reason behind this is the project’s deflationary model, which will burn a part of the total $BTCBULL token supply at regular intervals, creating a supply shortage and hiking prices. The best part? $BTCBULL is currently in presale, where it has raised over $7.2M. Each token is priced at $0.002575, and here’s how to buy it . 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Building Layer 2 on Bitcoin for Scalability & Fast Transactions Despite being the OG blockchain, Bitcoin has been struggling with slow transaction speeds and high fees, as well as limited compatibility with decentralized applications and Web3. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . By building a Bitcoin Layer 2 and connecting it to the Layer 1 using a Canonical Bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring programmability and scalability to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Plus, it will do so without impacting the network’s security and decentralization benefits. Here’s how it works: You send $BTC through the Canonical Bridge, which converts it into wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can use wrapped $BTC to access high-speed DeFi apps, pay for transactions on the L2, etc. When you’re done, just raise a withdrawal request on the L2 network. It will again use a smart contract to verify the transaction and convert wrapped $BTC back to original $BTC. Luckily for you, one $HYPER is currently available for just $0.011975 (the token could soar 2,000% by 2030 ), and the project has in total raised over $1.5M. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Educating Folks About Everything Crypto Tutorial ($TUT) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of crypto’s growth and increasing awareness among the masses. That’s because it’s an AI-powered tool that educates people about different crypto-related topics and tools, including setting up a crypto wallet . Other ‘tutorials’ in its repertoire include teaching people how to write smart contracts, trade on the best decentralized exchanges , and learn everything there is to know about the BNB chain ecosystem. $TUT has been on a sensational run of late, gaining more than 25% over just the past 7 days . It’s currently trading at $0.03583, offering a discounted entry point before it explodes to mimic crypto’s rise. As States Back $BTC, Altcoins Emerge as Attractive Investments With regulated, state-backed crypto holdings becoming increasingly mainstream, we’re clearly headed towards a world where diversified crypto assets (the best altcoins included) are looked at as both stores of value and investment opportunities. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing in crypto. The market is highly uncertain, and our article isn’t financial advice.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/texas-just-backed-bitcoin-best-crypto-to-buy-as-states-embrace-btc-reserves/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
