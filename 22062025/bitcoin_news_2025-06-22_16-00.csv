2025-06-22T13:49:11,"Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean? (CryptoQuant)","As bitcoin (BTC) attempts to recover from the effects of tensions in the Middle East, demand for the digital asset is drying up. Market experts from the on-chain intelligence company CryptoQuant have discovered that Bitcoin demand is entering a slowdown period. According to the latest CryptoQuant weekly report , the decline in Bitcoin demand comes after a period of acceleration that pushed the price of BTC towards $112,000. Demand-momentum metrics are currently showing their most negative readings on record — -2 million BTC. Bitcoin Demand is Weakening CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin spot demand has continued to grow but at a decelerated expansion rate. Apparent demand growth has fallen to 118,000 BTC over the last 30 days, compared to 228,000 BTC recorded on May 27. The metric is also below its 30-day moving average, indicating that the demand for BTC is weakening. Bitcoin whale and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have halved their purchases. The expansion of whale balances has fallen to 1.7% month-over-month (MoM) from 3.9% as of May 27. Daily BTC purchases from ETFs are also down from an April 23 local peak of 9,700 BTC to 3,300 BTC today. Additionally, demand from new participants entering the Bitcoin market is low, and overall demand momentum has turned negative. Short-term holders now account for 4.5 million BTC, a decline of 0.8 million BTC from the 5.3 million BTC they controlled as of May 27. Furthermore, investors in the futures market have sold their BTC to lock in profits and are currently opening new short positions. CryptoQuant said its Bitcoin Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric shows that participants offloaded their coins to take profits after BTC hit $110,000 last week. Afterward, they opened fresh short positions as BTC below $105,000 amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran. What to Expect For BTC to experience a sustained rally, whales and spot ETFs need to increase their demand for the cryptocurrency. New investors also need to buy BTC from the old ones, thereby expanding the balances of short-term holders. If demand continues to decline, BTC could plummet below $100,000 and fall to the support zone near $92,000. The crypto asset was hovering around $102,700 at the time of writing following the attacks from the US against Iran. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant has identified $92,000 as the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, which often acts as price support during bull markets. If BTC falls below this level, it could plunge to $81,000, which has been marked as the lower band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price. The post Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean?

The Iranian Parliament has approved a bill to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. The decision will need approval from Iran’s Supreme National Security Council to be fully implemented. A member of the National Security Committee of the Iranian Parliament said the Revolutionary Guards are ready to close the strait if necessary. On the other hand, there have been notable statements and moves from the US and Israel. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated on CNN's State of the Union program that Iran's nuclear program had not been completely eliminated, but had suffered serious damage. Herzog also stated that they did not want to draw the US into a war. Related News: List of Altcoins to Watch in the New Week Published - We're Entering a Hot Week The Pentagon has accelerated the process of sending a second aircraft carrier group to the region, NBC reported, citing senior American officials. The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its accompanying destroyers have been dispatched to the region and are expected to arrive next week. Washington is reported to be keeping two aircraft carrier groups in the Middle East for at least a month. US President Donald Trump announced this morning that a successful bombardment had been carried out on three nuclear facilities in Iran and that these facilities had been “destroyed.” Israel stated that they had acted in “full coordination” with the US in these attacks, while Iranian officials acknowledged that the facilities had been hit but claimed that there were no serious casualties. “Iran still has the military capacity to attack our forces in the Middle East,” a US official told Al Jazeera.

ETH, Pi Network, XRP Prices Down 9% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is reeling from a sharp sell-off over the past 24 hours, driven by a mix of geopolitical tensions, technical breakdowns, and mass liquidations. What Triggered the Crash? The immediate cause of the market crash was a major geopolitical event — U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 22. Ordered by President Donald Trump, the attack heightened fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. The move triggered a global “risk-off” sentiment, leading investors to dump riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in favor of safer options such as gold and the U.S. dollar. As a result, over $636 million in crypto leveraged positions were liquidated, sending shockwaves through the market. How Are Cryptos Reacting? Bitcoin (BTC) plunged sharply to $100,000 before managing a partial recovery. Despite the bounce, overall market sentiment remains in a tricky spot. Ethereum also faced heavy selling pressure, falling over 10% in a single day to around $2,196. XRP wasn’t spared either, dropping nearly 9% to trade at $1.97. Other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) also suffered losses ranging from 7% to 15%. What’s Next for the Market? Analysts warn that unless tensions between the U.S. and Iran ease, cryptocurrencies are likely to remain under pressure. Now all attention is on whether Bitcoin can hold above the $100,000 support level. If it fails, further losses could drag the market lower. Market Sentiment Update The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 40 (Neutral), but this could quickly swing toward “Fear” if geopolitical tensions intensify in the coming days.

2025-06-22T13:35:55,"IREN: Improving Efficiency Position The Company For Growth","Summary I am bullish on IREN due to its industry-leading bitcoin mining efficiency and ability to maintain low production costs amid rising competition and energy prices. IREN’s strategic diversification into AI cloud services and HPC solutions positions it for resilient growth beyond bitcoin mining, capitalizing on higher CAGR opportunities in AI. Financially, IREN boasts strong revenue growth, robust liquidity, and a manageable debt profile, supporting continued expansion and operational flexibility. Given its undervaluation, superior revenue growth, and forward-thinking strategy, I reiterate a buy rating on IREN with significant upside potential despite sector risks. Thesis statement I am bullish on IREN Limited (NASDAQ: IREN ) driven by the improved efficiency of mining bitcoin from 16 J/TH in Q3’2024 to 15 J/TH in Q3’2025. The reason I think IREN’s mining efficiency is a major boost at the moment is because bitcoin mining is still profitable in 2025, but it’s becoming more competitive as more miners continue to join the blockchain market. For instance, Bitmain, Cannan, and MicroBT, which are the manufacturers of over 90% of global Bitcoin mining machines, are establishing a U.S base as a shield strategy against tariffs. This is one of the serious competitive aspects of the Bitcoin mining business. Given this competitiveness, in my opinion, the companies that have an efficient mining strategy are likely to maintain their profitability. It is from this angle I see IREN being a bullish stock. Now, let’s get to production efficiency. Bitcoin production cost in 2025 is up by 9% due to high energy prices and hashrate. Despite this increase, IREN has managed to maintain an efficient mining cost, which is a major driver of its profitability. MinerMag With the increase of hashrate from 5.6 EH/s in Q3’2024 to 29.4 EH/s in Q3’2025, an efficiency of 15 J/TH in the same quarter, the rise in bitcoin price contributed to its profitability from $8.6 million to $24.2 million. According to analysts’ prediction in 2025 that Bitcoin may hit $125,000 from its current ~$106,000 , this positions IREN in a better position to make profits from its efficient mining strategy, which is why I am bullish. I digress further in my explanations below why I believe IREN has a bullish potential. Company brief IREN Limited is a Bitcoin mining company that owns and operates its own data centers. The company also has alternative revenue generation from AI cloud services and high-performance computing (HPC) solutions. In November 2024, the company’s name was changed from Iris Energy Limited to IREN Limited, and it has maintained its headquarters in Sydney, Australia. Efficiency As A Significant Factor The median cost of mining a Bitcoin at the end of 2024 was $52,000 , and this cost has since risen to $64,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This cost is expected to increase by 9%, which is likely to hit an average of $70,000 by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Given this projected increase, IREN is installing over 50EH/s mining capacity by the end of June to compete favorably. Given that IREN is currently mining its Bitcoin at an efficient cost of $25,647 compared to its competitors, such as MARA at $51,877, CleanSpark, Inc. at $36, 139 and Cipher Mining at $44,385, it stands a chance for a bullish trend. MinerMag Now, here is the point. As the production cost increases, the production-efficient companies get some relief when cost-inefficient companies are strained by high production costs. As the production cost rises due to an increase in energy prices, IREN competitors face cost pressures . This highlights the importance of efficiency in the production of Bitcoins, which has driven companies such as Cipher Mining and IREN to post a double-digit score on stock gains between May and June of 2025, above Bitcoin’s modest price increase of 1.35% in the same period. Additionally, IREN is strategically positioning itself for revenue diversification as Bitcoin mining gets too competitive, with rising costs of Bitcoin mining and increasing network difficulty. IREN is diversifying in AI opportunities, such as pausing to expand mining at 50EH/s by the end of June 2025. IREN This broadening of revenue models positions IREN to a resilient business structure within its Bitcoin mining model to remain profitable. With approximately 2.1 million left to be minded, the mining business is getting too competitive and strenuous for a growth outlook. Adding competition and costs of fueling mining is driving a shift to AI opportunities. For example, when I look at IREN, despite ramping up its mining fleet, the pause at 50EH/s to focus on AI shows its preparation for other revenue generation activities. There are more AI opportunities compared to Bitcoin based on their CAGR. The mining market is estimated to have a CAGR of 10.57% between 2024 and 2035, which, compared to AI opportunity at a CAGR of 40% between 2023 and 2030, makes it reasonable for IREN to pause Bitcoin mining fleet enhancement. The demand for AI is ready for data centers, with an average of 70% demand for data center capacity. AI workloads are expected to advance by 2030, as seen with Gen AI, which is offering the fastest advanced AI use case. The demand for this advanced AI capacity is estimated to grow at a 33% CAGR between 2023 and 2030, which is why AI has more growth outlook compared to Bitcoin mining. The management of IREN and its ability to read the signs of time, like AI exodus from mining, shows its well-managed resilience, which is why I recommend a bullish position, McKinsey Financials; Q3’2025 highlight Due to the efficiency of production at 15 JT/H and 40EH/s, revenues in Q3’2025 increased by 164.8% YoY from $543 million in Q3’2024 to $148.2 million. The company’s diversification to AI opportunities saw AI cloud service generating a revenue increase of 500% from $0.6 million IN Q3’2024 to $3.6 million in Q3’2025. Adjusted EBITDA rose from $21.8 million in Q3’2024 to $83.3 million, reflecting an improvement in core business operations. For example, comparing Q3’2025 to Q3’2025, the average operating hashrate increased by 30% after Childress expansion from 22E.6 EH/s to 29EH/s. This increased Bitcoins mined in the third quarter by 12%, from 1,347 Bitcoin to 1,514 Bitcoin. On average, the price realized per Bitcoin increased by 11% from $84.3k to $93.3k. This was primarily driven by an increase in energy costs from $28.9 million to $36.5 million. This delivered a profit after tax of $24.2 million from $8.6 million in Q3’2024. The profits were also driven by an increase in Bitcoin in April and May of 2025, which rose from $76.0K to $111.0K. It indicates its resilience in efficiency and diversification, leading to profitability. Looking at the balance sheet, the company debt stands at $564.2 million due to a substantial convertible note of $322.5 million, which has a maturity period of 2029. Given that the company is pausing the extension of bitcoin mining enhancement at 50 EH/s by the end of June 2025. This me to a concern as to whether its debt-to-asset ratio is well managed. The total assets are $1,989.8 million, and its debt-to-asset is 0.28 or 28%, which is below the technology industry debt-to-asset ratio of 57.61% . This indicates that the current assets at IREN are capable of supporting its debt by a larger margin. Given the ample time the company has until its debt maturity in 2029, it indicates that it has a stable financial footing. Also, the company closed its Q3’2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $184.3 million and a total operating expense of $61,8 million. This shows that it has a liquidity coverage of 2.98, which is approximately 3x available cash reserves to operating expenses. The company is in a flexible position to finance its operations without strain. This can be seen in its ability to forecast expansion of 50 EH/s, which reduced capex by $43 million. Valuation I will value the company using Revenue YoY, and price-to-cash flows in relation to its competitors CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLSK ), MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ: CIFR ). Based on my bullish analysis that looks at IREN’s profitability and diversification into AI opportunities, I believe these metrics are the best valuation metrics at the moment. The revenue YoY shows that IREN has a high growth at 128.24% compared to its competitors, CLSK at 89.47%, MARA at 40.57%, and CIFR at -0.65%. Seeking Alpha The price-to-cash flow of all its competitors is negative. IREN P/CF is the second highest negative at -11.26, after CIFR at -13.06. Comparing IREN with CLSK at -6.92 and MARA at -6.34, they have a relatively higher P/CF ratio, which means their cash flows are higher and match the current price. However, in terms of P/CF, IREN is undervalued given that it has the strongest revenue YoY compared to its competitors, yet P/CF is valued to be low, which is why I believe the current price is not justified. Seeking Alpha These metrics confirm that IREN has a high bullish potential driven by its capacity to mine bitcoins at a minimum cost and its shift to AI opportunities, which present a bigger revenue generation. Given its EPS normalized estimate of $0.25 and its forward PE by the end of June 2025 of 82.58x, I approximate an upside of 98% from $10 to $20. This is within analysts’ estimates of between $20.30 to $33.00. Marketbeat Investment risks Bitcoin price volatility – Bitcoin is a volatile coin, and IREN faces a risk of market correction in case of a bearish move, which means a possible loss of revenues. Energy price fluctuations – Mining has become expensive due to rising energy costs. This is a risky situation for IREN if the prices keep increasing, which may reduce its profit margins further even at its existing efficiency. Technological obsolescence – By pausing the expansion of bitcoin mining machines at 50 EH/s, IREN faces a risk of revenue decline in case another company invests in an expansion that overtakes its efficiency. Conclusion The company is an ideal investment given its bitcoin mining efficiency and its preparation to mitigate mining competition by moving to AI opportunities. I am reiterating a buy entry on IREN at the current price.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796390-iren-improving-efficiency-position-the-company-for-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","IREN",cryptocompare

With the June 27 options expiry approaching, price action reflects tightening conditions as bulls and bears clash near key technical zones. While the broader structure remains rangebound on higher timeframes, lower timeframes reveal weakening bullish momentum and signs of increasing volatility. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price?

2025-06-22T13:30:16,"Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens","Bitcoin’s narrow price movement over the past week contradicts a much different development in the futures market. According to Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, a sharp rise in the long liquidation dominance metric could set the stage for a significant shift in sentiment that may completely wash out bears from the market. Adler shared the data in a recent post on X, accompanied by a chart showing previous points that resemble the current setup. Long Liquidation Spike Without Price Crash The dominance of long liquidations has jumped from 0% to +10% over the past seven days, a move that typically shows distress among bullish traders. However, what makes the current development especially noteworthy is the absence of a steep crash in Bitcoin’s price. Instead, in the just concluded week, Bitcoin held mostly within the $103,000 to $106,000 range until a recent drop, despite facing increasing pressure from long-side liquidations. Related Reading: XRP Daily RSI Trendline Breaks Down – What It Means For Price Axel Adler Jr. explained that this sustained liquidation of long positions without a full-blown price collapse indicates sustained buyer support. According to data from CryptoQuant, BTC’s long liquidations hit 2,200 BTC, the highest in the past week. Usually, a surge in long liquidations suggests that traders who were anticipating a price rally are being pushed out of their positions under pressure. The CryptoQuant chart below shows how spikes in long liquidation dominance, especially in the 15% to 20% range, have always preceded bullish reversals. According to the analyst, if this metric rises by another 5–7%, it could cause a high-probability scenario where bearish positions are washed out and flip Bitcoin’s price movements in favor of the bulls. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Large Wallets Accumulate As Retail Exits Data from Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, shows an interesting dynamic playing out among Bitcoin holders. Over the past ten days, wallets holding over 10 BTC have increased by 231 addresses, which is a 0.15% rise. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets containing between 0.001 and 10 BTC have dropped by 37,465 in the same timeframe. This trend highlights a divergence in sentiment between large and retail holders. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break? According to Santiment, the shift where whales and sharks accumulate while retail exits is a bullish combination for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market value is hovering just below $104,000 during this accumulation phase, and there could be an eventual upward breakout once retail holders begin to reenter. Image From X: Santiment Despite the underlying on-chain strength, Bitcoin’s spot price has taken a short-term hit in the past 48 hours. During this timeframe, Bitcoin’s price has slipped below support levels between $106,000 and $103,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,670, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The decline can be largely attributed to recent U.S. strikes on Iran. The U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 21-22) caused immediate risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin fell 3.2% after announcements of the strikes, much like its 6% drop during similar 2020 Iran tensions.

Bitcoin faced a sharp rejection after attempting to break above an important resistance zone. After the failed breakout, the price dropped straight into a crucial buy zone, triggering liquidations across the market. In total, over $400 million worth of long positions were wiped out in just a day. A major factor behind this recent market nervousness is the United States entering the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Analysts believe that if the situation worsens further, it could negatively impact global financial markets — whether stocks or crypto — causing a sharper decline. With fears of a potential World War III rising, investors rushed to the safety of gold and the US dollar, while riskier assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies saw heavy selloffs. Additionally, in the recent FOMC meeting, interest rates were not cut as expected. This paused the market’s momentum and dampened the optimism for a quick recovery. A bull market might take a little longer to arrive. Amid the current market uncertainty, investors are searching for a bullish spark to lift sentiment. Speculation is swirling about Bitcoin potentially surging to $200,000 or even $250,000 by the end of the year. In an interview with Coinpedia, Jetking, an Indian company accumulating Bitcoin from 2022 said, “We predict Bitcoin prices to be in the range of $ 140000-150000 by year end.” Bitcoin Short-Term Price Action: Bitcoin price briefly touched ₹101,000, then attempted a small recovery.

Experts are now closely watching the ₹100,000 support level — a crucial point that needs to hold to avoid a deeper correction. It is struggling to break past the ₹102,600 resistance zone. A recovery is possible if Bitcoin manages to reclaim this level, but so far, that hasn’t happened. If the price fails to hold ₹100,000, another drop could follow, possibly with reduced trading volumes.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/exclusive-bitcoin-price-prediction-150k-bitcoin-dream-isnt-dead-yet-despite-market-crash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T12:43:23,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Crashes Below $101,000 As US Airstrikes Send Shockwaves Across Markets","Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,979 after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted successful strikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps As US Strikes Key Sites In Iran US President Donald Trump announced that the United States had conducted successful airstrikes targeting key nuclear installations in Iran. Markets plunged after the announcement, with BTC dropping to a low of $100,979 as traders panicked. Trump took to Truth Social to state, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. Source: TradingView BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Despite facing volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday, BTC registered an increase of 0.35% but fell 0.24% on Thursday to settle at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and settling at $103,388. The price plunged below $101,000 on Saturday as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $102,000 and settle at $102,180. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $102,558.

According to the lawsuit, the victim claimed the trading school introduced him to a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised him life-changing rewards for his investments only to end up scamming him. In the lawsuit filed in a federal court, the victim, Brian Firestone claimed that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC), which operated in downtown Denver, was in partnership with a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners in Cherry Creek in the scheme. According to Firestone, he was first approached in December by a man named John Smith, who he said claimed to represent the trading school. Florida man sues crypto trading school after $860,000 loss According to Firestone, Smith offered to tutor him on the basics and in-depth technicals in crypto trading. He noted that Smith even offered him a gift of $500 to kickstart his learning process, one which was a ploy to eventually lure him into the elaborate scam. The trading school’s website, which is now defunct, lists its address as 1600 Lincoln St. The platform directed its users to carry out all their crypto trading services on CoinBridge, which claimed to have raised $10 million from 600 investors. According to Firestone, CoinBridge is a fake establishment masquerading as a real exchange. The lawsuit mentioned that ASITC allegedly used a method known as signal trading. According to the lawsuit, Firestone claimed that professors would message participants in the ASTIC classes at different times with clear trade instructions at different times. Students are then expected to follow these instructions, which end with them executing trades using their CoinBridge account. Firestone said that his initial $500 investment from the gift from Smith quickly rose to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his balance started reading $2 million. He didn’t hold back on his appreciation for the professor. “Professor, I must thank you,” Firestone texted Smith on Feb. 8. “My results were outstanding. Thank you for letting me in this trade today. This is so exciting!” he said. However, things started to move from good to bad for Firestone after a losing trade brought his balance back to $12,000. According to Firestone, he then wired $470,000 in cash and took a loan of $330,000 from ASITC to continue trading. He mentioned that after the influx of cash, his balance on CoinBridge read $24.5 million, until a USDT trade he carried out on March 9 failed to execute. “I can’t close it,” Firestone messaged Smith. “I ncant clpsoe it.” Firestone said it was a “system error” that caused the glitch, leading to his balance getting erased on the platform. Two days after that ordeal, he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, bringing the total to $6.6 million. However, he was not able to repay part of the loan as ASITC allegedly shut down his account on May 1. According to the suit, Firestone is accusing ASITC, CoinBridge, Smith, and platform founder Raymond Torres of fraud, racketeering, and theft. The real CointBridge Partners in Wyoming has also denied any connection to the scam. Meanwhile, over $2.1 billion has been stolen in several crypto-related incidents since the beginning of 2025, with most of the losses tied to wallet breaches and key mismanagement, according to CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu. The trend shows that hackers and malicious actors are moving from targeting platforms in code-based hacks to users. In 2024, phishing attacks accounted for over $1 billion in losses across 300 incidents, making it the most damaging method of attack in the crypto space.

Trump Wallets Offload TRUMP Tokens Hours Before US-Iran Clash","TL;DR On-chain data shared by Lookonchain shows that the Official Trump team deposited another sizeable batch of the asset to centralized exchanges yesterday. While they have done this in the past on numerous occasions, this particular transfer raises questions about inside information, as it came just hours before the US attacked Iran. The wallet linked to the #TRUMP team deposited another 3.527M $TRUMP ($32.8M) to #Binance 30 minutes ago. Since April 28, wallets linked to the #TRUMP team have deposited a total of 12.54M $TRUMP ($150.68M) to exchanges in 4 batches. https://t.co/SwzribrM5d pic.twitter.com/26IksmyHvM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2025 It was just a few months ago when TRUMP skyrocketed as the US President invited the top 220 holders to attend a special dinner event with him in the States. Naturally, people rushed in to buy the token, which doubled in value in days and exceeded $16 in late April. However, speculators started to take profits off the table, and TRUMP corrected almost immediately. Nevertheless, it remained above $10 for the next several weeks before Israel’s attacks against Iran took place last week. The past 24 hours have been particularly brutal to altcoins as the US joined Israel in attacking Iran. This is evident by the growing bitcoin dominance , and the Official Trump meme coin has not been spared. The asset has slumped by over 6% on a daily scale and now trades well below $9. This is why many X users questioned whether the team was aware of what was to take place just hours after they transferred more than $32 million worth of TRUMP to Binance. It’s worth noting that the US President confirmed the attacks at 00:50 BST (19:50 local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social, which was several hours after the transfers to Binance.

2025-06-22T11:45:19,"US Dollar Now Effectively Replaced As World’s Reserve Currency by This Asset, According to Black Swan Author Nassim Taleb","Economist and best-selling author Nassim Taleb says a single asset has overtaken the US dollar’s position as the world’s de facto reserve currency. In a new interview with Bloomberg, the Black Swan author says that the US dollar has lost its status as a reliable safe-haven asset, noting that people prefer to invest in the stock market rather than hold a currency that declines in value over time. He also says that America’s sweeping sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine marked the beginning of the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. According to Taleb, gold is now the world’s reserve currency, highlighting that the dollar’s credibility eroded after America and its allies weaponized the USD. “That would end up being reflected in stocks, the slow decline of the dollar, and effectively, there’s a second risk. The first one is the deficit, the second one is effectively that the dollar is losing its status as a reserve currency… You can see the accumulation of gold in the reserves and the behavior of gold over the past 12 months. And it didn’t start with Trump’s policies. Of course, it started with Biden when he froze the accounts of people connected to Putin, and of course, thinking that it would be limited there, but people not connected to Putin decided to stay away from the euro and the dollar. And gold is effectively now the reserve currency. Transactions take place in dollars and euros, usually dollars, and at the same rate, however, they get converted back into gold.

2025-06-22T11:39:00,"Kaspa Technology Praised by Experts, But Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates More Accessible Wealth Path","In the fast-shifting world of crypto, one pattern has become undeniable. Early-stage presale tokens have consistently outperformed the broader market, especially when backed by real tech, active communities, and massive potential. According to recent Live Coin Watch data, many of today’s top performers were once unknown $5 or $8 tokens. Now, a new contender is catching fire, and it’s not just talk. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the next massive mover, and momentum is accelerating faster than expected. Kaspa Made Waves, But Can It Reach the Masses? Kaspa has been a favorite in the proof-of-work crowd for its blockDAG approach and speed. Its underlying technology is impressive and solves several legacy blockchain issues, especially around scalability. However, it still requires traditional hardware to mine, which makes it less approachable for the everyday user. Despite strong developer backing, Kaspa hasn’t bridged the gap between institutional-grade innovation and widespread accessibility. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flips the script. Bitcoin Solaris Is Rewriting the Crypto Playbook Bitcoin Solaris was built on a single idea: make mining and blockchain wealth creation something anyone can participate in. From a technical angle, the project is light years ahead. At its core is a dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid approach gives BTC-S both security and scalability, delivering up to 100,000 transactions per second on the Solaris Layer with 2-second finality. But the deeper magic is in its accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S straight from their phone, laptop, or even browser. This alone has positioned BTC-S as one of the most inclusive mining ecosystems in crypto today. Key Features Driving Momentum: Dual-consensus architecture for maximum scalability and security Validator rotation and cross-layer interaction for network resilience Up to 100,000 TPS and real-time block finality Energy-efficient mining using just 0.05% of Bitcoin’s energy footprint Zero-Knowledge Proofs for optional privacy features Smart contract infrastructure built for DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and more The combination of speed, power, and accessibility is making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens right now. The Rise of Universal Mining: Wealth from Your Pocket BTC-S isn’t just about powerful infrastructure. It’s about making that power usable by anyone. Thanks to its Universal Mining model, users can mine directly from nearly any device. A smartphone? Done. A regular laptop? Easy. Even advanced miners with ASICs and GPUs are supported, with the system optimizing performance per device. Once live, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will give users access to: One-tap mining with adaptive algorithms Built-in wallet with real-time rewards tracking In-app tutorials to guide beginners Compatibility with Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web For those looking to calculate what they could earn from mining, the BTC-S mining calculator is a great starting point. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands A Community That’s Already Catching Fire More than 11,500 users have already joined the presale, and interest continues to climb. Many crypto influencers and analysts are calling it one of the best early-stage opportunities of the year. A detailed review from the Crypto Vlog breaks down why this project is drawing attention across the ecosystem, from retail holders to serious mining enthusiasts. What makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out isn’t just hype. It’s transparency. The project has already passed audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring the underlying technology is secure and trustworthy. The team also maintains an active presence through platforms like Telegram and X , where updates and community conversations continue to grow daily. Why This Presale Is a Big Deal The Bitcoin Solaris presale is already in its eighth phase and gaining serious traction. The price is currently $8, with the next jump coming soon. The launch price is set at $20, offering a potential return of 150 percent for early participants. Time is limited, though. With the launch set for July 31, only around six weeks remain before the window closes. This is not just a typical token sale. It’s shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history. With over $5 million raised and thousands already onboard, it’s hard to ignore the momentum. To get involved or learn more, check out Bitcoin Solaris . A Technical Core That Backs the Hype What sets BTC-S apart is that the performance isn’t just talk. Its reward distribution system is finely tuned, offering structured incentives that prioritize long-term contribution and network health. BTC-S reward distribution structure: 40 percent goes to PoW miners 25 percent to Solaris Layer validators 20 percent to stakeholders 10 percent reserved for development 5 percent power community incentives Mining rewards are calculated based on device type, contribution score, and time-weighted participation, ensuring fairness and decentralization. These mechanics are why many are calling it a project built not only to last but to empower. Final Thoughts: Is This the Wealth Gateway You’ve Been Waiting For? Bitcoin Solaris is more than a coin. It’s a gateway into a new era of wealth creation, one that doesn’t care if you’re holding a $3,000 rig or a budget smartphone. While other projects chase high-speed numbers or institutional validation, BTC-S is quietly building something for the people. If you’re looking to enter crypto with real utility, real earning potential, and real accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris might just be your moment.

2025-06-22T11:31:18,"Samson Mow eyes Europe Bitcoin expansion after France invite","Jan3 founder Samson Mow is weighing in on advocating for Bitcoin in Europe after a promising discussion with pro-Bitcoin French legislator Sarah Knafo. In a Saturday X post , he commented: “It was great to meet Knafo Sarah, and she’s invited us to visit France! Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe!” Samson Mow discussed Bitcoin agenda with Sarah Knafo At the BTC Prague event this week, Mow met with a member of the European Parliament, Sarah Knafo, and discussed how his company could help craft Bitcoin-forward policies in France and develop a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Knafo even described their meeting as excellent and acknowledged Mow for his advisory role to the president of El Salvador and many other leaders. She added that France has to step up and tackle these issues head-on, hinting at more Bitcoin advocacy in the future. According to Knafo, she invited Mow and his team to France. She also met with Strategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, who she found to be “visionary and ambitious.” France has been actively expanding its involvement with crypto. Most recently, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 BTC for €60.2 million, about $68.7 million, raising its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, in March, Bpifrance committed €25 million, equal to about $27 million , to cryptocurrency investments to support France’s blockchain and crypto innovation. Revolut , a European neobank with crypto support, also announced plans to invest over $1.1 billion in France and pursue a local banking license in May. It is also preparing to add at least 200 more people within three years. Knafo confirmed that more crypto projects will soon be in Europe and the country. So far, about 10% of French citizens hold crypto assets, and roughly 33% of French people plan to acquire crypto assets in 2025. However, France still lags behind compared to adoption rates in the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), and Belgium (17%). However, France has seen a 10-point increase in public interest, reaching 33%. This puts it just behind Italy, which leads at 37%. Europe’s crypto adoption is still low compared to other countries worldwide Some crypto executives have expressed concerns over Europe’s lower crypto adoption than the rest of the world. In March, Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, stated that European corporate adoption remains limited. Fabrega argued that the investors are reluctant to join the crypto community because of underlying structural barriers, including regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional endorsement, and an underdeveloped market. He added, “Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Nonetheless, the European Union has become more open to crypto assets, first proposing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), a digital token regulatory framework, in September 2020, adopting it in May 2023, and fully implementing it in December 2024.

2025-06-22T11:24:13,"Bitcoin Dominance Skyrockets as ETH and Other Altcoins Plummet","Bitcoin’s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours after the US attacked multiple Iranian nuclear sites, and the asset plunged to a multi-week low. The altcoins have posted even more notable price declines, which is evident from the growing BTC dominance. Bitcoin Tries to Recover The business week began on a different note as the primary cryptocurrency shot from under $105,000 to $109,000 by Tuesday. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection that pushed it south hard as the tension in the Middle East continued to rage on. In a matter of hours, BTC dumped to $103,500 before the bulls initiated an impressive leg up that drove the asset higher by around $3,000. Nevertheless, the overall negative market sentiment continued , and bitcoin started to lose value once again in the following days. The culmination came earlier today as the US launched “successful” attacks against multiple nuclear sites in Iran, as described by the POTUS. Moreover, Trump warned that there will be more violent strikes if Iran decides to retaliate in any form. Bitcoin’s price tumbled below $101,000 for the first time in almost three weeks. However, it remained within a six-digit price territory and has recovered to $102,500 as of now. Its market cap is down to $2.040 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has skyrocketed to almost 63% as most bleed out. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Deep in Red The rising BTC dominance in times when the cryptocurrency’s price is dropping means only one thing – the alts have it even worse. Interestingly, it’s not just the lower caps that are suffering badly. Ethereum, the largest of the bunch, has dumped by over 7% in the past 24 hours and is close to breaking below $2,200. Recall that ETH stood tall close to $2,800 just until a week ago. Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and LINK are also deep in the red from the bigger alts. Even more painful declines come from VIRTUAL, APT, INJ, TIA, TAO, SEI, JUP, FET, and PEPE, as all of them are down by double-digits on a daily scale. These developments are only supporting a recent report, which claimed that those hoping for an altseason are relying mostly on “ wishful thinking ” rather than any hard data.

Bitcoin dropped to an intraday low of around $101,000, causing a considerable uptick in liquidated positions. Bitcoin Price Dips to $101,000 As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s price dipped to an intraday low of $101,000. It has since recovered a little bit and trades at $102,500 at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView That said, the volatiltity remains enhanced, which has resulted in a whopping $700 million worth of liquidated positions across derivatives markets. Data from CoinGlass shows that this represents an increase of more than 55% compared to yesterday’s levels, attesting to the uncertainty of the ongoing situation. The turmoil is largely caused by the US decision to strike Iran earlier today, despite Donald Trump saying that he will take two weeks to decide on future moves, just a few days ago. Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, also started making preparations for the possibility the conflict might spread to their territory in a clear sign of escalation. The same is true for Saudi Arabia. Altcoins Deep in the Red The declines spread across altcoin markets as well, which took even bigger of a beating.

The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive selloff last week amid growing fears of war escalation.

2025-06-22T10:38:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Will Outperform Ethereum’s 92,000% Growth History","Ethereum’s rise from under a dollar to over $4,000 became one of the most talked-about investment stories in crypto. The 92,000% return was real — but it took years to develop, with slow adoption, infrastructure delays, and high user friction along the way. Bitcoin Solaris is operating on a much tighter timeline. Token price has already moved from $5 to $8 during the presale. Over $5 million has been raised. More than 11,500 investors are already in. Unlike Ethereum in its first phase, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t waiting to deliver function — it’s doing it now. Utility Comes First — and It Pays Immediately With the Solaris Nova App, mining is no longer limited to people with specialized rigs or locked capital. Anyone with a compatible smartphone can mine BTC-S using idle storage and CPU — and start earning in minutes. This is protocol-level mobile mining, not outsourced compute or simulated rewards. Returns during beta already exceeded many staking platforms. There are no hardware barriers, no staking lockups, and no technical complexity. The app is live, and it’s growing in user base as more people realize they can earn simply by participating. The protocol’s infrastructure has passed independent audit by Freshcoins , while core contracts have been verified by Cyberscope . The development team has completed full KYC verification , establishing trust ahead of launch. Analyst Coverage Confirms Early Momentum Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention for the right reasons. In a recent Crypto Vlog review , the project was praised for delivering actual results at the presale stage — a rarity in the current market. Analysts are watching early performance metrics, not just the roadmap. More importantly, users are actively engaging with the network, mining with mobile devices and earning before any centralized exchange listing. While other early projects ask investors to wait for value, Bitcoin Solaris is distributing it from the start. Supply Is Fixed, Demand Is Active, and Pricing Is Still Low Bitcoin Solaris is capped at 21 million tokens. Just 4.2 million are in the presale. No emissions. No delayed unlocks. No backdoor allocations. Supply is clean and predictable — and every token already has a function. BTC-S is used for transaction fees, for mining rewards, and inside the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — which is live and running now. Every registered user gets one free spin per day. No token required. Just log in, spin, and collect if you win. For buyers, the casino unlocks reward tiers based on purchase size. Spend $250, and you access bigger spins. Spend $2,500, and you’re in for draws worth up to 0.5 BTC. It’s fast, automatic, and designed to keep tokens circulating instead of sitting idle. The token will also power the Mining Power Marketplace, now under construction. There, users will rent and monetize excess compute power on-chain. Supply meets demand, directly — no third parties needed. Products Are Live and In Use Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising a future product — it’s already operational. The Nova App is doing what it’s supposed to. People are mining. The Casino is running every day and pushing tokens back into circulation. The Marketplace is being built now — not promised later. Wallet upgrades are on the schedule, testnet is close, and the dev suite is nearly wrapped. None of this is staged for marketing — it’s work in progress, backed by actual timelines, not placeholder graphics on a pitch deck. Bitcoin Solaris is producing returns, distributing access, and expanding adoption before most altcoins even finish their whitepapers. Price momentum is already building inside the presale. Phase 8 is open. Supply is limited. And for serious investors, this may be the last cycle where early-stage, real-utility gains are still within reach.

2025-06-22T10:32:57,"Market Roundup: How Major Cryptos Moved This Week","This week in crypto brought a blend of resilience and hesitation across major assets. Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

2025-06-22T10:32:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Already Down, Iran Attacks Send BTC Price to $102,760 – Buy the Dip?","Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped sharply as geopolitical tensions rise, down to $102,760 as risk assets sell off. The decline follows a major escalation in the Middle East where US military forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, expanding the Israel-Iran conflict. This geopolitical shock triggered immediate market reactions with investors moving into traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Bitcoin, seen as a speculative asset during times of high volatility, fell 9% from its monthly high of $111,800 to $101,053. Bitcoin sold off all day & made up more than half of its losses in the last 30 minutes. Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is at $102,777 with over $47 billion in daily volume. The risk-off tone intensified after Iranian officials condemned the strikes and threatened retaliation. Iran’s Foreign Minister called for an emergency UN meeting, while Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a situation “getting out of control”. This sent equities and digital assets into a tailspin with BTC leading the way. Bitcoin Traders Reprice Risk as Bitcoin Falls The US strikes have deepened global fears of a wider war involving Israel, the US, and Iran. As tensions rose, Israel closed its airspace, Iran threatened key military and nuclear sites in the region and media reports emerged of bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles used in the operation. Israel closes airspace after US attack on Iranian targets; land crossings with Egypt, Jordan remain open – Airports Authority https://t.co/2zHClVYd9v pic.twitter.com/csMtu5kNFC — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) June 22, 2025 While the IAEA confirmed no radiation leaks, the psychological impact was big. Fears of disruption to global trade, energy markets and long-term regional security sent traders running. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge has again been called into question as it’s behaving like a risk asset during times of global stress. Monthly Drop: ~8.93% from $111,800 to $102,438 Weekly Loss: Over 2% and still falling Market Cap: $2.04 trillion Circulating Supply: 19.88 million BTC Former President Donald Trump’s comments saying the strikes were a “big success” only added to the fears of further escalation. With diplomacy stalled and Iran warning of “consequences forever” the crypto market is uncertain. Unless the political situation stabilizes, Bitcoin will likely continue to underperform as traders reduce risk. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Still Cautionary From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish. The 2-hour chart shows price action stuck in a descending channel with lower highs and lower lows. BTC failed to retest $103,932—the 50-period EMA which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A series of small candles at $102,900 indicates indecision, but no bullish reversal patterns, such as a morning star or three white soldiers, have formed to change the trend. Momentum is weak with the MACD signal lines flatlining below zero and the histogram not recovering. BTC did briefly touch support at $101,478 before bouncing with a long lower wick, so buyers are defending that level for now. Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: At $102,900 on bearish confirmation (e.g. shooting star or bearish engulfing) Stop-Loss: Above $104,100 Target 1: $101,478 Target 2: $100,451 Until price breaks above $104,031 and out of the descending channel the short-term is bearish. Any bounce is likely corrective not a reversal. Conclusion Bitcoin’s drop to $102,760 is a sign of investors reducing risk in the Middle East chaos. With macro headwinds getting stronger and no technical confirmation of a bottom, traders should be cautious. A true “buy the dip” opportunity may require a ceasefire or a confirmed break above resistance.

2025-06-22T10:31:00,"Michael Saylor Predicts $21 Million Bitcoin Price by 2046, Here’s Why","Bitcoin bull and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) founder Michael Saylor has made another eye-catching prediction for the leading cryptocurrency, asserting that BTC could hit $21 million per coin in 21 years. Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference on Saturday, Saylor’s keynote address highlighted both the evolving global crypto environment and his unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years,” Saylor told the crowd. “It’s a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” This bold forecast far exceeds his previous estimate from the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he projected Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045 . The shift, Saylor explained, stems from unforeseen global developments that have significantly strengthened BTC’s narrative over the past year. “A Sea Change in Politics” and Surging Adoption Saylor credited a “sea change” in geopolitical sentiment and U.S. policy as key reasons for his updated outlook. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary,” he said, pointing to the Biden administration’s surprising embrace of BTC and regulatory momentum in Congress. “We didn’t think the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said. “We didn’t think we’d get a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” The Strategy founder cited three major U.S. legislative efforts—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act—as evidence of this changing tide. He emphasized that several U.S. states are also warming up to BTC, reflecting a broader shift in regulatory sentiment that “nobody guessed” just a year ago. Saylor, who has famously supported BTC through market highs and lows, said Donald Trump’s return to the White House further catalyzed this shift, boosting institutional confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Saylor’s renewed optimism comes as Strategy recently added another $1 billion in BTC to its holdings, bringing its total to 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025. However, questions remain about how and where this vast reserve is stored. While the firm has not revealed its custody arrangements, Saylor has publicly rejected calls to provide proof-of-reserves, citing security concerns. His previous dismissal of self-custody also drew criticism from the Bitcoin community—though he softened his stance in late 2024, saying he supported the approach “for those willing and able.” The post Michael Saylor Predicts $21 Million Bitcoin Price by 2046, Here’s Why appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-predicts-21-million-bitcoin-price-by-2046-heres-why/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Michael Saylor|Bitcoin price prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T10:22:01,"Analyzing the Impact of an XRP ETF on Market Dynamics","The anticipation surrounding the potential approval of an XRP ETF has captivated the financial and cryptocurrency markets. This development could significantly alter the landscape for one of the top digital currencies by providing it with broader exposure and legitimacy. In collaboration with Outset PR , this analysis considers the strategic implications of ETF approval for XRP and how it could catalyze a sustained price rally. The Role of ETFs in Cryptocurrency Acceptance Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have emerged as a pivotal factor in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem.

Similarly, a U.S. ETF for XRP, currently viewed as highly probable by industry experts, could invite a surge of institutional funds into the market. Canada has already seen the launch of an XRP-based ETF by 3iQ Corp, which has been listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Visit CoinDesk's coverage for details. Current Market Status and Future Projections of XRP XRP's price has demonstrated resilience and volatility, as shown in recent trading data from TradingView . The asset fluctuates between $2.05 and $2.30, occasionally pushing towards higher resistance levels.

2025-06-22T10:19:45,"Analyst sets date when Bitcoin could crash to $80,000","A trading analyst has warned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could lose its $100,000 support and face deeper losses in the coming months if the bearish sentiment continues. In particular, Master Ananda’s analysis indicated that a decisive break below $100,000 could open the door to a drop toward the $88,888 and $82,500 range, he explained in a TradingView post on June 22. According to the analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels on the daily chart suggest that if Bitcoin falls through $100,000, it could quickly slide to around $88,000 at the 0.618 level, and potentially to $80,000 at the 0.786 level, areas where demand has appeared before. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView The analyst noted that a rapid selloff could follow without buyer support at these levels. Interestingly, this bearish setup depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above $100,000, which it has managed so far. If it does, a strong rebound is still the most likely outcome. The outlook also suggested that a quick drop to $80,000 would probably be short-lived before the uptrend resumes. The next two to three days will be crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin stays supported or faces further losses. If $100,000 fails, a move toward the $80,000 area might be achievable by early October. Bitcoin enters major demand zone Meanwhile, pseudonymous crypto analyst BitBull suggested in an X post on June 22 that the current bearish mood might be a healthy reset for Bitcoin. According to BitBull , Bitcoin is testing a major demand zone between $100,000 and $103,500, where whales have been actively accumulating. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: BitBull He highlighted this price range as a key area of interest, as it is a strong support floor for the cryptocurrency. Despite fears and an “everything is over” narrative in the market, the expert noted that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains solid. Technicals show this demand zone has historically been a stronghold, and Bitcoin still looks promising in a broader time frame. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,284, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours and over 3% on the weekly chart. Moving ahead, bulls need to push the price back to $103,000 to open the door for a retest of $105,000. However, if Bitcoin loses the short-term support at $102,000, a drop below $100,000 looks increasingly plausible.

2025-06-22T10:10:52,"This Week in Crypto: Key Market Movers and What Comes Next","This week in crypto has been anything but quiet. From Bitcoin testing new resistance levels to Ethereum's slow grind upward and Solana’s potential rebound, key players are showing signs of life amidst recent volatility. For traders and investors alike, these movements could signal the early stages of a broader market shift—or at least a short-term window of opportunity worth watching. This market recap is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native communications agency that helps Web3 projects seize attention while the spotlight’s hot. With performance-based campaigns and live market awareness, Outset PR ensures narratives hit when momentum matters most. Bitcoin Eyes Next Resistance, Potential 11% Rally Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price currently hovers between the low hundred thousands, finding a path through a slight dip over the last month. It's nudging close to its nearest resistance level just below one hundred and fourteen thousand. If it breaks through, eyes could be on the second resistance at around one hundred twenty-two thousand, indicating an impressive climb of approximately 11% from current levels. Supported by the simple moving averages, Bitcoin's potential for growth remains hopeful, despite recent declines. As indicators like the RSI and Stochastic suggest room for upward movement, traders and enthusiasts are keenly watching the levels that could signal a more significant upward trend. Ethereum's Slow Climb: Can It Break Through the Ceiling? Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently navigating the $2367-$2804 range, aiming to reach the $3060 resistance level. With its 10-day and 100-day averages both around $2538, ETH seems to be holding steady despite recent dips. The 1-week price dipped over 5%, while the 6-month change shows a 25% drop. The nearest support is close at $2186, giving some room to recover. An upward move could push prices to challenge $3497, marking a potential 30% gain from the current resistance. Despite the current lull, bullish momentum might eventually overpower bearish sentiments if key levels are breached. Solana (SOL) Bounces Back: Bullish Hopes Amid Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently experiencing a dip, with values swinging between about $140 and $167. Recently, the coin's value declined by roughly 5.5% over the past week and nearly 15% in the last month. Despite this slump, Solana shows promise for a rebound. If buyers regain momentum, it could challenge the resistance level of $181, a potential climb of over 20% from lower levels. A further leap could drive prices towards the next marker at $209, suggesting an even more significant gain. But watch for immediate support around $127 to see if Solana can find a firm footing for the next upward push.

2025-06-22T10:00:46,"US Bitcoin ETFs Hit 9 Days Inflow Streak Despite Price Struggles","The spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been in good form over the past few weeks, receiving renewed interest from investors in the United States. This recent spurt of momentum has been a rare bright spark in the crypto market, which has been overwhelmed with investor uncertainty lately. Interestingly, the typically straight line between the spot Bitcoin ETFs’ performance and the BTC price action has not been particularly straight in the past few weeks. While the crypto-linked financial products have shone in the past few days, the underlying premier cryptocurrency has seen better days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $1 Billion In The Past Week According to the latest market data, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETF market recorded a total net inflow of $6.37 million on Friday, June 20. This performance marked the ninth successive day of positive capital influx for the crypto investment products, signaling increased investor interest and demand. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets SoSoValue data shows that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) was the only BTC exchange-traded fund with net inflow on Friday. The trillion-dollar asset manager’s fund added a remarkable $46.91 million in value to close the week, as it continues to lead the pack in net assets. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other Bitcoin ETF that recorded any activity on Friday. According to market data, the second-largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund by net assets posted a daily net outflow of $40.55 million on the day. Nonetheless, the $6.37 million single-day performance pushed the US-based Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record above the $1 billion mark. While this figure falls short of the exchange-traded funds’ performance ($1.39 billion) in the previous week, it still represents a trend in the right direction after enduring two weeks of nearly $300 million in outflows. Bitcoin Price Falls Below $101,000 Level Despite the positive performances of the US-based Bitcoin ETFs, BTC’s price has continued to struggle to build any sustained bullish momentum over the past two weeks. The flagship cryptocurrency seemed set for another trip to a new all-time-high price earlier this week before succumbing to some bearish pressure mid-week. In the late hours of Saturday, the price of BTC fell to below the $101,500 level as another wave of downward pressure hit the crypto market. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $101,484, reflecting an almost 2% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin is down by nearly 4% in the past seven days.

2025-06-22T10:00:43,"Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Previous High As MidEast Conflict Escalates – Altcoins Under Pressure","Bitcoin has officially lost the $103,600 support level following shocking geopolitical developments. The US military reportedly launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, triggering widespread panic and risk-off behavior across financial markets. The crypto space was no exception. Bitcoin, which had been holding above key support for weeks, rapidly sold off as fear gripped traders and investors alike. This breakdown marks a shift in sentiment. Bulls have lost control of short-term momentum, and the broader market now braces for a potential drop below the critical $100,000 psychological level. With no immediate signs of relief, selling pressure may persist unless strong demand emerges near range lows. Top analyst Carl Runefelt pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has just surpassed its previous high, indicating that while Bitcoin bleeds, altcoins are under even more pressure. This capital concentration in Bitcoin could be interpreted as a flight to relative safety within the crypto ecosystem, but it also highlights growing uncertainty and lack of confidence in higher-risk tokens. Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test As It Hovers Near $100K Bitcoin is at a critical juncture as it flirts with a breakdown below the psychological $100,000 mark. After weeks of holding above this level, the market is beginning to show signs of fatigue. Yet, despite the selling pressure, bulls have managed to defend the $100K threshold for now, suggesting it may be forming a new base of support. A sustained hold above this level could trigger a sharp recovery, potentially reigniting momentum toward previous highs. However, the macroeconomic backdrop remains highly volatile. Rising US Treasury yields continue to tighten liquidity conditions, while the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates adds further uncertainty. Meanwhile, escalating conflicts in the Middle East, including the recent US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, have injected fear across global markets. Bitcoin has historically responded to geopolitical risk with mixed behavior—sometimes acting as a safe haven, other times following broader market risk aversion. Adding to the complexity, Carl Runefelt recently noted that Bitcoin Dominance has just broken above its previous high. This signals that capital is concentrating on Bitcoin, while altcoins suffer heavier losses. The shift reflects growing caution in the market, with investors opting for perceived relative safety over speculative risk. Whether this capital rotation will eventually fuel another leg up for Bitcoin—or mark the start of a broader downtrend—remains to be seen in the coming days. Bitcoin has now been trading above the $100K level since early June, indicating that the price may be attempting to stabilize around this range. Yet failure to reclaim the all-time high near $112,000 continues to cap bullish momentum. If bears force a breakdown below $100K, the next support may not emerge until the $94K–$95K zone. BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Defend Critical Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,506, hovering just above the key support zone at $100,000. The chart shows BTC failing multiple times to break through the $109,300 resistance level, resulting in a gradual decline and increased selling pressure. The $103,600 area—which previously acted as support—has now been lost, confirming weakness in short-term bullish momentum. On the 3-day chart, price remains above all major moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs, signaling that the macro trend is still intact. However, volume has been decreasing as the price consolidates, suggesting hesitation among market participants. A decisive move—either a bounce from $100K or a breakdown below it—could set the tone for the next phase of Bitcoin’s trend. The price action suggests that BTC is forming a new local range between $100,000 and $109,000. If the bulls manage to hold $100K and push back above $103,600 in the coming sessions, a retest of the range highs may follow. On the flip side, a sustained move below $100K could open the door for a sharper correction toward $95,000 or even $92,000 in the short term. Market watchers are closely monitoring this level as the battle between bulls and bears intensifies.

2025-06-22T09:54:05,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as South Korea Green‑lights Spot ETFs","South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has officially submitted a roadmap to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025, marking a dramatic reversal of its previous ban on retail ETF products. Alongside this, the plan outlines a blueprint for a won-backed stablecoin ecosystem and enhanced exchange transparency and fee disclosures. 🚨 🇰🇷 South Korea’s Financial Services Commission submits roadmap to approve spot #crypto #ETFs in H2 2025. pic.twitter.com/bmkYDJKg8m — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) June 20, 2025 This shift could open regulated on-ramps for domestic investors who, until now, have lacked safe, compliant access to digital assets. As global markets, from the U.S. to the EU, race to embrace spot ETFs and stablecoins, South Korea’s move signals that its retail-hungry crypto sector may soon see a surge of institutional-grade products, bringing new opportunities for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. South Korea Charts Course for Spot Crypto ETFs and Won Stablecoins by Late 2025 South Korea’s financial regulator has filed plans to approve spot crypto ETFs and a local stablecoin market. This signals a major policy shift, targeting late 2025 implementation. The FSC submitted its roadmap supporting President Lee's pledge to lift the crypto ETF ban. Local investors could soon access regulated spot crypto products for the first time. Developing a Korean won-backed stablecoin ecosystem is also a key goal. Officials believe this can reduce capital flight and offer safer crypto choices domestically. The FSC stressed these plans remain tentative and unconfirmed. Yet they highlight a clear government move towards broader crypto market openness. South Korea boasts a huge retail crypto market, holding $75 billion late last year. Clear rules are vital for both local and global players. Historically strict, Korea banned most crypto investment products for regular people. President Lee's team is actively changing that stance now. This push includes proposed stablecoin rules, exchange transparency, and investor safeguards. It's part of a wider pro-crypto strategy. Regulators are advancing the next phase of their digital asset framework. This covers listings, fair fees, and tougher penalties for market cheats. Global pressure mounts as the US and EU race ahead with crypto ETFs and stablecoins. Korea feels the heat to stay competitive. This roadmap is a game-changer. Korean investors have long waited for regulated access to spot crypto ETFs and stablecoins. If implemented, it will bring Korea in line with global leaders like the US and EU, according to Simon Kim (CEO of Hashed, a Korean VC). https://t.co/6cRGX0uNgJ — Simon Kim (@simonkim_nft) June 5, 2025 If the roadmap holds, spot Bitcoin ETFs could launch here late next year. This opens doors for fresh institutional and retail money. Regulators walk a tightrope balancing innovation with necessary oversight. However, the momentum for change is clearly building strong. Korea plans close work with banks to oversee ETF transactions properly. They demand clear operations, strong reviews, and good risk tools. Alongside crypto rules, the FSC may extend stock exchange hours significantly. Stricter rules for public companies are also rolling out now. This green light shows that the nations beyond the US and the UK are getting receptive to the ETF offerings. And since the crypto talk has now seeped into regulations, chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This green light shows that nations beyond the US and the UK are becoming receptive to ETF offerings. And since crypto discussions have now seeped into regulations, the chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This is a critical time for such a recovery as well, since BTC price action has not inspired much confidence lately, especially with the market reeling under the intense geopolitical backdrop involving Iran and Israel. That being said, as far as ETF news is concerned, Cryptoquant reports that there has been an influx of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which has now reached 128,000 BTC, indicating that institutional interest has been restored. This, combined with the progressive news coming from the regulatory front, could help restore market balance. Best Crypto To Buy Now With South Korea poised to open its market to spot ETFs and homegrown stablecoins, investors may soon enjoy safer, regulated routes into digital assets. These reforms could attract fresh institutional capital and boost liquidity across the board, setting the stage for a renewed bull run. For those scouting the market’s next big bets, here’s the best crypto to buy now. Solaxy With the rise of ETFs, Solaxy’s smart contract layer could become a top choice for DeFi yields once institutional capital enters Korean exchanges, making it an attractive option for risk-conscious traders. Solaxy is making a splash in June 2025 with its goal of becoming the first real Layer-2 on Solana. The platform is addressing issues like congestion, slow throughput, and developer challenges on Solana. By offering a solution that enhances dApp speed and scalability, Solaxy maintains Solana’s low-cost structure while providing a smoother experience for both developers and users. Similar to Ethereum's rollups, Solaxy bundles off-chain transactions, settling them in batches on Solana. This offloading keeps the mainnet efficient, enabling 10,000 transactions per second, with reduced fees and faster confirmations. Strong whale activity and a sharp supply reduction have made Solaxy one of the most anticipated presales of the year. Listings on major exchanges are expected soon, boosting visibility and price momentum. Renowned crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins believes Solaxy has the potential to see a 338% price increase. Due to high demand, Solaxy has extended its presale timeline, offering more investors a chance to get involved. The project remains committed to transparency, security, and sustainable growth. SUBBD South Korea’s move to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025 is set to boost regulated crypto investment opportunities. This could enhance adoption for utility tokens like SUBBD , which focus on AI-driven creator-fan engagement, by attracting more institutional and retail interest in innovative digital assets. SUBBD isn’t just another platform focused on profit; it transforms fan engagement into a rewarding, interactive experience. Fans gain control, unlocking premium content, exclusive livestreams, and valuable perks for participation. The $SUBBD token powers this ecosystem. Token holders can stake coins to earn platform credits, which are redeemable for tipping and exclusive rewards, enhancing their overall experience. What makes SUBBD unique is its AI-powered tools, enabling users to create lifelike media like images and videos. This interactive approach turns passive fans into active participants, driving innovation in the crypto presale space. Positioned as the leading “AI agent creator platform,” SUBBD equips creators with advanced tools, such as voice cloning and automated video production, making content creation faster and smarter. The platform supports diverse income streams, including subscriptions, NFT sales, tipping, and pay-per-view content. For $SUBBD holders, this means early access to updates, premium content, and reduced subscription costs. At the crossroads of AI, blockchain, and the creator economy, SUBBD taps into three of tech’s fastest-growing industries. These sectors aren’t just rising; they’re exploding, making SUBBD a major player in this space. BTC Bull As Bitcoin ETFs gain traction, BTC Bull is engineered to amplify every rally, poised to catch the tailwinds of Korea’s new regulatory push and deliver a turbocharged ride for momentum hunters. Bitcoin remains strong above the six-figure mark, even amid global tensions. With the safe-haven narrative around Bitcoin growing stronger, it’s becoming an attractive asset in uncertain times. For many, buying a full Bitcoin is still out of reach. BTC Bull Token offers a more affordable alternative, providing exposure to Bitcoin’s potential with built-in passive rewards and no risks tied to DeFi. Holders of BTC Bull Token earn Bitcoin rewards directly tied to Bitcoin’s price growth. This means passive income that aligns with Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation without the complexities of DeFi platforms. It doesn’t just track Bitcoin’s price; it rewards supporters by burning tokens to decrease supply and offering airdrops to generate value. BTC Bull Token unlocks Bitcoin rewards for holders at key price milestones. Starting at $150,000, each new reward tier opens at $50,000 increments, with the next rewards coming at $200,000 and $250,000. The calm before the bull run. 🐂🎯 pic.twitter.com/etsqZ58cIj — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 19, 2025 In addition to rewards, BTC Bull Token features a deflationary burn mechanism. At each $50,000 milestone, starting at $125,000, the token supply is permanently reduced through burns, mirroring Bitcoin’s own scarcity model. Conclusion South Korea's spot ETF roadmap and stablecoin strategy supported by the won indicates a tipping point in its policy for digital assets, with regulated access and more robust investor protection promised. It is not just a demonstration of the country's search for market maturity, but also indicates a trend towards institutional adoption and more transparent crypto regulation globally. For retail and professional investors alike, these trends provide a system under which to invest capital with more assurance. By targeting the best cryptocurrency to buy now that has structural strength in addition to growth potential, investors can set up their portfolio to profit from Korea's next crypto chapter.

In a new interview on CNBC, Lee says he’s watching for a point when the Fed could run into an “accident,” where it waits too long to address a slowing economy. Lee says he’s anticipating a potential “panic” scenario from the Fed. “There could be an accident because what we are ignoring is that housing is choking and collapsing under the weight of higher interest rates, and the labor market isn’t as strong as it appears. When we look at the ability to get a job, it’s much harder. So… there’s long and variable lags, and there could be an accident where the Fed would have to panic, so I think that’s something we have to watch in the incoming data… I think there could be a point where the Fed suddenly realizes the risks are actually to the downside for the economy weakening, and so the Fed will actually have to respond to an economy that they’re strangulating and really fighting what they believe is a supply shock inflation. So I’m a little concerned that the Fed could be late if they continue to hold.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
