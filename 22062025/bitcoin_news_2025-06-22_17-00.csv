The cryptocurrency is down 5.5% throughout the last seven days. Source: TradingView The market downturn has also caused a broader selloff amongst altcoins, most of which are deep in the red, resulting in almost $1 billion worth of liquidated positions, according to CoinGlass. As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, the US joined the war between Israel and Iran, striking three strategic nuclear Irany sites. In response, some media reports indicate that the Iranian Parliament has voted in support of closing the Strait of Hormuz – one of the world’s most criticial oil transit chokepoints. This resulted in immediate increase in oil prices, which are up almost 1% on the day, sparking international fears of inflation and economic turmoil. Traders are seemingly derisking and it’s interesting to see how deep this correction will extend.

The Strait, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, handling roughly 20% of the global oil trade. Reports of Iranian politicians mulling the closure of the Strait had observers worried about a significant spike in oil prices early Monday. ""After US strikes on Iran last night, 50+ large oil tankers were scrambling to leave the Strait of Hormuz. Markets have been closed, but an immediate drop in supply is expected to send prices higher. JP Morgan described this as their worst-case scenario in the Israel-Iran war,"" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. According to JPMorgan, oil could surge to $120-$130 per barrel in that scenario. That could potentially lift the U.S. inflation rate to 5%, the highest since March 2023. At the time, the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates. The losses in BTC weighed heavily over the broader crypto market, as usual, dragging major altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ETH lower.

ABC News reports that Veer Chetal, who is among the three men charged with siphoning 4,100 BTC worth $243 million in an elaborate scam last August, also agreed to testify against his co-defendants, Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano. Authorities say that the trio engaged in online social engineering attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send fake alerts to victims about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts. Chetal and Serrano would then call and pose as representatives from companies like Google and Yahoo in an effort to access victims’ accounts. Prosecutors say that Chetal, Lam and Serrano lived large after the heist , spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. But a week after the theft, Chetal’s parents were abducted in a botched ransom scheme. The suspects planned to demand payment from Chetal, believing he held large amounts of cryptocurrency. But the abductors were arrested quickly after the police responded to eyewitness calls. An off-duty FBI agent also happened to be passing by just as the kidnapping unfolded. Unsealed court documents also show that Chetal is being accused of playing a role in 50 similar heists that siphoned $3 million from victims between November 2023 and September 2024. Chetal now faces up to 24 years in prison, a fine ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 and restitution to the victim.

Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe says the answer isn’t so simple. In fact, he believes the altcoin market may be approaching a similar turning point to the one it experienced in past cycles, just before making significant moves. But is it time to give up or hang tight? Altcoins Down 80%: A Cycle Unlike Any Other The year started with big hopes, especially for altcoins. But instead of a rally, most altcoins dropped over 80% from their highs. According to analyst Michael Van de Poppe notes that this cycle is different from anything we’ve seen before, making it hard to compare to past market moves. This market cycle isn’t following the usual patterns. Is the #Altcoin market death? Well, that's a great question to ask yourself as you're seeing a constant bleed taking place on the markets with zero reversal. Especially when the expectations of this year were enormous, and, as a result, we've been getting an 80% decrease on… pic.twitter.com/iRcXra01cX — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 21, 2025 He believes we’re in a period similar to late 2019 or late 2020, times in crypto history that marked the bottom for altcoins before a new rally began. To support his view, van de Poppe draws comparisons with earlier cycles, like those in 2016 and 2019. In both cases, altcoins bottomed out during times of global uncertainty, while gold prices were climbing. Fast forward to today, and we see a similar picture: gold is strong, global markets are unstable, and investors are being cautious with risky assets. Why Altcoins Aren’t Moving Yet Despite a recent 40% surge from Ethereum against Bitcoin, most altcoins haven’t followed. Van de Poppe says this is because confidence and positive sentiment are missing from the altcoin space. Right now, it doesn’t take much selling to push prices lower, but there’s also quiet accumulation happening ; some investors are slowly buying up coins at these low levels. What Needs to Happen Next Poppe believes the next move depends on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin manages to bottom out and climbs toward $106,000, it could boost Ethereum again. That second push could trigger a strong rally across the altcoin market. And once that happens, short positions might get liquidated, leading to fast and sharp price moves up.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-the-altcoin-market-really-dead-or-just-waiting-for-its-moment/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Samson Mow is working with Sarah Knafo to promote a Bitcoin reserve strategy for France. France is ramping up both public and private Bitcoin activity. Despite progress, critics say Europe still lacks a clear position on Bitcoin as a state-held reserve asset. Mow met with Knafo at the BTC Prague conference this week, where the two discussed plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve for France and explore regulatory frameworks favorable to Bitcoin. After the meeting, Mow posted on X , saying he was “looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe.” Pro-Bitcoin EU Lawmaker Knafo Echoes Support for Nation-State Adoption Knafo, a member of the European Parliament with openly pro-Bitcoin views, echoed the enthusiasm. “France must take hold of these issues,” she wrote on X. She described Mow as “an expert on Bitcoin adoption by states, who has advised the President of El Salvador and many others.” Mow left Blockstream in 2022 to focus on helping governments integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies.

On June 3, Paris-based Blockchain Group announced the purchase of 624 BTC for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. In March, state-owned bank Bpifrance allocated €25 million to crypto-related investments. Still, Europe faces criticism for its slow pace. While the EU’s MiCA framework was fully enforced in December 2024, critics argue it lacks clarity on Bitcoin’s role in state treasuries. Coinbase and Gemini Push Deeper into EU Last week, it was reported that Coinbase and Gemini are expanding their European operations by securing regulatory licenses in Luxembourg and Malta, respectively. Gemini, led by the Winklevoss twins, is close to finalizing its license in Malta after receiving a MiFID II license from the country’s Financial Services Authority last month. Malta has already licensed exchanges like OKX and Crypto.com under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. However, some EU regulators are concerned about the speed of approvals in smaller nations with limited staff. Malta’s FSA defended its pace, citing years of experience and strong anti-money laundering standards. Meanwhile, Coinbase is set to receive a license from Luxembourg, where crypto firms have been labeled “high-risk” for money laundering . Coinbase has over 200 employees in Europe and plans to hire at least 20 more.

""The MPs have unanimously reached this conclusion merely in a consultation capacity. The decision lies with the Supreme National Security Council,"" Azimi said on X , responding to several media reports , including Al Arabia , that the Parliament has approved the closure. The Strait, a key global oil shipping route, accounts for one-fifth of the world's oil trade. Thus, the closure of the route is likely to send oil prices skyward, possibly into three figures, bolstering stagflation fears in oil-importing trade deficit nations like the U.S. Analysts expect Brent and WTI crude prices to open significantly higher on Monday, pricing a potential supply squeeze. In the meantime, an obscure token called the digital oil memecoin (OIL) has skyrocketed over 400% against USD, according to data source DEXTools.io .

2025-06-22T13:49:11,"Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean? (CryptoQuant)","As bitcoin (BTC) attempts to recover from the effects of tensions in the Middle East, demand for the digital asset is drying up. Market experts from the on-chain intelligence company CryptoQuant have discovered that Bitcoin demand is entering a slowdown period. According to the latest CryptoQuant weekly report , the decline in Bitcoin demand comes after a period of acceleration that pushed the price of BTC towards $112,000. Demand-momentum metrics are currently showing their most negative readings on record — -2 million BTC. Bitcoin Demand is Weakening CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin spot demand has continued to grow but at a decelerated expansion rate. Apparent demand growth has fallen to 118,000 BTC over the last 30 days, compared to 228,000 BTC recorded on May 27. The metric is also below its 30-day moving average, indicating that the demand for BTC is weakening. Bitcoin whale and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have halved their purchases. The expansion of whale balances has fallen to 1.7% month-over-month (MoM) from 3.9% as of May 27. Daily BTC purchases from ETFs are also down from an April 23 local peak of 9,700 BTC to 3,300 BTC today. Additionally, demand from new participants entering the Bitcoin market is low, and overall demand momentum has turned negative. Short-term holders now account for 4.5 million BTC, a decline of 0.8 million BTC from the 5.3 million BTC they controlled as of May 27. Furthermore, investors in the futures market have sold their BTC to lock in profits and are currently opening new short positions. CryptoQuant said its Bitcoin Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric shows that participants offloaded their coins to take profits after BTC hit $110,000 last week. Afterward, they opened fresh short positions as BTC below $105,000 amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran. What to Expect For BTC to experience a sustained rally, whales and spot ETFs need to increase their demand for the cryptocurrency. New investors also need to buy BTC from the old ones, thereby expanding the balances of short-term holders. If demand continues to decline, BTC could plummet below $100,000 and fall to the support zone near $92,000. The crypto asset was hovering around $102,700 at the time of writing following the attacks from the US against Iran. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant has identified $92,000 as the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, which often acts as price support during bull markets. If BTC falls below this level, it could plunge to $81,000, which has been marked as the lower band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price. The post Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean?

2025-06-22T13:43:08,"HOT MOMENTS: New Developments Between Iran and the US Cause Major Drop in Bitcoin and Altcoins – Here Are the Details","Tensions in the Middle East are rising rapidly. The Iranian Parliament has approved a bill to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. The decision will need approval from Iran’s Supreme National Security Council to be fully implemented. A member of the National Security Committee of the Iranian Parliament said the Revolutionary Guards are ready to close the strait if necessary. On the other hand, there have been notable statements and moves from the US and Israel. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated on CNN's State of the Union program that Iran's nuclear program had not been completely eliminated, but had suffered serious damage. Herzog also stated that they did not want to draw the US into a war. Related News: List of Altcoins to Watch in the New Week Published - We're Entering a Hot Week The Pentagon has accelerated the process of sending a second aircraft carrier group to the region, NBC reported, citing senior American officials. The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its accompanying destroyers have been dispatched to the region and are expected to arrive next week. Washington is reported to be keeping two aircraft carrier groups in the Middle East for at least a month. US President Donald Trump announced this morning that a successful bombardment had been carried out on three nuclear facilities in Iran and that these facilities had been “destroyed.” Israel stated that they had acted in “full coordination” with the US in these attacks, while Iranian officials acknowledged that the facilities had been hit but claimed that there were no serious casualties. “Iran still has the military capacity to attack our forces in the Middle East,” a US official told Al Jazeera.

ETH, Pi Network, XRP Prices Down 9% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is reeling from a sharp sell-off over the past 24 hours, driven by a mix of geopolitical tensions, technical breakdowns, and mass liquidations. What Triggered the Crash? The immediate cause of the market crash was a major geopolitical event — U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 22. Ordered by President Donald Trump, the attack heightened fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. The move triggered a global “risk-off” sentiment, leading investors to dump riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in favor of safer options such as gold and the U.S. dollar. As a result, over $636 million in crypto leveraged positions were liquidated, sending shockwaves through the market. How Are Cryptos Reacting? Bitcoin (BTC) plunged sharply to $100,000 before managing a partial recovery. Despite the bounce, overall market sentiment remains in a tricky spot. Ethereum also faced heavy selling pressure, falling over 10% in a single day to around $2,196. XRP wasn’t spared either, dropping nearly 9% to trade at $1.97. Other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) also suffered losses ranging from 7% to 15%. What’s Next for the Market? Analysts warn that unless tensions between the U.S. and Iran ease, cryptocurrencies are likely to remain under pressure. Now all attention is on whether Bitcoin can hold above the $100,000 support level. If it fails, further losses could drag the market lower. Market Sentiment Update The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 40 (Neutral), but this could quickly swing toward “Fear” if geopolitical tensions intensify in the coming days.

2025-06-22T13:40:49,"Texas Establishes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with Governor’s Approval","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), officially creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The new fund will hold Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset for the state, making Texas the first U.S. state to commit public funds to a dedicated Bitcoin treasury. The reserve will operate independently of the state’s general treasury system and is designed to bolster Texas’ financial resilience. According to the bill, it will also serve as a hedge against inflation. Only digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion are eligible for inclusion—an exclusive criterion that, for now, only Bitcoin satisfies. Administration of the fund will fall under the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, with guidance from a three-member advisory committee composed of crypto investment professionals. The fund may grow not only through direct Bitcoin purchases but also through forks, airdrops, investment returns, and public donations in cryptocurrency. A detailed performance report of the reserve will be published every two years. Texas Legislation Shields Reserve from Budget Pressures To protect the reserve from being redirected for other state expenses, Governor Abbott previously signed House Bill 4488. This bill ensures the Bitcoin reserve remains insulated from the general revenue fund, safeguarding it from shifting fiscal priorities and political changes. With this legislative framework in place, Texas joins Arizona and New Hampshire as one of only three U.S. states to establish a Bitcoin reserve law. However, Texas is the first to go a step further by allocating public funds and building a separate infrastructure for managing its Bitcoin holdings. This move signals a significant leap forward in Bitcoin’s mainstream financial adoption, particularly at the government level. Public Companies Continue Expanding Bitcoin Holdings The Texas initiative aligns with a broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption, especially among public companies. On Friday, David Bailey-founded Nakamoto Holdings secured $51.5 million in a private equity placement to increase its BTC holdings. In Europe, Paris-listed tech firm The Blockchain Group recently added 182 BTC, worth roughly $19.6 million, to its treasury, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that more organizations are embracing Bitcoin as a core asset, underscoring its growing role in both private and public financial strategy.

2025-06-22T13:35:55,"IREN: Improving Efficiency Position The Company For Growth","Summary I am bullish on IREN due to its industry-leading bitcoin mining efficiency and ability to maintain low production costs amid rising competition and energy prices. IREN’s strategic diversification into AI cloud services and HPC solutions positions it for resilient growth beyond bitcoin mining, capitalizing on higher CAGR opportunities in AI. Financially, IREN boasts strong revenue growth, robust liquidity, and a manageable debt profile, supporting continued expansion and operational flexibility. Given its undervaluation, superior revenue growth, and forward-thinking strategy, I reiterate a buy rating on IREN with significant upside potential despite sector risks. Thesis statement I am bullish on IREN Limited (NASDAQ: IREN ) driven by the improved efficiency of mining bitcoin from 16 J/TH in Q3’2024 to 15 J/TH in Q3’2025. The reason I think IREN’s mining efficiency is a major boost at the moment is because bitcoin mining is still profitable in 2025, but it’s becoming more competitive as more miners continue to join the blockchain market. For instance, Bitmain, Cannan, and MicroBT, which are the manufacturers of over 90% of global Bitcoin mining machines, are establishing a U.S base as a shield strategy against tariffs. This is one of the serious competitive aspects of the Bitcoin mining business. Given this competitiveness, in my opinion, the companies that have an efficient mining strategy are likely to maintain their profitability. It is from this angle I see IREN being a bullish stock. Now, let’s get to production efficiency. Bitcoin production cost in 2025 is up by 9% due to high energy prices and hashrate. Despite this increase, IREN has managed to maintain an efficient mining cost, which is a major driver of its profitability. MinerMag With the increase of hashrate from 5.6 EH/s in Q3’2024 to 29.4 EH/s in Q3’2025, an efficiency of 15 J/TH in the same quarter, the rise in bitcoin price contributed to its profitability from $8.6 million to $24.2 million. According to analysts’ prediction in 2025 that Bitcoin may hit $125,000 from its current ~$106,000 , this positions IREN in a better position to make profits from its efficient mining strategy, which is why I am bullish. I digress further in my explanations below why I believe IREN has a bullish potential. Company brief IREN Limited is a Bitcoin mining company that owns and operates its own data centers. The company also has alternative revenue generation from AI cloud services and high-performance computing (HPC) solutions. In November 2024, the company’s name was changed from Iris Energy Limited to IREN Limited, and it has maintained its headquarters in Sydney, Australia. Efficiency As A Significant Factor The median cost of mining a Bitcoin at the end of 2024 was $52,000 , and this cost has since risen to $64,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This cost is expected to increase by 9%, which is likely to hit an average of $70,000 by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Given this projected increase, IREN is installing over 50EH/s mining capacity by the end of June to compete favorably. Given that IREN is currently mining its Bitcoin at an efficient cost of $25,647 compared to its competitors, such as MARA at $51,877, CleanSpark, Inc. at $36, 139 and Cipher Mining at $44,385, it stands a chance for a bullish trend. MinerMag Now, here is the point. As the production cost increases, the production-efficient companies get some relief when cost-inefficient companies are strained by high production costs. As the production cost rises due to an increase in energy prices, IREN competitors face cost pressures . This highlights the importance of efficiency in the production of Bitcoins, which has driven companies such as Cipher Mining and IREN to post a double-digit score on stock gains between May and June of 2025, above Bitcoin’s modest price increase of 1.35% in the same period. Additionally, IREN is strategically positioning itself for revenue diversification as Bitcoin mining gets too competitive, with rising costs of Bitcoin mining and increasing network difficulty. IREN is diversifying in AI opportunities, such as pausing to expand mining at 50EH/s by the end of June 2025. IREN This broadening of revenue models positions IREN to a resilient business structure within its Bitcoin mining model to remain profitable. With approximately 2.1 million left to be minded, the mining business is getting too competitive and strenuous for a growth outlook. Adding competition and costs of fueling mining is driving a shift to AI opportunities. For example, when I look at IREN, despite ramping up its mining fleet, the pause at 50EH/s to focus on AI shows its preparation for other revenue generation activities. There are more AI opportunities compared to Bitcoin based on their CAGR. The mining market is estimated to have a CAGR of 10.57% between 2024 and 2035, which, compared to AI opportunity at a CAGR of 40% between 2023 and 2030, makes it reasonable for IREN to pause Bitcoin mining fleet enhancement. The demand for AI is ready for data centers, with an average of 70% demand for data center capacity. AI workloads are expected to advance by 2030, as seen with Gen AI, which is offering the fastest advanced AI use case. The demand for this advanced AI capacity is estimated to grow at a 33% CAGR between 2023 and 2030, which is why AI has more growth outlook compared to Bitcoin mining. The management of IREN and its ability to read the signs of time, like AI exodus from mining, shows its well-managed resilience, which is why I recommend a bullish position, McKinsey Financials; Q3’2025 highlight Due to the efficiency of production at 15 JT/H and 40EH/s, revenues in Q3’2025 increased by 164.8% YoY from $543 million in Q3’2024 to $148.2 million. The company’s diversification to AI opportunities saw AI cloud service generating a revenue increase of 500% from $0.6 million IN Q3’2024 to $3.6 million in Q3’2025. Adjusted EBITDA rose from $21.8 million in Q3’2024 to $83.3 million, reflecting an improvement in core business operations. For example, comparing Q3’2025 to Q3’2025, the average operating hashrate increased by 30% after Childress expansion from 22E.6 EH/s to 29EH/s. This increased Bitcoins mined in the third quarter by 12%, from 1,347 Bitcoin to 1,514 Bitcoin. On average, the price realized per Bitcoin increased by 11% from $84.3k to $93.3k. This was primarily driven by an increase in energy costs from $28.9 million to $36.5 million. This delivered a profit after tax of $24.2 million from $8.6 million in Q3’2024. The profits were also driven by an increase in Bitcoin in April and May of 2025, which rose from $76.0K to $111.0K. It indicates its resilience in efficiency and diversification, leading to profitability. Looking at the balance sheet, the company debt stands at $564.2 million due to a substantial convertible note of $322.5 million, which has a maturity period of 2029. Given that the company is pausing the extension of bitcoin mining enhancement at 50 EH/s by the end of June 2025. This me to a concern as to whether its debt-to-asset ratio is well managed. The total assets are $1,989.8 million, and its debt-to-asset is 0.28 or 28%, which is below the technology industry debt-to-asset ratio of 57.61% . This indicates that the current assets at IREN are capable of supporting its debt by a larger margin. Given the ample time the company has until its debt maturity in 2029, it indicates that it has a stable financial footing. Also, the company closed its Q3’2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $184.3 million and a total operating expense of $61,8 million. This shows that it has a liquidity coverage of 2.98, which is approximately 3x available cash reserves to operating expenses. The company is in a flexible position to finance its operations without strain. This can be seen in its ability to forecast expansion of 50 EH/s, which reduced capex by $43 million. Valuation I will value the company using Revenue YoY, and price-to-cash flows in relation to its competitors CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLSK ), MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ: CIFR ). Based on my bullish analysis that looks at IREN’s profitability and diversification into AI opportunities, I believe these metrics are the best valuation metrics at the moment. The revenue YoY shows that IREN has a high growth at 128.24% compared to its competitors, CLSK at 89.47%, MARA at 40.57%, and CIFR at -0.65%. Seeking Alpha The price-to-cash flow of all its competitors is negative. IREN P/CF is the second highest negative at -11.26, after CIFR at -13.06. Comparing IREN with CLSK at -6.92 and MARA at -6.34, they have a relatively higher P/CF ratio, which means their cash flows are higher and match the current price. However, in terms of P/CF, IREN is undervalued given that it has the strongest revenue YoY compared to its competitors, yet P/CF is valued to be low, which is why I believe the current price is not justified. Seeking Alpha These metrics confirm that IREN has a high bullish potential driven by its capacity to mine bitcoins at a minimum cost and its shift to AI opportunities, which present a bigger revenue generation. Given its EPS normalized estimate of $0.25 and its forward PE by the end of June 2025 of 82.58x, I approximate an upside of 98% from $10 to $20. This is within analysts’ estimates of between $20.30 to $33.00. Marketbeat Investment risks Bitcoin price volatility – Bitcoin is a volatile coin, and IREN faces a risk of market correction in case of a bearish move, which means a possible loss of revenues. Energy price fluctuations – Mining has become expensive due to rising energy costs. This is a risky situation for IREN if the prices keep increasing, which may reduce its profit margins further even at its existing efficiency. Technological obsolescence – By pausing the expansion of bitcoin mining machines at 50 EH/s, IREN faces a risk of revenue decline in case another company invests in an expansion that overtakes its efficiency. Conclusion The company is an ideal investment given its bitcoin mining efficiency and its preparation to mitigate mining competition by moving to AI opportunities. I am reiterating a buy entry on IREN at the current price.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796390-iren-improving-efficiency-position-the-company-for-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","IREN",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T13:30:16,"Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens","Bitcoin’s narrow price movement over the past week contradicts a much different development in the futures market. According to Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, a sharp rise in the long liquidation dominance metric could set the stage for a significant shift in sentiment that may completely wash out bears from the market. Adler shared the data in a recent post on X, accompanied by a chart showing previous points that resemble the current setup. Long Liquidation Spike Without Price Crash The dominance of long liquidations has jumped from 0% to +10% over the past seven days, a move that typically shows distress among bullish traders. However, what makes the current development especially noteworthy is the absence of a steep crash in Bitcoin’s price. Instead, in the just concluded week, Bitcoin held mostly within the $103,000 to $106,000 range until a recent drop, despite facing increasing pressure from long-side liquidations. Related Reading: XRP Daily RSI Trendline Breaks Down – What It Means For Price Axel Adler Jr. explained that this sustained liquidation of long positions without a full-blown price collapse indicates sustained buyer support. According to data from CryptoQuant, BTC’s long liquidations hit 2,200 BTC, the highest in the past week. Usually, a surge in long liquidations suggests that traders who were anticipating a price rally are being pushed out of their positions under pressure. The CryptoQuant chart below shows how spikes in long liquidation dominance, especially in the 15% to 20% range, have always preceded bullish reversals. According to the analyst, if this metric rises by another 5–7%, it could cause a high-probability scenario where bearish positions are washed out and flip Bitcoin’s price movements in favor of the bulls. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Large Wallets Accumulate As Retail Exits Data from Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, shows an interesting dynamic playing out among Bitcoin holders. Over the past ten days, wallets holding over 10 BTC have increased by 231 addresses, which is a 0.15% rise. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets containing between 0.001 and 10 BTC have dropped by 37,465 in the same timeframe. This trend highlights a divergence in sentiment between large and retail holders. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break? According to Santiment, the shift where whales and sharks accumulate while retail exits is a bullish combination for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market value is hovering just below $104,000 during this accumulation phase, and there could be an eventual upward breakout once retail holders begin to reenter. Image From X: Santiment Despite the underlying on-chain strength, Bitcoin’s spot price has taken a short-term hit in the past 48 hours. During this timeframe, Bitcoin’s price has slipped below support levels between $106,000 and $103,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,670, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The decline can be largely attributed to recent U.S. strikes on Iran. The U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 21-22) caused immediate risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin fell 3.2% after announcements of the strikes, much like its 6% drop during similar 2020 Iran tensions.

This event comes amidst an ongoing extensive correction in the crypto market that has sparked speculations on the viability of the current bull market run. Crypto Market Set For Rebound As China Restarts Money Supply Growth In an Open Market Operations announcement on June 20, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) stated intentions to inject RMB 161.2 billion into the economy through a seven-day reverse repo operations at a 1.40% interest rate. For context, reverse repos are short-term liquidity tools in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks with an agreement to sell them back at a later date, thereby temporarily boosting liquidity in the banking system.Interestingly, this latest injection is part of a broader monetary easing trend observed in China’s recent policy stance. Notably, on May 7, the PBOC implemented a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), a move that freed up approximately RMB 1 trillion ($138 billion) in long-term liquidity, effectively coinciding with a Bitcoin price surge above $97,000 on that day and new all-time high a few weeks after. However, unlike the RRR cut which had more enduring liquidity implications, the latest RMB 161.2 billion injection via reverse repo is designed for short-term liquidity management. Nevertheless, popular crypto analyst and key opinion leader Ted Pillows explains it is a strong indicator that China’s M2 money supply is now trending upward again after peaking in Q1 2025. Generally, an increase in M2 signals expanding liquidity, often viewed as a long-term bullish indicator for both traditional and digital asset markets. Considering the ongoing crypto market correction, China’s latest monetary intervention is a positive signal reinforcing the potential of bullish resurgence in the coming weeks. US Fed To Follow Suit? Following the recent announcement by the PBOC, speculation is mounting over whether the US Federal Reserve might adopt similar liquidity-boosting measures. However, according to a report by Scotsman Guide , analysts at Wells Fargo predict that the Fed is likely to maintain its quantitative tightening stance throughout 2025.At press time, the total crypto market cap is worth $3.14 trillion following a 1.48% decrease in the past day.

Bitcoin faced a sharp rejection after attempting to break above an important resistance zone. After the failed breakout, the price dropped straight into a crucial buy zone, triggering liquidations across the market. In total, over $400 million worth of long positions were wiped out in just a day. A major factor behind this recent market nervousness is the United States entering the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Analysts believe that if the situation worsens further, it could negatively impact global financial markets — whether stocks or crypto — causing a sharper decline. With fears of a potential World War III rising, investors rushed to the safety of gold and the US dollar, while riskier assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies saw heavy selloffs. Additionally, in the recent FOMC meeting, interest rates were not cut as expected. This paused the market’s momentum and dampened the optimism for a quick recovery. A bull market might take a little longer to arrive. Amid the current market uncertainty, investors are searching for a bullish spark to lift sentiment. Speculation is swirling about Bitcoin potentially surging to $200,000 or even $250,000 by the end of the year.

2025-06-22T12:43:23,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Crashes Below $101,000 As US Airstrikes Send Shockwaves Across Markets","Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,979 after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted successful strikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps As US Strikes Key Sites In Iran US President Donald Trump announced that the United States had conducted successful airstrikes targeting key nuclear installations in Iran. Markets plunged after the announcement, with BTC dropping to a low of $100,979 as traders panicked. Trump took to Truth Social to state, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. Source: TradingView BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Despite facing volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday, BTC registered an increase of 0.35% but fell 0.24% on Thursday to settle at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and settling at $103,388. The price plunged below $101,000 on Saturday as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $102,000 and settle at $102,180. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $102,558.

2025-06-22T12:07:52,"Florida man drags shady crypto trading school to court over $860K loss","A Florida man lost about $860,000 to a shady crypto trading school based in Denver, United States. According to the lawsuit, the victim claimed the trading school introduced him to a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised him life-changing rewards for his investments only to end up scamming him. In the lawsuit filed in a federal court, the victim, Brian Firestone claimed that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC), which operated in downtown Denver, was in partnership with a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners in Cherry Creek in the scheme. According to Firestone, he was first approached in December by a man named John Smith, who he said claimed to represent the trading school. Florida man sues crypto trading school after $860,000 loss According to Firestone, Smith offered to tutor him on the basics and in-depth technicals in crypto trading. He noted that Smith even offered him a gift of $500 to kickstart his learning process, one which was a ploy to eventually lure him into the elaborate scam. The trading school’s website, which is now defunct, lists its address as 1600 Lincoln St. The platform directed its users to carry out all their crypto trading services on CoinBridge, which claimed to have raised $10 million from 600 investors. According to Firestone, CoinBridge is a fake establishment masquerading as a real exchange. The lawsuit mentioned that ASITC allegedly used a method known as signal trading. According to the lawsuit, Firestone claimed that professors would message participants in the ASTIC classes at different times with clear trade instructions at different times. Students are then expected to follow these instructions, which end with them executing trades using their CoinBridge account. Firestone said that his initial $500 investment from the gift from Smith quickly rose to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his balance started reading $2 million. He didn’t hold back on his appreciation for the professor. “Professor, I must thank you,” Firestone texted Smith on Feb. 8. “My results were outstanding. Thank you for letting me in this trade today. This is so exciting!” he said. However, things started to move from good to bad for Firestone after a losing trade brought his balance back to $12,000. According to Firestone, he then wired $470,000 in cash and took a loan of $330,000 from ASITC to continue trading. He mentioned that after the influx of cash, his balance on CoinBridge read $24.5 million, until a USDT trade he carried out on March 9 failed to execute. “I can’t close it,” Firestone messaged Smith. “I ncant clpsoe it.” Firestone said it was a “system error” that caused the glitch, leading to his balance getting erased on the platform. Two days after that ordeal, he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, bringing the total to $6.6 million. However, he was not able to repay part of the loan as ASITC allegedly shut down his account on May 1. According to the suit, Firestone is accusing ASITC, CoinBridge, Smith, and platform founder Raymond Torres of fraud, racketeering, and theft. The real CointBridge Partners in Wyoming has also denied any connection to the scam. Meanwhile, over $2.1 billion has been stolen in several crypto-related incidents since the beginning of 2025, with most of the losses tied to wallet breaches and key mismanagement, according to CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu. The trend shows that hackers and malicious actors are moving from targeting platforms in code-based hacks to users. In 2024, phishing attacks accounted for over $1 billion in losses across 300 incidents, making it the most damaging method of attack in the crypto space.

Trump Wallets Offload TRUMP Tokens Hours Before US-Iran Clash","TL;DR On-chain data shared by Lookonchain shows that the Official Trump team deposited another sizeable batch of the asset to centralized exchanges yesterday. While they have done this in the past on numerous occasions, this particular transfer raises questions about inside information, as it came just hours before the US attacked Iran. The wallet linked to the #TRUMP team deposited another 3.527M $TRUMP ($32.8M) to #Binance 30 minutes ago. Since April 28, wallets linked to the #TRUMP team have deposited a total of 12.54M $TRUMP ($150.68M) to exchanges in 4 batches. https://t.co/SwzribrM5d pic.twitter.com/26IksmyHvM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2025 It was just a few months ago when TRUMP skyrocketed as the US President invited the top 220 holders to attend a special dinner event with him in the States. Naturally, people rushed in to buy the token, which doubled in value in days and exceeded $16 in late April. However, speculators started to take profits off the table, and TRUMP corrected almost immediately. Nevertheless, it remained above $10 for the next several weeks before Israel’s attacks against Iran took place last week. The past 24 hours have been particularly brutal to altcoins as the US joined Israel in attacking Iran. This is evident by the growing bitcoin dominance , and the Official Trump meme coin has not been spared. The asset has slumped by over 6% on a daily scale and now trades well below $9. This is why many X users questioned whether the team was aware of what was to take place just hours after they transferred more than $32 million worth of TRUMP to Binance. It’s worth noting that the US President confirmed the attacks at 00:50 BST (19:50 local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social, which was several hours after the transfers to Binance.

2025-06-22T11:45:19,"US Dollar Now Effectively Replaced As World’s Reserve Currency by This Asset, According to Black Swan Author Nassim Taleb","Economist and best-selling author Nassim Taleb says a single asset has overtaken the US dollar’s position as the world’s de facto reserve currency. In a new interview with Bloomberg, the Black Swan author says that the US dollar has lost its status as a reliable safe-haven asset, noting that people prefer to invest in the stock market rather than hold a currency that declines in value over time. He also says that America’s sweeping sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine marked the beginning of the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. According to Taleb, gold is now the world’s reserve currency, highlighting that the dollar’s credibility eroded after America and its allies weaponized the USD. “That would end up being reflected in stocks, the slow decline of the dollar, and effectively, there’s a second risk. The first one is the deficit, the second one is effectively that the dollar is losing its status as a reserve currency… You can see the accumulation of gold in the reserves and the behavior of gold over the past 12 months. And it didn’t start with Trump’s policies. Of course, it started with Biden when he froze the accounts of people connected to Putin, and of course, thinking that it would be limited there, but people not connected to Putin decided to stay away from the euro and the dollar. And gold is effectively now the reserve currency. Transactions take place in dollars and euros, usually dollars, and at the same rate, however, they get converted back into gold. And we can see that from the accumulation of reserves.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-22T11:39:00,"Kaspa Technology Praised by Experts, But Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates More Accessible Wealth Path","In the fast-shifting world of crypto, one pattern has become undeniable. Early-stage presale tokens have consistently outperformed the broader market, especially when backed by real tech, active communities, and massive potential. According to recent Live Coin Watch data, many of today’s top performers were once unknown $5 or $8 tokens. Now, a new contender is catching fire, and it’s not just talk. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the next massive mover, and momentum is accelerating faster than expected. Kaspa Made Waves, But Can It Reach the Masses? Kaspa has been a favorite in the proof-of-work crowd for its blockDAG approach and speed. Its underlying technology is impressive and solves several legacy blockchain issues, especially around scalability. However, it still requires traditional hardware to mine, which makes it less approachable for the everyday user. Despite strong developer backing, Kaspa hasn’t bridged the gap between institutional-grade innovation and widespread accessibility. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flips the script. Bitcoin Solaris Is Rewriting the Crypto Playbook Bitcoin Solaris was built on a single idea: make mining and blockchain wealth creation something anyone can participate in. From a technical angle, the project is light years ahead. At its core is a dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid approach gives BTC-S both security and scalability, delivering up to 100,000 transactions per second on the Solaris Layer with 2-second finality. But the deeper magic is in its accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S straight from their phone, laptop, or even browser. This alone has positioned BTC-S as one of the most inclusive mining ecosystems in crypto today. Key Features Driving Momentum: Dual-consensus architecture for maximum scalability and security Validator rotation and cross-layer interaction for network resilience Up to 100,000 TPS and real-time block finality Energy-efficient mining using just 0.05% of Bitcoin’s energy footprint Zero-Knowledge Proofs for optional privacy features Smart contract infrastructure built for DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and more The combination of speed, power, and accessibility is making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens right now. The Rise of Universal Mining: Wealth from Your Pocket BTC-S isn’t just about powerful infrastructure. It’s about making that power usable by anyone. Thanks to its Universal Mining model, users can mine directly from nearly any device. A smartphone? Done. A regular laptop? Easy. Even advanced miners with ASICs and GPUs are supported, with the system optimizing performance per device. Once live, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will give users access to: One-tap mining with adaptive algorithms Built-in wallet with real-time rewards tracking In-app tutorials to guide beginners Compatibility with Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web For those looking to calculate what they could earn from mining, the BTC-S mining calculator is a great starting point. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands A Community That’s Already Catching Fire More than 11,500 users have already joined the presale, and interest continues to climb. Many crypto influencers and analysts are calling it one of the best early-stage opportunities of the year. A detailed review from the Crypto Vlog breaks down why this project is drawing attention across the ecosystem, from retail holders to serious mining enthusiasts. What makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out isn’t just hype. It’s transparency. The project has already passed audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring the underlying technology is secure and trustworthy. The team also maintains an active presence through platforms like Telegram and X , where updates and community conversations continue to grow daily. Why This Presale Is a Big Deal The Bitcoin Solaris presale is already in its eighth phase and gaining serious traction. The price is currently $8, with the next jump coming soon. The launch price is set at $20, offering a potential return of 150 percent for early participants. Time is limited, though. With the launch set for July 31, only around six weeks remain before the window closes. This is not just a typical token sale. It’s shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history. With over $5 million raised and thousands already onboard, it’s hard to ignore the momentum. To get involved or learn more, check out Bitcoin Solaris . A Technical Core That Backs the Hype What sets BTC-S apart is that the performance isn’t just talk. Its reward distribution system is finely tuned, offering structured incentives that prioritize long-term contribution and network health. BTC-S reward distribution structure: 40 percent goes to PoW miners 25 percent to Solaris Layer validators 20 percent to stakeholders 10 percent reserved for development 5 percent power community incentives Mining rewards are calculated based on device type, contribution score, and time-weighted participation, ensuring fairness and decentralization. These mechanics are why many are calling it a project built not only to last but to empower. Final Thoughts: Is This the Wealth Gateway You’ve Been Waiting For? Bitcoin Solaris is more than a coin. It’s a gateway into a new era of wealth creation, one that doesn’t care if you’re holding a $3,000 rig or a budget smartphone. While other projects chase high-speed numbers or institutional validation, BTC-S is quietly building something for the people. If you’re looking to enter crypto with real utility, real earning potential, and real accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris might just be your moment.

2025-06-22T11:31:18,"Samson Mow eyes Europe Bitcoin expansion after France invite","Jan3 founder Samson Mow is weighing in on advocating for Bitcoin in Europe after a promising discussion with pro-Bitcoin French legislator Sarah Knafo. In a Saturday X post , he commented: “It was great to meet Knafo Sarah, and she’s invited us to visit France! Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe!” Samson Mow discussed Bitcoin agenda with Sarah Knafo At the BTC Prague event this week, Mow met with a member of the European Parliament, Sarah Knafo, and discussed how his company could help craft Bitcoin-forward policies in France and develop a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Knafo even described their meeting as excellent and acknowledged Mow for his advisory role to the president of El Salvador and many other leaders. She added that France has to step up and tackle these issues head-on, hinting at more Bitcoin advocacy in the future. According to Knafo, she invited Mow and his team to France. She also met with Strategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, who she found to be “visionary and ambitious.” France has been actively expanding its involvement with crypto. Most recently, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 BTC for €60.2 million, about $68.7 million, raising its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, in March, Bpifrance committed €25 million, equal to about $27 million , to cryptocurrency investments to support France’s blockchain and crypto innovation. Revolut , a European neobank with crypto support, also announced plans to invest over $1.1 billion in France and pursue a local banking license in May. It is also preparing to add at least 200 more people within three years. Knafo confirmed that more crypto projects will soon be in Europe and the country. So far, about 10% of French citizens hold crypto assets, and roughly 33% of French people plan to acquire crypto assets in 2025. However, France still lags behind compared to adoption rates in the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), and Belgium (17%). However, France has seen a 10-point increase in public interest, reaching 33%. This puts it just behind Italy, which leads at 37%. Europe’s crypto adoption is still low compared to other countries worldwide Some crypto executives have expressed concerns over Europe’s lower crypto adoption than the rest of the world. In March, Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, stated that European corporate adoption remains limited. Fabrega argued that the investors are reluctant to join the crypto community because of underlying structural barriers, including regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional endorsement, and an underdeveloped market. He added, “Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Nonetheless, the European Union has become more open to crypto assets, first proposing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), a digital token regulatory framework, in September 2020, adopting it in May 2023, and fully implementing it in December 2024.

2025-06-22T11:24:13,"Bitcoin Dominance Skyrockets as ETH and Other Altcoins Plummet","Bitcoin’s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours after the US attacked multiple Iranian nuclear sites, and the asset plunged to a multi-week low. The altcoins have posted even more notable price declines, which is evident from the growing BTC dominance. Bitcoin Tries to Recover The business week began on a different note as the primary cryptocurrency shot from under $105,000 to $109,000 by Tuesday. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection that pushed it south hard as the tension in the Middle East continued to rage on. In a matter of hours, BTC dumped to $103,500 before the bulls initiated an impressive leg up that drove the asset higher by around $3,000. Nevertheless, the overall negative market sentiment continued , and bitcoin started to lose value once again in the following days. The culmination came earlier today as the US launched “successful” attacks against multiple nuclear sites in Iran, as described by the POTUS. Moreover, Trump warned that there will be more violent strikes if Iran decides to retaliate in any form. Bitcoin’s price tumbled below $101,000 for the first time in almost three weeks. However, it remained within a six-digit price territory and has recovered to $102,500 as of now. Its market cap is down to $2.040 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has skyrocketed to almost 63% as most bleed out. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Deep in Red The rising BTC dominance in times when the cryptocurrency’s price is dropping means only one thing – the alts have it even worse. Interestingly, it’s not just the lower caps that are suffering badly. Ethereum, the largest of the bunch, has dumped by over 7% in the past 24 hours and is close to breaking below $2,200. Recall that ETH stood tall close to $2,800 just until a week ago. Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and LINK are also deep in the red from the bigger alts. Even more painful declines come from VIRTUAL, APT, INJ, TIA, TAO, SEI, JUP, FET, and PEPE, as all of them are down by double-digits on a daily scale. These developments are only supporting a recent report, which claimed that those hoping for an altseason are relying mostly on “ wishful thinking ” rather than any hard data.
