2025-06-22T12:58:24,"Exclusive Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Bitcoin Dream Isn’t Dead Yet Despite Market Crash","The post Exclusive Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Bitcoin Dream Isn’t Dead Yet Despite Market Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just witnessed another wild 24 hours. Bitcoin faced a sharp rejection after attempting to break above an important resistance zone. After the failed breakout, the price dropped straight into a crucial buy zone, triggering liquidations across the market. In total, over $400 million worth of long positions were wiped out in just a day. A major factor behind this recent market nervousness is the United States entering the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Analysts believe that if the situation worsens further, it could negatively impact global financial markets — whether stocks or crypto — causing a sharper decline. With fears of a potential World War III rising, investors rushed to the safety of gold and the US dollar, while riskier assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies saw heavy selloffs. Additionally, in the recent FOMC meeting, interest rates were not cut as expected. This paused the market’s momentum and dampened the optimism for a quick recovery. A bull market might take a little longer to arrive. Amid the current market uncertainty, investors are searching for a bullish spark to lift sentiment. Speculation is swirling about Bitcoin potentially surging to $200,000 or even $250,000 by the end of the year. In an interview with Coinpedia, Jetking, an Indian company accumulating Bitcoin from 2022 said, “We predict Bitcoin prices to be in the range of $ 140000-150000 by year end.” Bitcoin Short-Term Price Action: Bitcoin price briefly touched ₹101,000, then attempted a small recovery. However, overall market sentiment remains weak, with lower volumes compared to Friday. Experts are now closely watching the ₹100,000 support level — a crucial point that needs to hold to avoid a deeper correction. It is struggling to break past the ₹102,600 resistance zone. A recovery is possible if Bitcoin manages to reclaim this level, but so far, that hasn’t happened. If the price fails to hold ₹100,000, another drop could follow, possibly with reduced trading volumes.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/exclusive-bitcoin-price-prediction-150k-bitcoin-dream-isnt-dead-yet-despite-market-crash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T12:43:23,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Crashes Below $101,000 As US Airstrikes Send Shockwaves Across Markets","Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,979 after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted successful strikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps As US Strikes Key Sites In Iran US President Donald Trump announced that the United States had conducted successful airstrikes targeting key nuclear installations in Iran. Markets plunged after the announcement, with BTC dropping to a low of $100,979 as traders panicked. Trump took to Truth Social to state, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. Source: TradingView BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Despite facing volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday, BTC registered an increase of 0.35% but fell 0.24% on Thursday to settle at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and settling at $103,388. The price plunged below $101,000 on Saturday as market sentiment worsened.

In security, a pro-Israel group hacked Iran’s largest exchange Nobitex for $90 million, and a breach exposing 16 billion credentials raised serious risks of theft and fraud. Let’s find out more. Business BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), Spain’s second-largest bank, is advising its wealthy clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolio towards Bitcoin and Ethereum. Eric Trump has distanced himself from Tron’s reported plans for a US public listing, clarifying that while he is a strong supporter of Justin Sun, he has no official involvement in the blockchain network’s market debut. Web3: Bubblemaps, a growing name in on-chain intelligence and blockchain visualization, has announced its latest integration , which will be partnering with The Open Network (TON), the blockchain that powers Telegram’s ecosystem of crypto apps and services.

According to the lawsuit, the victim claimed the trading school introduced him to a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised him life-changing rewards for his investments only to end up scamming him. In the lawsuit filed in a federal court, the victim, Brian Firestone claimed that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC), which operated in downtown Denver, was in partnership with a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners in Cherry Creek in the scheme. According to Firestone, he was first approached in December by a man named John Smith, who he said claimed to represent the trading school. Florida man sues crypto trading school after $860,000 loss According to Firestone, Smith offered to tutor him on the basics and in-depth technicals in crypto trading. He noted that Smith even offered him a gift of $500 to kickstart his learning process, one which was a ploy to eventually lure him into the elaborate scam. The trading school’s website, which is now defunct, lists its address as 1600 Lincoln St. The platform directed its users to carry out all their crypto trading services on CoinBridge, which claimed to have raised $10 million from 600 investors. According to Firestone, CoinBridge is a fake establishment masquerading as a real exchange. The lawsuit mentioned that ASITC allegedly used a method known as signal trading. According to the lawsuit, Firestone claimed that professors would message participants in the ASTIC classes at different times with clear trade instructions at different times. Students are then expected to follow these instructions, which end with them executing trades using their CoinBridge account. Firestone said that his initial $500 investment from the gift from Smith quickly rose to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his balance started reading $2 million. He didn’t hold back on his appreciation for the professor. “Professor, I must thank you,” Firestone texted Smith on Feb. 8. “My results were outstanding. Thank you for letting me in this trade today. This is so exciting!” he said. However, things started to move from good to bad for Firestone after a losing trade brought his balance back to $12,000. According to Firestone, he then wired $470,000 in cash and took a loan of $330,000 from ASITC to continue trading. He mentioned that after the influx of cash, his balance on CoinBridge read $24.5 million, until a USDT trade he carried out on March 9 failed to execute. “I can’t close it,” Firestone messaged Smith. “I ncant clpsoe it.” Firestone said it was a “system error” that caused the glitch, leading to his balance getting erased on the platform. Two days after that ordeal, he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, bringing the total to $6.6 million. However, he was not able to repay part of the loan as ASITC allegedly shut down his account on May 1. According to the suit, Firestone is accusing ASITC, CoinBridge, Smith, and platform founder Raymond Torres of fraud, racketeering, and theft. The real CointBridge Partners in Wyoming has also denied any connection to the scam. Meanwhile, over $2.1 billion has been stolen in several crypto-related incidents since the beginning of 2025, with most of the losses tied to wallet breaches and key mismanagement, according to CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu. The trend shows that hackers and malicious actors are moving from targeting platforms in code-based hacks to users. In 2024, phishing attacks accounted for over $1 billion in losses across 300 incidents, making it the most damaging method of attack in the crypto space.

Trump Wallets Offload TRUMP Tokens Hours Before US-Iran Clash","TL;DR On-chain data shared by Lookonchain shows that the Official Trump team deposited another sizeable batch of the asset to centralized exchanges yesterday. While they have done this in the past on numerous occasions, this particular transfer raises questions about inside information, as it came just hours before the US attacked Iran. The wallet linked to the #TRUMP team deposited another 3.527M $TRUMP ($32.8M) to #Binance 30 minutes ago. Since April 28, wallets linked to the #TRUMP team have deposited a total of 12.54M $TRUMP ($150.68M) to exchanges in 4 batches. https://t.co/SwzribrM5d pic.twitter.com/26IksmyHvM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2025 It was just a few months ago when TRUMP skyrocketed as the US President invited the top 220 holders to attend a special dinner event with him in the States. Naturally, people rushed in to buy the token, which doubled in value in days and exceeded $16 in late April. However, speculators started to take profits off the table, and TRUMP corrected almost immediately. Nevertheless, it remained above $10 for the next several weeks before Israel’s attacks against Iran took place last week. The past 24 hours have been particularly brutal to altcoins as the US joined Israel in attacking Iran. This is evident by the growing bitcoin dominance , and the Official Trump meme coin has not been spared. The asset has slumped by over 6% on a daily scale and now trades well below $9. This is why many X users questioned whether the team was aware of what was to take place just hours after they transferred more than $32 million worth of TRUMP to Binance. It’s worth noting that the US President confirmed the attacks at 00:50 BST (19:50 local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social, which was several hours after the transfers to Binance.

2025-06-22T11:45:19,"US Dollar Now Effectively Replaced As World’s Reserve Currency by This Asset, According to Black Swan Author Nassim Taleb","Economist and best-selling author Nassim Taleb says a single asset has overtaken the US dollar’s position as the world’s de facto reserve currency. In a new interview with Bloomberg, the Black Swan author says that the US dollar has lost its status as a reliable safe-haven asset, noting that people prefer to invest in the stock market rather than hold a currency that declines in value over time. He also says that America’s sweeping sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine marked the beginning of the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. According to Taleb, gold is now the world’s reserve currency, highlighting that the dollar’s credibility eroded after America and its allies weaponized the USD. “That would end up being reflected in stocks, the slow decline of the dollar, and effectively, there’s a second risk. The first one is the deficit, the second one is effectively that the dollar is losing its status as a reserve currency… You can see the accumulation of gold in the reserves and the behavior of gold over the past 12 months. And it didn’t start with Trump’s policies. Of course, it started with Biden when he froze the accounts of people connected to Putin, and of course, thinking that it would be limited there, but people not connected to Putin decided to stay away from the euro and the dollar. And gold is effectively now the reserve currency. Transactions take place in dollars and euros, usually dollars, and at the same rate, however, they get converted back into gold.

2025-06-22T11:39:00,"Kaspa Technology Praised by Experts, But Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates More Accessible Wealth Path","In the fast-shifting world of crypto, one pattern has become undeniable. Early-stage presale tokens have consistently outperformed the broader market, especially when backed by real tech, active communities, and massive potential. According to recent Live Coin Watch data, many of today’s top performers were once unknown $5 or $8 tokens. Now, a new contender is catching fire, and it’s not just talk. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the next massive mover, and momentum is accelerating faster than expected. Kaspa Made Waves, But Can It Reach the Masses? Kaspa has been a favorite in the proof-of-work crowd for its blockDAG approach and speed. Its underlying technology is impressive and solves several legacy blockchain issues, especially around scalability. However, it still requires traditional hardware to mine, which makes it less approachable for the everyday user. Despite strong developer backing, Kaspa hasn’t bridged the gap between institutional-grade innovation and widespread accessibility. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flips the script. Bitcoin Solaris Is Rewriting the Crypto Playbook Bitcoin Solaris was built on a single idea: make mining and blockchain wealth creation something anyone can participate in. From a technical angle, the project is light years ahead. At its core is a dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid approach gives BTC-S both security and scalability, delivering up to 100,000 transactions per second on the Solaris Layer with 2-second finality. But the deeper magic is in its accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S straight from their phone, laptop, or even browser. This alone has positioned BTC-S as one of the most inclusive mining ecosystems in crypto today. Key Features Driving Momentum: Dual-consensus architecture for maximum scalability and security Validator rotation and cross-layer interaction for network resilience Up to 100,000 TPS and real-time block finality Energy-efficient mining using just 0.05% of Bitcoin’s energy footprint Zero-Knowledge Proofs for optional privacy features Smart contract infrastructure built for DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and more The combination of speed, power, and accessibility is making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens right now. The Rise of Universal Mining: Wealth from Your Pocket BTC-S isn’t just about powerful infrastructure. It’s about making that power usable by anyone. Thanks to its Universal Mining model, users can mine directly from nearly any device. A smartphone? Done. A regular laptop? Easy. Even advanced miners with ASICs and GPUs are supported, with the system optimizing performance per device. Once live, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will give users access to: One-tap mining with adaptive algorithms Built-in wallet with real-time rewards tracking In-app tutorials to guide beginners Compatibility with Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web For those looking to calculate what they could earn from mining, the BTC-S mining calculator is a great starting point. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands A Community That’s Already Catching Fire More than 11,500 users have already joined the presale, and interest continues to climb. Many crypto influencers and analysts are calling it one of the best early-stage opportunities of the year. A detailed review from the Crypto Vlog breaks down why this project is drawing attention across the ecosystem, from retail holders to serious mining enthusiasts. What makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out isn’t just hype. It’s transparency. The project has already passed audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring the underlying technology is secure and trustworthy. The team also maintains an active presence through platforms like Telegram and X , where updates and community conversations continue to grow daily. Why This Presale Is a Big Deal The Bitcoin Solaris presale is already in its eighth phase and gaining serious traction. The price is currently $8, with the next jump coming soon. The launch price is set at $20, offering a potential return of 150 percent for early participants. Time is limited, though. With the launch set for July 31, only around six weeks remain before the window closes. This is not just a typical token sale. It’s shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history. With over $5 million raised and thousands already onboard, it’s hard to ignore the momentum. To get involved or learn more, check out Bitcoin Solaris . A Technical Core That Backs the Hype What sets BTC-S apart is that the performance isn’t just talk. Its reward distribution system is finely tuned, offering structured incentives that prioritize long-term contribution and network health. BTC-S reward distribution structure: 40 percent goes to PoW miners 25 percent to Solaris Layer validators 20 percent to stakeholders 10 percent reserved for development 5 percent power community incentives Mining rewards are calculated based on device type, contribution score, and time-weighted participation, ensuring fairness and decentralization. These mechanics are why many are calling it a project built not only to last but to empower. Final Thoughts: Is This the Wealth Gateway You’ve Been Waiting For? Bitcoin Solaris is more than a coin. It’s a gateway into a new era of wealth creation, one that doesn’t care if you’re holding a $3,000 rig or a budget smartphone. While other projects chase high-speed numbers or institutional validation, BTC-S is quietly building something for the people. If you’re looking to enter crypto with real utility, real earning potential, and real accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris might just be your moment.

In a Saturday X post , he commented: “It was great to meet Knafo Sarah, and she’s invited us to visit France! Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe!” Samson Mow discussed Bitcoin agenda with Sarah Knafo At the BTC Prague event this week, Mow met with a member of the European Parliament, Sarah Knafo, and discussed how his company could help craft Bitcoin-forward policies in France and develop a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Knafo even described their meeting as excellent and acknowledged Mow for his advisory role to the president of El Salvador and many other leaders. She added that France has to step up and tackle these issues head-on, hinting at more Bitcoin advocacy in the future. According to Knafo, she invited Mow and his team to France. She also met with Strategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, who she found to be “visionary and ambitious.” France has been actively expanding its involvement with crypto. Most recently, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 BTC for €60.2 million, about $68.7 million, raising its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, in March, Bpifrance committed €25 million, equal to about $27 million , to cryptocurrency investments to support France’s blockchain and crypto innovation. Revolut , a European neobank with crypto support, also announced plans to invest over $1.1 billion in France and pursue a local banking license in May. It is also preparing to add at least 200 more people within three years. Knafo confirmed that more crypto projects will soon be in Europe and the country. So far, about 10% of French citizens hold crypto assets, and roughly 33% of French people plan to acquire crypto assets in 2025. However, France still lags behind compared to adoption rates in the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), and Belgium (17%). However, France has seen a 10-point increase in public interest, reaching 33%. This puts it just behind Italy, which leads at 37%. Europe’s crypto adoption is still low compared to other countries worldwide Some crypto executives have expressed concerns over Europe’s lower crypto adoption than the rest of the world. In March, Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, stated that European corporate adoption remains limited. Fabrega argued that the investors are reluctant to join the crypto community because of underlying structural barriers, including regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional endorsement, and an underdeveloped market. He added, “Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Nonetheless, the European Union has become more open to crypto assets, first proposing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), a digital token regulatory framework, in September 2020, adopting it in May 2023, and fully implementing it in December 2024.

2025-06-22T11:24:13,"Bitcoin Dominance Skyrockets as ETH and Other Altcoins Plummet","Bitcoin’s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours after the US attacked multiple Iranian nuclear sites, and the asset plunged to a multi-week low. The altcoins have posted even more notable price declines, which is evident from the growing BTC dominance. Bitcoin Tries to Recover The business week began on a different note as the primary cryptocurrency shot from under $105,000 to $109,000 by Tuesday. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection that pushed it south hard as the tension in the Middle East continued to rage on. In a matter of hours, BTC dumped to $103,500 before the bulls initiated an impressive leg up that drove the asset higher by around $3,000. Nevertheless, the overall negative market sentiment continued , and bitcoin started to lose value once again in the following days. The culmination came earlier today as the US launched “successful” attacks against multiple nuclear sites in Iran, as described by the POTUS. Moreover, Trump warned that there will be more violent strikes if Iran decides to retaliate in any form. Bitcoin’s price tumbled below $101,000 for the first time in almost three weeks. However, it remained within a six-digit price territory and has recovered to $102,500 as of now. Its market cap is down to $2.040 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has skyrocketed to almost 63% as most bleed out. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Deep in Red The rising BTC dominance in times when the cryptocurrency’s price is dropping means only one thing – the alts have it even worse. Interestingly, it’s not just the lower caps that are suffering badly. Ethereum, the largest of the bunch, has dumped by over 7% in the past 24 hours and is close to breaking below $2,200. Recall that ETH stood tall close to $2,800 just until a week ago. Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and LINK are also deep in the red from the bigger alts. Even more painful declines come from VIRTUAL, APT, INJ, TIA, TAO, SEI, JUP, FET, and PEPE, as all of them are down by double-digits on a daily scale. These developments are only supporting a recent report, which claimed that those hoping for an altseason are relying mostly on “ wishful thinking ” rather than any hard data.

Bitcoin dropped to an intraday low of around $101,000, causing a considerable uptick in liquidated positions. Bitcoin Price Dips to $101,000 As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s price dipped to an intraday low of $101,000. It has since recovered a little bit and trades at $102,500 at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView That said, the volatiltity remains enhanced, which has resulted in a whopping $700 million worth of liquidated positions across derivatives markets. Data from CoinGlass shows that this represents an increase of more than 55% compared to yesterday’s levels, attesting to the uncertainty of the ongoing situation. The turmoil is largely caused by the US decision to strike Iran earlier today, despite Donald Trump saying that he will take two weeks to decide on future moves, just a few days ago. Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, also started making preparations for the possibility the conflict might spread to their territory in a clear sign of escalation. The same is true for Saudi Arabia. Altcoins Deep in the Red The declines spread across altcoin markets as well, which took even bigger of a beating.

The US launched an attack on Iran, bombing three nuclear enrichment sites. Bitcoin declined 7.5% amid growing fears over the Israel-Iran war escalation. The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive selloff last week amid growing fears of war escalation. Bitcoin and other top cryptos’ prices pulled back following rumors that the US may get involved and attack Iran over claims of the Asian country’s illegal nuclear enrichment. The rumors became reality early Sunday morning when the US launched an attack on Iran, bombing three of the country’s major nuclear sites.

2025-06-22T10:38:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Will Outperform Ethereum’s 92,000% Growth History","Ethereum’s rise from under a dollar to over $4,000 became one of the most talked-about investment stories in crypto. The 92,000% return was real — but it took years to develop, with slow adoption, infrastructure delays, and high user friction along the way. Bitcoin Solaris is operating on a much tighter timeline. Token price has already moved from $5 to $8 during the presale. Over $5 million has been raised. More than 11,500 investors are already in. Unlike Ethereum in its first phase, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t waiting to deliver function — it’s doing it now. Utility Comes First — and It Pays Immediately With the Solaris Nova App, mining is no longer limited to people with specialized rigs or locked capital. Anyone with a compatible smartphone can mine BTC-S using idle storage and CPU — and start earning in minutes. This is protocol-level mobile mining, not outsourced compute or simulated rewards. Returns during beta already exceeded many staking platforms. There are no hardware barriers, no staking lockups, and no technical complexity. The app is live, and it’s growing in user base as more people realize they can earn simply by participating. The protocol’s infrastructure has passed independent audit by Freshcoins , while core contracts have been verified by Cyberscope . The development team has completed full KYC verification , establishing trust ahead of launch. Analyst Coverage Confirms Early Momentum Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention for the right reasons. In a recent Crypto Vlog review , the project was praised for delivering actual results at the presale stage — a rarity in the current market. Analysts are watching early performance metrics, not just the roadmap. More importantly, users are actively engaging with the network, mining with mobile devices and earning before any centralized exchange listing. While other early projects ask investors to wait for value, Bitcoin Solaris is distributing it from the start. Supply Is Fixed, Demand Is Active, and Pricing Is Still Low Bitcoin Solaris is capped at 21 million tokens. Just 4.2 million are in the presale. No emissions. No delayed unlocks. No backdoor allocations. Supply is clean and predictable — and every token already has a function. BTC-S is used for transaction fees, for mining rewards, and inside the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — which is live and running now. Every registered user gets one free spin per day. No token required. Just log in, spin, and collect if you win. For buyers, the casino unlocks reward tiers based on purchase size. Spend $250, and you access bigger spins. Spend $2,500, and you’re in for draws worth up to 0.5 BTC. It’s fast, automatic, and designed to keep tokens circulating instead of sitting idle. The token will also power the Mining Power Marketplace, now under construction. There, users will rent and monetize excess compute power on-chain. Supply meets demand, directly — no third parties needed. Products Are Live and In Use Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising a future product — it’s already operational. The Nova App is doing what it’s supposed to. People are mining. The Casino is running every day and pushing tokens back into circulation. The Marketplace is being built now — not promised later. Wallet upgrades are on the schedule, testnet is close, and the dev suite is nearly wrapped. None of this is staged for marketing — it’s work in progress, backed by actual timelines, not placeholder graphics on a pitch deck. Bitcoin Solaris is producing returns, distributing access, and expanding adoption before most altcoins even finish their whitepapers. Price momentum is already building inside the presale. Phase 8 is open. Supply is limited. And for serious investors, this may be the last cycle where early-stage, real-utility gains are still within reach.

2025-06-22T10:32:57,"Market Roundup: How Major Cryptos Moved This Week","This week in crypto brought a blend of resilience and hesitation across major assets. Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

2025-06-22T10:32:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Already Down, Iran Attacks Send BTC Price to $102,760 – Buy the Dip?","Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped sharply as geopolitical tensions rise, down to $102,760 as risk assets sell off. The decline follows a major escalation in the Middle East where US military forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, expanding the Israel-Iran conflict. This geopolitical shock triggered immediate market reactions with investors moving into traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Bitcoin, seen as a speculative asset during times of high volatility, fell 9% from its monthly high of $111,800 to $101,053. Bitcoin sold off all day & made up more than half of its losses in the last 30 minutes. Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is at $102,777 with over $47 billion in daily volume. The risk-off tone intensified after Iranian officials condemned the strikes and threatened retaliation. Iran’s Foreign Minister called for an emergency UN meeting, while Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a situation “getting out of control”. This sent equities and digital assets into a tailspin with BTC leading the way. Bitcoin Traders Reprice Risk as Bitcoin Falls The US strikes have deepened global fears of a wider war involving Israel, the US, and Iran. As tensions rose, Israel closed its airspace, Iran threatened key military and nuclear sites in the region and media reports emerged of bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles used in the operation. Israel closes airspace after US attack on Iranian targets; land crossings with Egypt, Jordan remain open – Airports Authority https://t.co/2zHClVYd9v pic.twitter.com/csMtu5kNFC — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) June 22, 2025 While the IAEA confirmed no radiation leaks, the psychological impact was big. Fears of disruption to global trade, energy markets and long-term regional security sent traders running. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge has again been called into question as it’s behaving like a risk asset during times of global stress. Monthly Drop: ~8.93% from $111,800 to $102,438 Weekly Loss: Over 2% and still falling Market Cap: $2.04 trillion Circulating Supply: 19.88 million BTC Former President Donald Trump’s comments saying the strikes were a “big success” only added to the fears of further escalation. With diplomacy stalled and Iran warning of “consequences forever” the crypto market is uncertain. Unless the political situation stabilizes, Bitcoin will likely continue to underperform as traders reduce risk. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Still Cautionary From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish. The 2-hour chart shows price action stuck in a descending channel with lower highs and lower lows. BTC failed to retest $103,932—the 50-period EMA which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A series of small candles at $102,900 indicates indecision, but no bullish reversal patterns, such as a morning star or three white soldiers, have formed to change the trend. Momentum is weak with the MACD signal lines flatlining below zero and the histogram not recovering. BTC did briefly touch support at $101,478 before bouncing with a long lower wick, so buyers are defending that level for now. Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: At $102,900 on bearish confirmation (e.g. shooting star or bearish engulfing) Stop-Loss: Above $104,100 Target 1: $101,478 Target 2: $100,451 Until price breaks above $104,031 and out of the descending channel the short-term is bearish. Any bounce is likely corrective not a reversal. Conclusion Bitcoin’s drop to $102,760 is a sign of investors reducing risk in the Middle East chaos. With macro headwinds getting stronger and no technical confirmation of a bottom, traders should be cautious. A true “buy the dip” opportunity may require a ceasefire or a confirmed break above resistance.

Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference on Saturday, Saylor’s keynote address highlighted both the evolving global crypto environment and his unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years,” Saylor told the crowd. “It’s a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” This bold forecast far exceeds his previous estimate from the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he projected Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045 . The shift, Saylor explained, stems from unforeseen global developments that have significantly strengthened BTC’s narrative over the past year. “A Sea Change in Politics” and Surging Adoption Saylor credited a “sea change” in geopolitical sentiment and U.S. policy as key reasons for his updated outlook. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary,” he said, pointing to the Biden administration’s surprising embrace of BTC and regulatory momentum in Congress. “We didn’t think the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said. “We didn’t think we’d get a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” The Strategy founder cited three major U.S. legislative efforts—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act—as evidence of this changing tide. He emphasized that several U.S. states are also warming up to BTC, reflecting a broader shift in regulatory sentiment that “nobody guessed” just a year ago. Saylor, who has famously supported BTC through market highs and lows, said Donald Trump’s return to the White House further catalyzed this shift, boosting institutional confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Saylor’s renewed optimism comes as Strategy recently added another $1 billion in BTC to its holdings, bringing its total to 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025. However, questions remain about how and where this vast reserve is stored. While the firm has not revealed its custody arrangements, Saylor has publicly rejected calls to provide proof-of-reserves, citing security concerns. His previous dismissal of self-custody also drew criticism from the Bitcoin community—though he softened his stance in late 2024, saying he supported the approach “for those willing and able.” The post Michael Saylor Predicts $21 Million Bitcoin Price by 2046, Here’s Why appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-predicts-21-million-bitcoin-price-by-2046-heres-why/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Michael Saylor|Bitcoin price prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T10:19:45,"Analyst sets date when Bitcoin could crash to $80,000","A trading analyst has warned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could lose its $100,000 support and face deeper losses in the coming months if the bearish sentiment continues. In particular, Master Ananda’s analysis indicated that a decisive break below $100,000 could open the door to a drop toward the $88,888 and $82,500 range, he explained in a TradingView post on June 22. According to the analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels on the daily chart suggest that if Bitcoin falls through $100,000, it could quickly slide to around $88,000 at the 0.618 level, and potentially to $80,000 at the 0.786 level, areas where demand has appeared before. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView The analyst noted that a rapid selloff could follow without buyer support at these levels. Interestingly, this bearish setup depends on whether Bitcoin can hold above $100,000, which it has managed so far. If it does, a strong rebound is still the most likely outcome. The outlook also suggested that a quick drop to $80,000 would probably be short-lived before the uptrend resumes. The next two to three days will be crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin stays supported or faces further losses. If $100,000 fails, a move toward the $80,000 area might be achievable by early October. Bitcoin enters major demand zone Meanwhile, pseudonymous crypto analyst BitBull suggested in an X post on June 22 that the current bearish mood might be a healthy reset for Bitcoin. According to BitBull , Bitcoin is testing a major demand zone between $100,000 and $103,500, where whales have been actively accumulating. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: BitBull He highlighted this price range as a key area of interest, as it is a strong support floor for the cryptocurrency. Despite fears and an “everything is over” narrative in the market, the expert noted that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains solid. Technicals show this demand zone has historically been a stronghold, and Bitcoin still looks promising in a broader time frame. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,284, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours and over 3% on the weekly chart. Moving ahead, bulls need to push the price back to $103,000 to open the door for a retest of $105,000. However, if Bitcoin loses the short-term support at $102,000, a drop below $100,000 looks increasingly plausible.

2025-06-22T10:10:52,"This Week in Crypto: Key Market Movers and What Comes Next","This week in crypto has been anything but quiet. From Bitcoin testing new resistance levels to Ethereum's slow grind upward and Solana’s potential rebound, key players are showing signs of life amidst recent volatility. For traders and investors alike, these movements could signal the early stages of a broader market shift—or at least a short-term window of opportunity worth watching. This market recap is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native communications agency that helps Web3 projects seize attention while the spotlight’s hot. With performance-based campaigns and live market awareness, Outset PR ensures narratives hit when momentum matters most. Bitcoin Eyes Next Resistance, Potential 11% Rally Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price currently hovers between the low hundred thousands, finding a path through a slight dip over the last month. It's nudging close to its nearest resistance level just below one hundred and fourteen thousand. If it breaks through, eyes could be on the second resistance at around one hundred twenty-two thousand, indicating an impressive climb of approximately 11% from current levels. Supported by the simple moving averages, Bitcoin's potential for growth remains hopeful, despite recent declines. As indicators like the RSI and Stochastic suggest room for upward movement, traders and enthusiasts are keenly watching the levels that could signal a more significant upward trend. Ethereum's Slow Climb: Can It Break Through the Ceiling? Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently navigating the $2367-$2804 range, aiming to reach the $3060 resistance level. With its 10-day and 100-day averages both around $2538, ETH seems to be holding steady despite recent dips. The 1-week price dipped over 5%, while the 6-month change shows a 25% drop. The nearest support is close at $2186, giving some room to recover. An upward move could push prices to challenge $3497, marking a potential 30% gain from the current resistance. Despite the current lull, bullish momentum might eventually overpower bearish sentiments if key levels are breached. Solana (SOL) Bounces Back: Bullish Hopes Amid Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently experiencing a dip, with values swinging between about $140 and $167. Recently, the coin's value declined by roughly 5.5% over the past week and nearly 15% in the last month. Despite this slump, Solana shows promise for a rebound. If buyers regain momentum, it could challenge the resistance level of $181, a potential climb of over 20% from lower levels. A further leap could drive prices towards the next marker at $209, suggesting an even more significant gain. But watch for immediate support around $127 to see if Solana can find a firm footing for the next upward push.

2025-06-22T10:00:43,"Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Previous High As MidEast Conflict Escalates – Altcoins Under Pressure","Bitcoin has officially lost the $103,600 support level following shocking geopolitical developments. The US military reportedly launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, triggering widespread panic and risk-off behavior across financial markets. The crypto space was no exception. Bitcoin, which had been holding above key support for weeks, rapidly sold off as fear gripped traders and investors alike. This breakdown marks a shift in sentiment. Bulls have lost control of short-term momentum, and the broader market now braces for a potential drop below the critical $100,000 psychological level. With no immediate signs of relief, selling pressure may persist unless strong demand emerges near range lows. Top analyst Carl Runefelt pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has just surpassed its previous high, indicating that while Bitcoin bleeds, altcoins are under even more pressure. This capital concentration in Bitcoin could be interpreted as a flight to relative safety within the crypto ecosystem, but it also highlights growing uncertainty and lack of confidence in higher-risk tokens. Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test As It Hovers Near $100K Bitcoin is at a critical juncture as it flirts with a breakdown below the psychological $100,000 mark. After weeks of holding above this level, the market is beginning to show signs of fatigue. Yet, despite the selling pressure, bulls have managed to defend the $100K threshold for now, suggesting it may be forming a new base of support. A sustained hold above this level could trigger a sharp recovery, potentially reigniting momentum toward previous highs. However, the macroeconomic backdrop remains highly volatile. Rising US Treasury yields continue to tighten liquidity conditions, while the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates adds further uncertainty. Meanwhile, escalating conflicts in the Middle East, including the recent US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, have injected fear across global markets. Bitcoin has historically responded to geopolitical risk with mixed behavior—sometimes acting as a safe haven, other times following broader market risk aversion. Adding to the complexity, Carl Runefelt recently noted that Bitcoin Dominance has just broken above its previous high. This signals that capital is concentrating on Bitcoin, while altcoins suffer heavier losses. The shift reflects growing caution in the market, with investors opting for perceived relative safety over speculative risk. Whether this capital rotation will eventually fuel another leg up for Bitcoin—or mark the start of a broader downtrend—remains to be seen in the coming days. Bitcoin has now been trading above the $100K level since early June, indicating that the price may be attempting to stabilize around this range. Yet failure to reclaim the all-time high near $112,000 continues to cap bullish momentum. If bears force a breakdown below $100K, the next support may not emerge until the $94K–$95K zone. BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Defend Critical Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,506, hovering just above the key support zone at $100,000. The chart shows BTC failing multiple times to break through the $109,300 resistance level, resulting in a gradual decline and increased selling pressure. The $103,600 area—which previously acted as support—has now been lost, confirming weakness in short-term bullish momentum. On the 3-day chart, price remains above all major moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs, signaling that the macro trend is still intact. However, volume has been decreasing as the price consolidates, suggesting hesitation among market participants. A decisive move—either a bounce from $100K or a breakdown below it—could set the tone for the next phase of Bitcoin’s trend. The price action suggests that BTC is forming a new local range between $100,000 and $109,000. If the bulls manage to hold $100K and push back above $103,600 in the coming sessions, a retest of the range highs may follow. On the flip side, a sustained move below $100K could open the door for a sharper correction toward $95,000 or even $92,000 in the short term. Market watchers are closely monitoring this level as the battle between bulls and bears intensifies.

2025-06-22T09:54:05,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as South Korea Green‑lights Spot ETFs","South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has officially submitted a roadmap to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025, marking a dramatic reversal of its previous ban on retail ETF products. Alongside this, the plan outlines a blueprint for a won-backed stablecoin ecosystem and enhanced exchange transparency and fee disclosures. 🚨 🇰🇷 South Korea’s Financial Services Commission submits roadmap to approve spot #crypto #ETFs in H2 2025. pic.twitter.com/bmkYDJKg8m — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) June 20, 2025 This shift could open regulated on-ramps for domestic investors who, until now, have lacked safe, compliant access to digital assets. As global markets, from the U.S. to the EU, race to embrace spot ETFs and stablecoins, South Korea’s move signals that its retail-hungry crypto sector may soon see a surge of institutional-grade products, bringing new opportunities for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. South Korea Charts Course for Spot Crypto ETFs and Won Stablecoins by Late 2025 South Korea’s financial regulator has filed plans to approve spot crypto ETFs and a local stablecoin market. This signals a major policy shift, targeting late 2025 implementation. The FSC submitted its roadmap supporting President Lee's pledge to lift the crypto ETF ban. Local investors could soon access regulated spot crypto products for the first time. Developing a Korean won-backed stablecoin ecosystem is also a key goal. Officials believe this can reduce capital flight and offer safer crypto choices domestically. The FSC stressed these plans remain tentative and unconfirmed. Yet they highlight a clear government move towards broader crypto market openness. South Korea boasts a huge retail crypto market, holding $75 billion late last year. Clear rules are vital for both local and global players. Historically strict, Korea banned most crypto investment products for regular people. President Lee's team is actively changing that stance now. This push includes proposed stablecoin rules, exchange transparency, and investor safeguards. It's part of a wider pro-crypto strategy. Regulators are advancing the next phase of their digital asset framework. This covers listings, fair fees, and tougher penalties for market cheats. Global pressure mounts as the US and EU race ahead with crypto ETFs and stablecoins. Korea feels the heat to stay competitive. This roadmap is a game-changer. Korean investors have long waited for regulated access to spot crypto ETFs and stablecoins. If implemented, it will bring Korea in line with global leaders like the US and EU, according to Simon Kim (CEO of Hashed, a Korean VC). https://t.co/6cRGX0uNgJ — Simon Kim (@simonkim_nft) June 5, 2025 If the roadmap holds, spot Bitcoin ETFs could launch here late next year. This opens doors for fresh institutional and retail money. Regulators walk a tightrope balancing innovation with necessary oversight. However, the momentum for change is clearly building strong. Korea plans close work with banks to oversee ETF transactions properly. They demand clear operations, strong reviews, and good risk tools. Alongside crypto rules, the FSC may extend stock exchange hours significantly. Stricter rules for public companies are also rolling out now. This green light shows that the nations beyond the US and the UK are getting receptive to the ETF offerings. And since the crypto talk has now seeped into regulations, chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This green light shows that nations beyond the US and the UK are becoming receptive to ETF offerings. And since crypto discussions have now seeped into regulations, the chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This is a critical time for such a recovery as well, since BTC price action has not inspired much confidence lately, especially with the market reeling under the intense geopolitical backdrop involving Iran and Israel. That being said, as far as ETF news is concerned, Cryptoquant reports that there has been an influx of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which has now reached 128,000 BTC, indicating that institutional interest has been restored. This, combined with the progressive news coming from the regulatory front, could help restore market balance. Best Crypto To Buy Now With South Korea poised to open its market to spot ETFs and homegrown stablecoins, investors may soon enjoy safer, regulated routes into digital assets. These reforms could attract fresh institutional capital and boost liquidity across the board, setting the stage for a renewed bull run. For those scouting the market’s next big bets, here’s the best crypto to buy now. Solaxy With the rise of ETFs, Solaxy’s smart contract layer could become a top choice for DeFi yields once institutional capital enters Korean exchanges, making it an attractive option for risk-conscious traders. Solaxy is making a splash in June 2025 with its goal of becoming the first real Layer-2 on Solana. The platform is addressing issues like congestion, slow throughput, and developer challenges on Solana. By offering a solution that enhances dApp speed and scalability, Solaxy maintains Solana’s low-cost structure while providing a smoother experience for both developers and users. Similar to Ethereum's rollups, Solaxy bundles off-chain transactions, settling them in batches on Solana.

Strong whale activity and a sharp supply reduction have made Solaxy one of the most anticipated presales of the year. Listings on major exchanges are expected soon, boosting visibility and price momentum. Renowned crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins believes Solaxy has the potential to see a 338% price increase. Due to high demand, Solaxy has extended its presale timeline, offering more investors a chance to get involved. The project remains committed to transparency, security, and sustainable growth. SUBBD South Korea’s move to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025 is set to boost regulated crypto investment opportunities.

BTC Bull Token unlocks Bitcoin rewards for holders at key price milestones. Starting at $150,000, each new reward tier opens at $50,000 increments, with the next rewards coming at $200,000 and $250,000. The calm before the bull run. 🐂🎯 pic.twitter.com/etsqZ58cIj — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 19, 2025 In addition to rewards, BTC Bull Token features a deflationary burn mechanism. At each $50,000 milestone, starting at $125,000, the token supply is permanently reduced through burns, mirroring Bitcoin’s own scarcity model. Conclusion South Korea's spot ETF roadmap and stablecoin strategy supported by the won indicates a tipping point in its policy for digital assets, with regulated access and more robust investor protection promised. It is not just a demonstration of the country's search for market maturity, but also indicates a trend towards institutional adoption and more transparent crypto regulation globally. For retail and professional investors alike, these trends provide a system under which to invest capital with more assurance. By targeting the best cryptocurrency to buy now that has structural strength in addition to growth potential, investors can set up their portfolio to profit from Korea's next crypto chapter.

In a new interview on CNBC, Lee says he’s watching for a point when the Fed could run into an “accident,” where it waits too long to address a slowing economy. Lee says he’s anticipating a potential “panic” scenario from the Fed. “There could be an accident because what we are ignoring is that housing is choking and collapsing under the weight of higher interest rates, and the labor market isn’t as strong as it appears. When we look at the ability to get a job, it’s much harder. So… there’s long and variable lags, and there could be an accident where the Fed would have to panic, so I think that’s something we have to watch in the incoming data… I think there could be a point where the Fed suddenly realizes the risks are actually to the downside for the economy weakening, and so the Fed will actually have to respond to an economy that they’re strangulating and really fighting what they believe is a supply shock inflation. So I’m a little concerned that the Fed could be late if they continue to hold.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This morning, Ethereum lost 7.7 percent of its value, falling to $2,200, while Bitcoin remained largely stable. Ethereum Price Dropped More Than Most Smaller Altcoins ETH recouped some of its losses during the day, reaching its lowest intraday price since May 9. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly saw $101,000 before trading close to its previous levels. Since traditional financial markets were closed over the weekend, cryptocurrencies were the first to react to the developments. “The market is watching geopolitical developments with concern,” said Caroline Moron, co-founder of crypto derivatives market liquidity provider Orbit Markets, noting that investors are keeping a close eye on levels of $100,000 for Bitcoin and $2,000 for Ethereum. Moron said oil prices will also be on the agenda when traditional markets reopen. Related News: Developers of Major Memecoin Transfer Their Holdings to Binance: They May Have Sold Uncertainty in the markets reached its peak when Trump announced that Iran’s facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan were hit. Trump, who stated that a “bomb-laden attack” was carried out on the Fordow facility in particular, stated that this facility was being closely monitored by the international community on suspicion of nuclear weapons production due to its uranium enrichment activities. “Uncertainty over whether the US will attack Iran has been creating selling pressure throughout the week,” said Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital Management. “However, confirmation of the attacks and the imminent resolution have led prices to find a local bottom.” According to Coinglass data, a total of $679 million worth of positions were liquidated in the crypto market in the last 24 hours. $554 million of this figure consisted of long positions and $67 million consisted of short positions. Jiang also noted that during times of geopolitical uncertainty, “Bitcoin usually leads the recovery.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-22T08:27:43,"Texas Launches State-Funded Bitcoin Reserve — What It Means for BTC Adoption?","Texas has officially joined the small but growing list of U.S. states moving toward on-chain finance, passing a bill that protects Bitcoin reserves. Key Takeaways: Texas has become the first US state to launch a publicly funded, standalone Bitcoin reserve. Other states like Florida and Arizona have backed away from similar efforts. The move follows President Trump’s executive order to establish a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on Saturday, establishing a state-funded Bitcoin reserve, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. Texas Taps Comptroller to Oversee New Bitcoin Fund The fund will be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and aims to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset class. “We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years,” said bill author Senator Charles Schwertner earlier this year. A companion bill, HB 4488, further shields the Bitcoin reserve from being raided during the state’s routine fund reallocations and secures its legal status regardless of when, or if, Bitcoin is purchased. JUST IN: Texas Governor Greg Abbott signs Bitcoin Reserve bill SB 21 into law. Texas is now the third state with a Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/2JJOc7anf4 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 21, 2025 Despite its potentially far-reaching implications, the initiative was left out of the governor’s list of top legislative priorities. Texas’ move comes as some US states abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. She called digital assets “untested investments,” effectively stopping the proposed Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Act in its tracks. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Public Companies Embrace Bitcoin as Strategic Investment Meanwhile, public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

Market participants reacted swiftly to the dip, which pushed BTC near the bottom of its month-long trading range. The reversal gained momentum as volume accelerated, leading to a strong rebound. The move coincided with a sharply worded post from James Lavish, a Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, who wrote on X : “If you are selling Bitcoin because of the possibility of the world going to war, you have absolutely no idea what you own.” The $100K–$110K range has contained price movement for nearly a month. On-chain metrics suggest a balanced market with neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation, while derivatives data indicates cautious sentiment with continued demand for downside protection. Technical Analysis Highlights A midnight push lifted BTC above $102,800 with trading volume peaking at 17,906 BTC. Between 05:57 and 06:00, BTC climbed from $102,767 to $102,912, supported by volume spikes over 150 BTC per minute. Peak recovery-period volume hit 184.24 BTC, helping drive price toward $102,990. Minute-level consolidation around $102,680–$102,720 preceded the breakout. A higher support level began forming near $102,870 as volatility decreased.

2025-06-22T07:17:39,"Bullish Crypto Bets Liquidated for $595M as U.S. Bombs Iran Nuclear Sites","Crypto bulls were blindsided Friday after the U.S. military launched airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear sites, triggering a sharp selloff and $595 million in long-position liquidations. The move, announced by former President Donald Trump, saw bombers hit Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — three of Iran’s main uranium enrichment facilities. The geopolitical jolt rattled global markets and sent crypto into a tailspin on Sunday. In the past 24 hours, 172,853 traders were liquidated, with total losses hitting $681.8 million, meaning 87% of it was from longs. Ether (ETH) traders took the biggest hit with $282 million in liquidations, followed by bitcoin (BTC) tracked trades at $151 million.Futures tracking other majors, such as SOL, XRP, and DOGE also faced heavy losses, with at least over $22 million in losses.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Prices briefly plunged before stabilizing. Bitcoin held near $102,000, while Ethereum traded just above $2,280, both down intraday but avoiding freefall.

2025-06-22T07:14:07,"Trump told Iran to “make peace” after bombing three of its nuclear sites","Trump went on national television Saturday night and demanded that Iran “make peace,” just two hours after the US military bombed three major Iranian nuclear sites. Speaking from the White House, Trump said any future strikes would be “far greater and a lot easier” if Iran retaliated. He gave no details about what kind of peace he expects or what Tehran would need to do. But the threat was clear: stop now, or get hit harder. According to reporting from Tasnim and other official statements, Iran didn’t wait long to respond, it launched missiles at Israel, officially escalating the fight. Trump had spent weeks saying he wanted a nuclear deal with Iran, even after Israel’s initial attack. He claimed Iran was open to it. But by Tuesday, his tone changed. First, he told reporters he didn’t want a ceasefire—he wanted “an end, a real end.” Hours later, on Truth Social, he posted “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in all caps. Two days later, he gave himself a two-week deadline to decide whether to launch a strike. He said there was still a “substantial chance” for diplomacy. By Saturday night, that chance was gone. US jets hit Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites, pulling American forces into another war in the Middle East. Crypto bounces after modest drop Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies dropped fast when the attack news hit. Within minutes, Bitcoin fell below $100,000, SOL hit $121, Ether dropped to $2,300, and XRP touched $2.09. But two hours later, prices had bounced back. Bitcoin was back above 102k, SOL rose over 130, and Ether and XRP held steady. The crypto market’s reaction was fast, chaotic, and short-lived. Investors didn’t wait to panic though at all. They bought the dip and moved on. Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry called Trump’s strikes a “dangerous war against Iran.” In a statement carried by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, the government said the US had “betrayed diplomacy” and described Israel as “genocidal and lawless.” It said Trump’s actions violated international law and the UN Charter and warned of “grave consequences and dire repercussions.” They also said it was Iran’s “legitimate right to fully and resolutely resist” and defend its national interests “by all necessary means.” Iran called on the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency to respond immediately. The government asked the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. The statement urged international bodies to condemn what it called “a flagrant and criminal act of illegality.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But that’s exactly what Jetking, a name once known for making radios and televisions in India, has done. The company, which later moved into IT education, faced tough times during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world shut down, Jetking’s 200 centers across India saw business dry up. Forced to rethink their future, the leadership explored around 15 different ideas to revive the company. In the end, they made a big move: to transform into a Bitcoin-centric company. In an interview with Coinpedia, CFO Siddarth Bharwani said, “Jetking’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset has had both symbolic and financial implications, The move sparked interest from a new class of investors, particularly younger or tech-savvy retail investors.” The company is aiming to hold 210 Bitcoins by the end of 2025. Navigating India’s 30% Crypto Tax India’s strict 30% tax on crypto profits hasn’t made things easy. But Jetking has taken a different route. “We follow a ‘Never Sell Bitcoin’ strategy,” Bharwani explained. This means the company doesn’t realize profits on its Bitcoin holdings, avoiding taxable events. Any changes in value are simply noted as revaluation reserves in the financial reports. Handling RBI’s Crypto Concerns The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has repeatedly raised concerns about crypto being used for illegal cross-border transfers, like hawala. Jetking says it takes these worries seriously and uses a compliance-first approach. All Bitcoin is bought via regulated, FIU-registered exchanges and stored with institutional-grade custodians that follow KYC and AML checks. Hopes for Better Crypto Laws in India As India works on a formal set of crypto rules, Jetking hopes for fairer regulations. The company supports government oversight but wants a shift from the flat 30% tax to a graded capital gains model based on how long crypto is held. “We expect shift from a flat 30% tax on gains to a graded capital gains tax model based on holding period. Enable carry-forward and offset of losses, as is the case with other financial assets and GST exemption or clarity when crypto is used purely as a treasury reserve, not as payment or service,” they said.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/exclusive-how-a-77-year-old-indian-brand-is-betting-big-on-bitcoin-despite-tough-taxes/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-22T07:04:34,"Crypto Analyst Sees Bitcoin (BTC) Mirroring Gold’s Parabolic Breakout of 2024 – Here’s His Outlook","A crypto strategist known for nailing the 2022 Bitcoin bottom says that BTC may be on the verge of igniting a parabolic surge. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 66,600 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be mirroring gold’s 2024 price action, when the precious metal struggled to clear resistance at $2,100 for multiple weeks before sparking a huge upside burst. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is likely consolidating below $110,000 to set the stage for a breakout and a parabolic rally to new all-time high prices. “Look at the $2,000-ish level [of gold]. This is the kind of asset we are now. If you expect anything else other than this, I think you’re just wrong… You see that breakout level that got tested four times, and you [had] false breakouts… I mean [gold] didn’t move for the longest time, and then it just went up only forever, which is kind of nuts to observe. But basically, I feel we’re that asset now, where you’re going to flirt with the same level like three or four times and people are going to lose all their money before it breaks out.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, gold is worth $3,368 while Bitcoin is trading for $102,114.
