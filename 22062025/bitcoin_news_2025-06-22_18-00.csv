This sharp decline came after shocking news from the global stage: fUS President Donald Trump announced a bombing operation on three nuclear sites in Iran, calling it a “successful” mission that left the facilities “obliterated.” Following this attack, Iran issued a fresh threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — a critical route for global oil shipments. This heightened geopolitical tension spooked global markets, including crypto, triggering a wave of panic selling and liquidations. In just one day, over $1.02 billion worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the slide. Popular altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also broke key support levels, signaling possible further drops ahead. What’s Next for Bitcoin? According to market analysts, Bitcoin is currently testing a support zone between $100,000 and $102,000. If it manages to hold above this, there could be a temporary bounce or sideways movement. However, if Bitcoin falls below this range, the next potential support lies around $96,000 to $97,000. At the time of writing, BTC has dropped below that support. There is also weakening momentum in the larger timeframes. Several technical indicators are hinting at a possible longer correction phase or extended sideways consolidation for Bitcoin in the coming weeks or months. While minor short-term recoveries could happen, analysts predict that strong bullish moves are unlikely in the immediate future due to both technical weakness and ongoing geopolitical risks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/1-billion-liquidated-bitcoin-price-crashes-below-100k-amid-us-iran-war-fears/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T15:33:07,"Max Keiser Predicts $800K BTC from ‘Bond Apocalypse,’ Markets Eye $93K","At the time of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) was a couple of hundred dollars under $103,000, after dipping 4% in 24 hours, but Max Keiser is suggesting this volatility is mere tremors before a seismic surge to $800,000. In a sit-down with Bitcoin Magazine’s Isabella Santos, the legendary BTC prophet claimed that the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield is the “lynchpin” threatening financial collapse and triggering Bitcoin’s epic moon mission. The Road to $800K In the interview , the Bitcoin bull laid out a doomsday scenario that could potentially lead to an astronomical spike in the king cryptocurrency’s price: “There is one piece of data that is the lynchpin of the entire global financial system… It’s the rate of interest on the 10-year Japanese bond,” Keiser declared. Currently, the yield is at about 3.5%, and any higher, the market watcher warned, could potentially lead to the collapse of the decades-long “yen carry trade,” where Wall Street borrowed near-zero-yen to fuel speculative investments. “The Japanese economy is going to have to start selling U.S. Treasury bonds to stay solid, which would create a cascading event, what I call the bond apocalypse, where the global bond market crashes.” He stated that if this were to happen, then trillions of dollars’ worth of capital would flee collapsing government debt and rush straight into BTC. “In that environment, Bitcoin spikes to $500,000, $600,000, $800,000.” Bearish Caution While Keiser’s prediction might have gotten the crypto community on X talking, the market remains rather tense and confused. Pseudonymous trader Mr Wall Street hinted at a potential short-term nosedive to the $93,000 to $95,000 range, warning that the charts were “screaming for lower.” Still, voices of resilience have been piping up, with analyst Axel Adler Jr. pointing to rising long liquidation dominance without a major price crash as a “good signal,” suggesting strong underlying buyer support. Additionally, on-chain sleuth DeFiTracer sees cooling Middle East tensions due to Iran’s apparent openness to talks as well as Fed member Christopher J. Waller’s signal for July rate cuts as bullish signals. He suggested these catalysts are quietly shifting markets from uncertainty “into the trust phase.” The post Max Keiser Predicts $800K BTC from ‘Bond Apocalypse,’ Markets Eye $93K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/max-keiser-predicts-800k-btc-from-bond-apocalypse-markets-eye-93k/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T15:00:40,"Bitcoin Closes Daily Price Below 50MA – Final Bearish Signal?","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to experience an extensive price correction losing over 7% of its market value in the last month. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain its bullish form after setting a new all-time high leading to speculations of a potential market top. Interestingly, popular market analyst and the host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Scott Melker has recently shared a market development that supports such bearish notions. Related Reading: Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500–$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone – Details Bitcoin Set For 26% Crash? In an X post on June 21, Scott Melker shares a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market hinting at a bearish long-term outlook. The season analyst reports that data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin’s has now closed below the 50-day moving average (50 MA) on the daily trading chart, a development that last occurred two months ago when Bitcoin traded around $84,000. The 50MA is a commonly used technical indicator that represents the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 days. As a lagging indicator, it helps traders identify the prevailing market trend. When the price remains above the 50 MA, it typically signals a bullish trend, while a move below the 50 MA may indicate bearish momentum or a potential trend reversal. Interestingly, Melker notes that Bitcoin last lost the 50 MA as a support zone in early February trading around $100,000. However, the loss of this price floor triggered an immense selling pressure forcing Bitcoin into prolonged market correction to reach market low of $74,000 in April. Amidst the current market uncertainty, the recent daily price close below 50 MA strengthens bearish sentiments suggesting Bitcoin is due for another potential 26% crash. In that case, investors could expect a downside target of around $76,200. To invalidate such bearish projections, Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $100,000 resistance level, fueling the chances to retest the current all-time high, and perhaps re-enter price discovery mode.

In tandem, the asset’s daily trading volume has crashed by 29.30% and is presently valued at $35.15 billion. With a market cap of $2.02 trillion, the “digital gold” continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world. However, according to prominent market analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin may actually be slipping into bearish territory as similarly predicted by Scott Melker. Based on insights from the MVRV pricing bands, if the market lose the current support at $102,000, it opens the door to a potential decline toward $82,000.

2025-06-22T14:59:31,"Texas Just Backed Bitcoin: Best Crypto to Buy as States Embrace $BTC Reserves","On Saturday, Texas became the first-ever US state to commit public funds towards the purchase of Bitcoin. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21) , officially authorizing the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Keep reading to learn more about this development, increasing investor and government confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, and what’s the best crypto to buy now in order to ride the upcoming crypto wave. Texas Passes Groundbreaking Bitcoin Reserve Bill ‘We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years.’ This is what the Texas Bitcoin bill’s author, State Senator Charles Schwertner, said in February . Four months later, Texas has put its faith in the ‘digital gold’ to strengthen its financials and act as an effective hedge against inflation. It’s worth noting that although Texas is the third US state to create a Bitcoin reserve (after Arizona and New Hampshire), it’s the first to create a publicly-funded reserve. Neither of the other two has allocated public funds for the purchase of Bitcoin. By putting actual taxpayer dollars into $BTC, Texas has not only officially recognized Bitcoin as a store of value but also signaled its unwavering trust and long-term commitment to the digital asset. A publicly-funded reserve is also likely to increase demand for Bitcoin. It’s also worth mentioning that large public companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have aggressively bought Bitcoin over the past few months. With here are some of the best new cryptos you can buy to benefit from Bitcoin’s growing acceptance among corporations and government agencies. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, Get Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to invest in if you want to eke out the maximum amount of returns possible from Bitcoin’s bull run. $BTCBULL’s biggest selling point is that it’s the ONLY crypto on the market right now, offering free (and completely legit) $BTC to its token holders. If you’re a $BTCBULL holder who has stored his tokens in Best Wallet , you’ll receive your share of free $BTC (depending on your $BTCBULL holdings) every time the king cryptocurrency reaches a landmark, such as $150K and $200K, for the first time. Thanks to its never-before-seen approach to rallying behind Bitcoin and community rewards, BTC Bull Token is predicted to explode 270% and reach $0.0096 by 2026 . A huge reason behind this is the project’s deflationary model, which will burn a part of the total $BTCBULL token supply at regular intervals, creating a supply shortage and hiking prices. The best part? $BTCBULL is currently in presale, where it has raised over $7.2M. Each token is priced at $0.002575, and here’s how to buy it . 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Building Layer 2 on Bitcoin for Scalability & Fast Transactions Despite being the OG blockchain, Bitcoin has been struggling with slow transaction speeds and high fees, as well as limited compatibility with decentralized applications and Web3. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . By building a Bitcoin Layer 2 and connecting it to the Layer 1 using a Canonical Bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring programmability and scalability to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Plus, it will do so without impacting the network’s security and decentralization benefits. Here’s how it works: You send $BTC through the Canonical Bridge, which converts it into wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can use wrapped $BTC to access high-speed DeFi apps, pay for transactions on the L2, etc. When you’re done, just raise a withdrawal request on the L2 network. It will again use a smart contract to verify the transaction and convert wrapped $BTC back to original $BTC. Luckily for you, one $HYPER is currently available for just $0.011975 (the token could soar 2,000% by 2030 ), and the project has in total raised over $1.5M. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – Educating Folks About Everything Crypto Tutorial ($TUT) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of crypto’s growth and increasing awareness among the masses. That’s because it’s an AI-powered tool that educates people about different crypto-related topics and tools, including setting up a crypto wallet . Other ‘tutorials’ in its repertoire include teaching people how to write smart contracts, trade on the best decentralized exchanges , and learn everything there is to know about the BNB chain ecosystem. $TUT has been on a sensational run of late, gaining more than 25% over just the past 7 days . It’s currently trading at $0.03583, offering a discounted entry point before it explodes to mimic crypto’s rise. As States Back $BTC, Altcoins Emerge as Attractive Investments With regulated, state-backed crypto holdings becoming increasingly mainstream, we’re clearly headed towards a world where diversified crypto assets (the best altcoins included) are looked at as both stores of value and investment opportunities. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing in crypto. The market is highly uncertain, and our article isn’t financial advice.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/texas-just-backed-bitcoin-best-crypto-to-buy-as-states-embrace-btc-reserves/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare

The cryptocurrency is down 5.5% throughout the last seven days.

In response, some media reports indicate that the Iranian Parliament has voted in support of closing the Strait of Hormuz – one of the world’s most criticial oil transit chokepoints.

The Strait, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, handling roughly 20% of the global oil trade. Reports of Iranian politicians mulling the closure of the Strait had observers worried about a significant spike in oil prices early Monday. ""After US strikes on Iran last night, 50+ large oil tankers were scrambling to leave the Strait of Hormuz. Markets have been closed, but an immediate drop in supply is expected to send prices higher. JP Morgan described this as their worst-case scenario in the Israel-Iran war,"" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. According to JPMorgan, oil could surge to $120-$130 per barrel in that scenario. That could potentially lift the U.S. inflation rate to 5%, the highest since March 2023. At the time, the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates. The losses in BTC weighed heavily over the broader crypto market, as usual, dragging major altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ETH lower.

ABC News reports that Veer Chetal, who is among the three men charged with siphoning 4,100 BTC worth $243 million in an elaborate scam last August, also agreed to testify against his co-defendants, Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano. Authorities say that the trio engaged in online social engineering attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send fake alerts to victims about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts. Chetal and Serrano would then call and pose as representatives from companies like Google and Yahoo in an effort to access victims’ accounts. Prosecutors say that Chetal, Lam and Serrano lived large after the heist , spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. But a week after the theft, Chetal’s parents were abducted in a botched ransom scheme. The suspects planned to demand payment from Chetal, believing he held large amounts of cryptocurrency. But the abductors were arrested quickly after the police responded to eyewitness calls. An off-duty FBI agent also happened to be passing by just as the kidnapping unfolded. Unsealed court documents also show that Chetal is being accused of playing a role in 50 similar heists that siphoned $3 million from victims between November 2023 and September 2024. Chetal now faces up to 24 years in prison, a fine ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 and restitution to the victim.

But is it time to give up or hang tight? Altcoins Down 80%: A Cycle Unlike Any Other The year started with big hopes, especially for altcoins. But instead of a rally, most altcoins dropped over 80% from their highs. According to analyst Michael Van de Poppe notes that this cycle is different from anything we’ve seen before, making it hard to compare to past market moves. This market cycle isn’t following the usual patterns. Is the #Altcoin market death? Well, that's a great question to ask yourself as you're seeing a constant bleed taking place on the markets with zero reversal. Especially when the expectations of this year were enormous, and, as a result, we've been getting an 80% decrease on… pic.twitter.com/iRcXra01cX — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 21, 2025 He believes we’re in a period similar to late 2019 or late 2020, times in crypto history that marked the bottom for altcoins before a new rally began. To support his view, van de Poppe draws comparisons with earlier cycles, like those in 2016 and 2019. In both cases, altcoins bottomed out during times of global uncertainty, while gold prices were climbing. Fast forward to today, and we see a similar picture: gold is strong, global markets are unstable, and investors are being cautious with risky assets. Why Altcoins Aren’t Moving Yet Despite a recent 40% surge from Ethereum against Bitcoin, most altcoins haven’t followed. Van de Poppe says this is because confidence and positive sentiment are missing from the altcoin space. Right now, it doesn’t take much selling to push prices lower, but there’s also quiet accumulation happening ; some investors are slowly buying up coins at these low levels. What Needs to Happen Next Poppe believes the next move depends on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin manages to bottom out and climbs toward $106,000, it could boost Ethereum again. That second push could trigger a strong rally across the altcoin market. And once that happens, short positions might get liquidated, leading to fast and sharp price moves up.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-the-altcoin-market-really-dead-or-just-waiting-for-its-moment/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Samson Mow is working with Sarah Knafo to promote a Bitcoin reserve strategy for France. France is ramping up both public and private Bitcoin activity. Despite progress, critics say Europe still lacks a clear position on Bitcoin as a state-held reserve asset. Mow met with Knafo at the BTC Prague conference this week, where the two discussed plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve for France and explore regulatory frameworks favorable to Bitcoin. After the meeting, Mow posted on X , saying he was “looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe.” Pro-Bitcoin EU Lawmaker Knafo Echoes Support for Nation-State Adoption Knafo, a member of the European Parliament with openly pro-Bitcoin views, echoed the enthusiasm. “France must take hold of these issues,” she wrote on X. She described Mow as “an expert on Bitcoin adoption by states, who has advised the President of El Salvador and many others.” Mow left Blockstream in 2022 to focus on helping governments integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies.

On June 3, Paris-based Blockchain Group announced the purchase of 624 BTC for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. In March, state-owned bank Bpifrance allocated €25 million to crypto-related investments. Still, Europe faces criticism for its slow pace. While the EU’s MiCA framework was fully enforced in December 2024, critics argue it lacks clarity on Bitcoin’s role in state treasuries. Coinbase and Gemini Push Deeper into EU Last week, it was reported that Coinbase and Gemini are expanding their European operations by securing regulatory licenses in Luxembourg and Malta, respectively. Gemini, led by the Winklevoss twins, is close to finalizing its license in Malta after receiving a MiFID II license from the country’s Financial Services Authority last month. Malta has already licensed exchanges like OKX and Crypto.com under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. However, some EU regulators are concerned about the speed of approvals in smaller nations with limited staff. Malta’s FSA defended its pace, citing years of experience and strong anti-money laundering standards. Meanwhile, Coinbase is set to receive a license from Luxembourg, where crypto firms have been labeled “high-risk” for money laundering . Coinbase has over 200 employees in Europe and plans to hire at least 20 more.

""The MPs have unanimously reached this conclusion merely in a consultation capacity. The decision lies with the Supreme National Security Council,"" Azimi said on X , responding to several media reports , including Al Arabia , that the Parliament has approved the closure. The Strait, a key global oil shipping route, accounts for one-fifth of the world's oil trade. Thus, the closure of the route is likely to send oil prices skyward, possibly into three figures, bolstering stagflation fears in oil-importing trade deficit nations like the U.S. Analysts expect Brent and WTI crude prices to open significantly higher on Monday, pricing a potential supply squeeze.

2025-06-22T13:49:11,"Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean? (CryptoQuant)","As bitcoin (BTC) attempts to recover from the effects of tensions in the Middle East, demand for the digital asset is drying up. Market experts from the on-chain intelligence company CryptoQuant have discovered that Bitcoin demand is entering a slowdown period. According to the latest CryptoQuant weekly report , the decline in Bitcoin demand comes after a period of acceleration that pushed the price of BTC towards $112,000. Demand-momentum metrics are currently showing their most negative readings on record — -2 million BTC. Bitcoin Demand is Weakening CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin spot demand has continued to grow but at a decelerated expansion rate. Apparent demand growth has fallen to 118,000 BTC over the last 30 days, compared to 228,000 BTC recorded on May 27. The metric is also below its 30-day moving average, indicating that the demand for BTC is weakening. Bitcoin whale and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have halved their purchases. The expansion of whale balances has fallen to 1.7% month-over-month (MoM) from 3.9% as of May 27. Daily BTC purchases from ETFs are also down from an April 23 local peak of 9,700 BTC to 3,300 BTC today. Additionally, demand from new participants entering the Bitcoin market is low, and overall demand momentum has turned negative. Short-term holders now account for 4.5 million BTC, a decline of 0.8 million BTC from the 5.3 million BTC they controlled as of May 27. Furthermore, investors in the futures market have sold their BTC to lock in profits and are currently opening new short positions. CryptoQuant said its Bitcoin Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric shows that participants offloaded their coins to take profits after BTC hit $110,000 last week. Afterward, they opened fresh short positions as BTC below $105,000 amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran. What to Expect For BTC to experience a sustained rally, whales and spot ETFs need to increase their demand for the cryptocurrency. New investors also need to buy BTC from the old ones, thereby expanding the balances of short-term holders. If demand continues to decline, BTC could plummet below $100,000 and fall to the support zone near $92,000. The crypto asset was hovering around $102,700 at the time of writing following the attacks from the US against Iran. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant has identified $92,000 as the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, which often acts as price support during bull markets. If BTC falls below this level, it could plunge to $81,000, which has been marked as the lower band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price. The post Bitcoin Demand is Drying Up, What Does This Mean?

The Iranian Parliament has approved a bill to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. The decision will need approval from Iran’s Supreme National Security Council to be fully implemented. A member of the National Security Committee of the Iranian Parliament said the Revolutionary Guards are ready to close the strait if necessary. On the other hand, there have been notable statements and moves from the US and Israel. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated on CNN's State of the Union program that Iran's nuclear program had not been completely eliminated, but had suffered serious damage. Herzog also stated that they did not want to draw the US into a war.

ETH, Pi Network, XRP Prices Down 9% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is reeling from a sharp sell-off over the past 24 hours, driven by a mix of geopolitical tensions, technical breakdowns, and mass liquidations. What Triggered the Crash? The immediate cause of the market crash was a major geopolitical event — U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 22. Ordered by President Donald Trump, the attack heightened fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. The move triggered a global “risk-off” sentiment, leading investors to dump riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in favor of safer options such as gold and the U.S. dollar. As a result, over $636 million in crypto leveraged positions were liquidated, sending shockwaves through the market. How Are Cryptos Reacting? Bitcoin (BTC) plunged sharply to $100,000 before managing a partial recovery. Despite the bounce, overall market sentiment remains in a tricky spot. Ethereum also faced heavy selling pressure, falling over 10% in a single day to around $2,196. XRP wasn’t spared either, dropping nearly 9% to trade at $1.97. Other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) also suffered losses ranging from 7% to 15%. What’s Next for the Market? Analysts warn that unless tensions between the U.S. and Iran ease, cryptocurrencies are likely to remain under pressure. Now all attention is on whether Bitcoin can hold above the $100,000 support level. If it fails, further losses could drag the market lower.

2025-06-22T13:40:49,"Texas Establishes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with Governor’s Approval","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), officially creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The new fund will hold Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset for the state, making Texas the first U.S. state to commit public funds to a dedicated Bitcoin treasury. The reserve will operate independently of the state’s general treasury system and is designed to bolster Texas’ financial resilience. According to the bill, it will also serve as a hedge against inflation. Only digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion are eligible for inclusion—an exclusive criterion that, for now, only Bitcoin satisfies. Administration of the fund will fall under the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, with guidance from a three-member advisory committee composed of crypto investment professionals. The fund may grow not only through direct Bitcoin purchases but also through forks, airdrops, investment returns, and public donations in cryptocurrency. A detailed performance report of the reserve will be published every two years. Texas Legislation Shields Reserve from Budget Pressures To protect the reserve from being redirected for other state expenses, Governor Abbott previously signed House Bill 4488. This bill ensures the Bitcoin reserve remains insulated from the general revenue fund, safeguarding it from shifting fiscal priorities and political changes. With this legislative framework in place, Texas joins Arizona and New Hampshire as one of only three U.S. states to establish a Bitcoin reserve law. However, Texas is the first to go a step further by allocating public funds and building a separate infrastructure for managing its Bitcoin holdings. This move signals a significant leap forward in Bitcoin’s mainstream financial adoption, particularly at the government level. Public Companies Continue Expanding Bitcoin Holdings The Texas initiative aligns with a broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption, especially among public companies. On Friday, David Bailey-founded Nakamoto Holdings secured $51.5 million in a private equity placement to increase its BTC holdings. In Europe, Paris-listed tech firm The Blockchain Group recently added 182 BTC, worth roughly $19.6 million, to its treasury, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC.

2025-06-22T13:35:55,"IREN: Improving Efficiency Position The Company For Growth","Summary I am bullish on IREN due to its industry-leading bitcoin mining efficiency and ability to maintain low production costs amid rising competition and energy prices. IREN’s strategic diversification into AI cloud services and HPC solutions positions it for resilient growth beyond bitcoin mining, capitalizing on higher CAGR opportunities in AI. Financially, IREN boasts strong revenue growth, robust liquidity, and a manageable debt profile, supporting continued expansion and operational flexibility. Given its undervaluation, superior revenue growth, and forward-thinking strategy, I reiterate a buy rating on IREN with significant upside potential despite sector risks. Thesis statement I am bullish on IREN Limited (NASDAQ: IREN ) driven by the improved efficiency of mining bitcoin from 16 J/TH in Q3’2024 to 15 J/TH in Q3’2025. The reason I think IREN’s mining efficiency is a major boost at the moment is because bitcoin mining is still profitable in 2025, but it’s becoming more competitive as more miners continue to join the blockchain market. For instance, Bitmain, Cannan, and MicroBT, which are the manufacturers of over 90% of global Bitcoin mining machines, are establishing a U.S base as a shield strategy against tariffs. This is one of the serious competitive aspects of the Bitcoin mining business. Given this competitiveness, in my opinion, the companies that have an efficient mining strategy are likely to maintain their profitability. It is from this angle I see IREN being a bullish stock. Now, let’s get to production efficiency. Bitcoin production cost in 2025 is up by 9% due to high energy prices and hashrate. Despite this increase, IREN has managed to maintain an efficient mining cost, which is a major driver of its profitability. MinerMag With the increase of hashrate from 5.6 EH/s in Q3’2024 to 29.4 EH/s in Q3’2025, an efficiency of 15 J/TH in the same quarter, the rise in bitcoin price contributed to its profitability from $8.6 million to $24.2 million. According to analysts’ prediction in 2025 that Bitcoin may hit $125,000 from its current ~$106,000 , this positions IREN in a better position to make profits from its efficient mining strategy, which is why I am bullish. I digress further in my explanations below why I believe IREN has a bullish potential. Company brief IREN Limited is a Bitcoin mining company that owns and operates its own data centers. The company also has alternative revenue generation from AI cloud services and high-performance computing (HPC) solutions. In November 2024, the company’s name was changed from Iris Energy Limited to IREN Limited, and it has maintained its headquarters in Sydney, Australia. Efficiency As A Significant Factor The median cost of mining a Bitcoin at the end of 2024 was $52,000 , and this cost has since risen to $64,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This cost is expected to increase by 9%, which is likely to hit an average of $70,000 by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Given this projected increase, IREN is installing over 50EH/s mining capacity by the end of June to compete favorably. Given that IREN is currently mining its Bitcoin at an efficient cost of $25,647 compared to its competitors, such as MARA at $51,877, CleanSpark, Inc. at $36, 139 and Cipher Mining at $44,385, it stands a chance for a bullish trend. MinerMag Now, here is the point. As the production cost increases, the production-efficient companies get some relief when cost-inefficient companies are strained by high production costs. As the production cost rises due to an increase in energy prices, IREN competitors face cost pressures . This highlights the importance of efficiency in the production of Bitcoins, which has driven companies such as Cipher Mining and IREN to post a double-digit score on stock gains between May and June of 2025, above Bitcoin’s modest price increase of 1.35% in the same period. Additionally, IREN is strategically positioning itself for revenue diversification as Bitcoin mining gets too competitive, with rising costs of Bitcoin mining and increasing network difficulty. IREN is diversifying in AI opportunities, such as pausing to expand mining at 50EH/s by the end of June 2025. IREN This broadening of revenue models positions IREN to a resilient business structure within its Bitcoin mining model to remain profitable. With approximately 2.1 million left to be minded, the mining business is getting too competitive and strenuous for a growth outlook. Adding competition and costs of fueling mining is driving a shift to AI opportunities. For example, when I look at IREN, despite ramping up its mining fleet, the pause at 50EH/s to focus on AI shows its preparation for other revenue generation activities. There are more AI opportunities compared to Bitcoin based on their CAGR. The mining market is estimated to have a CAGR of 10.57% between 2024 and 2035, which, compared to AI opportunity at a CAGR of 40% between 2023 and 2030, makes it reasonable for IREN to pause Bitcoin mining fleet enhancement. The demand for AI is ready for data centers, with an average of 70% demand for data center capacity. AI workloads are expected to advance by 2030, as seen with Gen AI, which is offering the fastest advanced AI use case. The demand for this advanced AI capacity is estimated to grow at a 33% CAGR between 2023 and 2030, which is why AI has more growth outlook compared to Bitcoin mining. The management of IREN and its ability to read the signs of time, like AI exodus from mining, shows its well-managed resilience, which is why I recommend a bullish position, McKinsey Financials; Q3’2025 highlight Due to the efficiency of production at 15 JT/H and 40EH/s, revenues in Q3’2025 increased by 164.8% YoY from $543 million in Q3’2024 to $148.2 million. The company’s diversification to AI opportunities saw AI cloud service generating a revenue increase of 500% from $0.6 million IN Q3’2024 to $3.6 million in Q3’2025. Adjusted EBITDA rose from $21.8 million in Q3’2024 to $83.3 million, reflecting an improvement in core business operations. For example, comparing Q3’2025 to Q3’2025, the average operating hashrate increased by 30% after Childress expansion from 22E.6 EH/s to 29EH/s. This increased Bitcoins mined in the third quarter by 12%, from 1,347 Bitcoin to 1,514 Bitcoin. On average, the price realized per Bitcoin increased by 11% from $84.3k to $93.3k. This was primarily driven by an increase in energy costs from $28.9 million to $36.5 million. This delivered a profit after tax of $24.2 million from $8.6 million in Q3’2024. The profits were also driven by an increase in Bitcoin in April and May of 2025, which rose from $76.0K to $111.0K. It indicates its resilience in efficiency and diversification, leading to profitability. Looking at the balance sheet, the company debt stands at $564.2 million due to a substantial convertible note of $322.5 million, which has a maturity period of 2029. Given that the company is pausing the extension of bitcoin mining enhancement at 50 EH/s by the end of June 2025. This me to a concern as to whether its debt-to-asset ratio is well managed. The total assets are $1,989.8 million, and its debt-to-asset is 0.28 or 28%, which is below the technology industry debt-to-asset ratio of 57.61% . This indicates that the current assets at IREN are capable of supporting its debt by a larger margin. Given the ample time the company has until its debt maturity in 2029, it indicates that it has a stable financial footing. Also, the company closed its Q3’2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $184.3 million and a total operating expense of $61,8 million. This shows that it has a liquidity coverage of 2.98, which is approximately 3x available cash reserves to operating expenses. The company is in a flexible position to finance its operations without strain. This can be seen in its ability to forecast expansion of 50 EH/s, which reduced capex by $43 million. Valuation I will value the company using Revenue YoY, and price-to-cash flows in relation to its competitors CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLSK ), MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ: CIFR ). Based on my bullish analysis that looks at IREN’s profitability and diversification into AI opportunities, I believe these metrics are the best valuation metrics at the moment. The revenue YoY shows that IREN has a high growth at 128.24% compared to its competitors, CLSK at 89.47%, MARA at 40.57%, and CIFR at -0.65%. Seeking Alpha The price-to-cash flow of all its competitors is negative. IREN P/CF is the second highest negative at -11.26, after CIFR at -13.06. Comparing IREN with CLSK at -6.92 and MARA at -6.34, they have a relatively higher P/CF ratio, which means their cash flows are higher and match the current price. However, in terms of P/CF, IREN is undervalued given that it has the strongest revenue YoY compared to its competitors, yet P/CF is valued to be low, which is why I believe the current price is not justified. Seeking Alpha These metrics confirm that IREN has a high bullish potential driven by its capacity to mine bitcoins at a minimum cost and its shift to AI opportunities, which present a bigger revenue generation. Given its EPS normalized estimate of $0.25 and its forward PE by the end of June 2025 of 82.58x, I approximate an upside of 98% from $10 to $20. This is within analysts’ estimates of between $20.30 to $33.00. Marketbeat Investment risks Bitcoin price volatility – Bitcoin is a volatile coin, and IREN faces a risk of market correction in case of a bearish move, which means a possible loss of revenues. Energy price fluctuations – Mining has become expensive due to rising energy costs. This is a risky situation for IREN if the prices keep increasing, which may reduce its profit margins further even at its existing efficiency. Technological obsolescence – By pausing the expansion of bitcoin mining machines at 50 EH/s, IREN faces a risk of revenue decline in case another company invests in an expansion that overtakes its efficiency. Conclusion The company is an ideal investment given its bitcoin mining efficiency and its preparation to mitigate mining competition by moving to AI opportunities. I am reiterating a buy entry on IREN at the current price.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796390-iren-improving-efficiency-position-the-company-for-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","IREN",cryptocompare

2025-06-22T13:30:16,"Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens","Bitcoin’s narrow price movement over the past week contradicts a much different development in the futures market. According to Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, a sharp rise in the long liquidation dominance metric could set the stage for a significant shift in sentiment that may completely wash out bears from the market. Adler shared the data in a recent post on X, accompanied by a chart showing previous points that resemble the current setup. Long Liquidation Spike Without Price Crash The dominance of long liquidations has jumped from 0% to +10% over the past seven days, a move that typically shows distress among bullish traders. However, what makes the current development especially noteworthy is the absence of a steep crash in Bitcoin’s price. Instead, in the just concluded week, Bitcoin held mostly within the $103,000 to $106,000 range until a recent drop, despite facing increasing pressure from long-side liquidations. Related Reading: XRP Daily RSI Trendline Breaks Down – What It Means For Price Axel Adler Jr. explained that this sustained liquidation of long positions without a full-blown price collapse indicates sustained buyer support. According to data from CryptoQuant, BTC’s long liquidations hit 2,200 BTC, the highest in the past week. Usually, a surge in long liquidations suggests that traders who were anticipating a price rally are being pushed out of their positions under pressure. The CryptoQuant chart below shows how spikes in long liquidation dominance, especially in the 15% to 20% range, have always preceded bullish reversals. According to the analyst, if this metric rises by another 5–7%, it could cause a high-probability scenario where bearish positions are washed out and flip Bitcoin’s price movements in favor of the bulls. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Large Wallets Accumulate As Retail Exits Data from Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, shows an interesting dynamic playing out among Bitcoin holders. Over the past ten days, wallets holding over 10 BTC have increased by 231 addresses, which is a 0.15% rise. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets containing between 0.001 and 10 BTC have dropped by 37,465 in the same timeframe. This trend highlights a divergence in sentiment between large and retail holders. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break? According to Santiment, the shift where whales and sharks accumulate while retail exits is a bullish combination for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market value is hovering just below $104,000 during this accumulation phase, and there could be an eventual upward breakout once retail holders begin to reenter. Image From X: Santiment Despite the underlying on-chain strength, Bitcoin’s spot price has taken a short-term hit in the past 48 hours. During this timeframe, Bitcoin’s price has slipped below support levels between $106,000 and $103,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,670, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The decline can be largely attributed to recent U.S. strikes on Iran. The U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 21-22) caused immediate risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin fell 3.2% after announcements of the strikes, much like its 6% drop during similar 2020 Iran tensions.

2025-06-22T13:21:30,"If Bitcoin Is Mirroring Gold, Bitcoin Hyper Could Be the 100x Amplifier","Gold finally broke free back in 2024, launching into a clean parabolic run after weeks of quiet buildup. According to well-known crypto trader DonAlt, Bitcoin is now doing something eerily similar. He describes $BTC’s current price action as a carbon copy of gold’s pre-breakout behavior. And if history is about to rhyme, then Bitcoin could be moments away from its own explosive move. That’s great for long-term holders. But what about the ones looking for more? The people who missed the early Bitcoin wave and are now scanning the horizon for something that can move faster and hit harder when BTC lights up again? That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. A new crypto project built specifically for this kind of moment. Bitcoin and the Gold Echo When gold finally cleared $2,1K in 2024 after weeks of grinding resistance, it triggered a vertical surge, climbing over 60% to its current price above $3,3K. Now, crypto analyst DonAlt believes Bitcoin is setting up for the same kind of breakout. With $BTC hovering around $102K, he says it’s consolidating just below $110K, retesting the same level multiple times – just like gold did before its parabolic move. DonAlt told his 66K YouTube followers that Bitcoin has become ‘that kind of asset,’ one that wears traders down with fakeouts before erupting upward. If the pattern holds, $BTC isn’t just heading for a new all-time high – it’s preparing to go ‘up only,’ just like gold did. What is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER)? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer 2 – not a sidechain, not a shortcut. It’s a full-speed, full-power execution layer that finally gives Bitcoin what it’s been missing for years: scalability. If Bitcoin is the slow, steady base layer of value, Bitcoin Hyper is where the action happens. Fast payments, meme coins , DeFi apps, and instant swaps – it all comes alive on Hyper. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper combines the speed and efficiency of Solana with the trust and weight of Bitcoin. That means sub-second transactions, near-zero fees, and cross-chain compatibility right out of the box. Hyper unlocks a whole new world where Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value – it’s fuel for culture, gaming, NFTs, and everything else the degens demand. It’s built for builders, traders, and dreamers. And everything on the network runs on one token: $HYPER. Whether you’re staking, paying for transactions, or launching a new meme coin, you’ll need $HYPER to do it. It’s more than a token, it’s your key to the ecosystem. With true interoperability across Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and beyond, this Layer 2 isn’t just about tech. It’s about unleashing Bitcoin’s full potential – with speed, utility, and meme power combined. And at just over one cent per token, that potential is still dirt cheap. Why You Should Buy $HYPER Now $HYPER has already raised over $1.5M in the presale. Right now, you can buy this token for just $0.011975. That’s not even two cents. And yet price forecasts suggest this coin could reach as high as $0.32 by the end of 2025. Let’s break that down. If you bought $1K worth of HYPER today at the presale price, you’d get around 83,5K tokens. If the price hits the 2025 high forecast of $0.32, your stack would be worth over $26,7K. That’s a 2570% gain – 26x from where we are now. But it gets better with staking. While Bitcoin Hyper offers a dynamic APY that can vary over time, let’s take a modest 20% as a baseline for this example. If you stake your 83,5K tokens for one year, you could earn around 16,7K extra tokens in rewards, bringing your total to just over 100K $HYPER. At today’s price, those extra tokens alone are worth around $200. But if the price hits that $0.32 forecast, your full stack would be worth over $32K. That’s the power of getting in early. Low entry, solid yield, and real potential for exponential upside. You don’t need a six-figure portfolio. You just need timing and conviction. Bitcoin Hyper is built for this exact kind of moment – when Bitcoin heats up, and everyone starts looking for the 100x shadow runner. The Amplifier Waiting to Ignite Bitcoin may be gearing up for its next big move, echoing gold’s explosive 2024 run. But history shows the real gains often come from the smaller, faster assets riding the wave. Bitcoin Hyper is built to be that amplifier – a high-speed Layer 2 positioned for the spotlight. And with the crypto presale still open, it’s one of the few rockets left on the launch pad. This article is for informational purposes only and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

Ether Slides After US Strikes Iran Nuclear Sites, Bitcoin Holds Ground Ether dropped sharply on Sunday after former President Donald Trump announced U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear sites. The token fell as much as 7.7% to $2,200, its lowest level in over a month, while Bitcoin briefly dipped below $101,000 before stabilizing. Donald Trump said American bombers targeted Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, citing concerns over Iran’s uranium enrichment. The market had already been jittery throughout the week amid speculation of a possible strike. Pantera Capital’s Cosmo Jiang noted that the confirmation of the attack likely marked a local bottom for crypto prices. “Bitcoin tends to lead the market out of a bounce during geopolitical uncertainty,” Jiang told Bloomberg .

Bitcoin faced a sharp rejection after attempting to break above an important resistance zone. After the failed breakout, the price dropped straight into a crucial buy zone, triggering liquidations across the market. In total, over $400 million worth of long positions were wiped out in just a day. A major factor behind this recent market nervousness is the United States entering the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Analysts believe that if the situation worsens further, it could negatively impact global financial markets — whether stocks or crypto — causing a sharper decline. With fears of a potential World War III rising, investors rushed to the safety of gold and the US dollar, while riskier assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies saw heavy selloffs. Additionally, in the recent FOMC meeting, interest rates were not cut as expected. This paused the market’s momentum and dampened the optimism for a quick recovery. A bull market might take a little longer to arrive. Amid the current market uncertainty, investors are searching for a bullish spark to lift sentiment. Speculation is swirling about Bitcoin potentially surging to $200,000 or even $250,000 by the end of the year. In an interview with Coinpedia, Jetking, an Indian company accumulating Bitcoin from 2022 said, “We predict Bitcoin prices to be in the range of $ 140000-150000 by year end.” Bitcoin Short-Term Price Action: Bitcoin price briefly touched ₹101,000, then attempted a small recovery. However, overall market sentiment remains weak, with lower volumes compared to Friday. Experts are now closely watching the ₹100,000 support level — a crucial point that needs to hold to avoid a deeper correction. It is struggling to break past the ₹102,600 resistance zone. A recovery is possible if Bitcoin manages to reclaim this level, but so far, that hasn’t happened. If the price fails to hold ₹100,000, another drop could follow, possibly with reduced trading volumes.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/exclusive-bitcoin-price-prediction-150k-bitcoin-dream-isnt-dead-yet-despite-market-crash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps As US Strikes Key Sites In Iran US President Donald Trump announced that the United States had conducted successful airstrikes targeting key nuclear installations in Iran. Markets plunged after the announcement, with BTC dropping to a low of $100,979 as traders panicked. Trump took to Truth Social to state, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561.

Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Despite facing volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday, BTC registered an increase of 0.35% but fell 0.24% on Thursday to settle at $104,631.
