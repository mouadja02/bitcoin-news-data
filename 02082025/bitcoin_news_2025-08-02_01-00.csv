2025-08-01T22:37:08,"Michael Saylor says Strategy doesn't want to control Bitcoin supply - ""Everyone should own it""","Michael Saylor says he doesn’t want all the Bitcoin. “We want everybody else to have their piece,” he told CNBC, during an interview following Strategy’s earnings report yesterday. The company now holds 628,791 Bitcoin, about 3% of the total supply that will ever exist. But Saylor, who serves as executive chairman, said that’s not the endgame. He said: “We wouldn’t want to own all of it. I wouldn’t want to. We see Bitcoin as a digital capital. The business model is to accumulate the digital capital and issue digital credit like preferred stocks against that capital.” Strategy expands its Bitcoin holdings through structured offerings Saylor said the company initially aimed to raise $500 million in its latest preferred stock offering, but bumped that to $2.5 billion due to investor demand. “This is the largest IPO of the year,” he added. The company has now done four IPOs this year, two at $500 million, one at $1 billion, and this latest at $2.5 billion. Strategy is taking that money and using it to buy more Bitcoin. “We’ll sell a credit instrument like Strike and we’ll buy Bitcoin,” Saylor said. He explained how the company uses a multi-tiered structure to attract different investor types. The equity side, he said, functions like 2x Bitcoin, aimed at investors looking for amplified returns. Then there’s Strike, which gives 80% of the upside, a 20% structured dividend, and principal protection for those who prefer hedge funds or S&P-style products. And now there’s Stretch, which he described as a type of “Treasury Bitcoin.” It’s designed for people who want low volatility, monthly yield, and principal protection — “like a high-yield savings account,” Saylor said. “It kind of competes with money markets or treasuries.” He said the average price of the company’s Bitcoin holdings sits around $73,000. The idea is to take the volatility, strip it out, and sell back structured versions that traditional investors can digest. “We’re refining it into securities that conventional investors can buy depending on their risk tolerance and their duration interest,” he said. Saylor says Bitcoin is replacing cash for corporate treasuries When asked about whether companies like Apple or Microsoft should hold Bitcoin instead of treasuries, Saylor pointed to SEC rules that stop companies from buying each other’s stock. “The only security Apple can buy is Apple stock,” he said. “So in general, if you’re trying to create shareholder value, you don’t want to park it in a fiat currency. You want to park it in a…” and then he paused. “You want to park it in Bitcoin.” He said Bitcoin is eating into foreign real estate, private equity, public equity, and other traditional stores of value, calling it a shift from 20th century physical assets to 21st century crypto. “If the Mag-7 could buy each other’s securities, they would be better off,” he said. “But they can’t.” Saylor made it clear that even with nearly 630,000 Bitcoin, Strategy isn’t trying to corner the market. “I don’t think we’ll get all of it. I don’t think 3 to 7% is too much,” he said, adding that BlackRock owns similar stakes in multiple sectors. He also noted that Strategy started its Bitcoin journey when the price was $10,000, and now that Bitcoin is above $100,000, 97% of the supply is owned by others. “Somebody else, not us, has it,” he said. The interview ended with a question about Wall Street legend Warren Buffett, who once called Bitcoin “rat poison.” Saylor was asked what would happen if Buffett and others dumped their treasury holdings and bought Bitcoin instead. While Saylor didn’t answer directly, he stayed on message, which is that fiat is no longer where smart money goes. “You don’t want to park your entire financial future in fiat currency,” he said. “Or US Treasuries.” Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-01T22:00:08,"Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking?","Ethereum has faced an 8% correction since Monday, cooling off from its recent rally and slipping below the key $3,850 level. This move suggests that the bullish momentum that carried ETH higher in July is beginning to fade, with price now entering a critical consolidation phase. Bulls are still holding key support levels, but the threat of a deeper correction is growing as selling pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet On-chain data shows signs of profit-taking from large investors, adding to short-term volatility and uncertainty. Heavy selling volume over the past two days has sparked speculation across the market, especially as Ethereum remains below recent local highs. Analysts are split in their outlook—some argue that this is a healthy pullback within a broader uptrend, while others warn of a potential slide toward the $3,400–$3,500 range if sentiment worsens. Despite the recent drop, Ethereum’s long-term structure remains intact, with fundamentals like growing DeFi usage and Layer 2 adoption continuing to support the narrative. However, the next few days will be critical. If bulls can defend current levels and regain momentum, ETH could attempt another move toward $4,000. If not, the market may see extended downside pressure before a clearer recovery emerges. Ethereum Sees Massive Sell-Off In Two Minutes According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum experienced a dramatic spike in taker sell volume, reaching $335 million in just two minutes. This massive wave of sell orders signals a key moment in the market, one that could mark either the peak of profit-taking or the end of panic-driven capitulation. While some interpret the event as large investors securing gains after the recent rally, others believe this could reflect emotional selling from retail traders spooked by short-term volatility. Despite the heavy selling pressure, Ethereum’s long-term bullish narrative remains intact. Large players continue to accumulate, taking advantage of dips and buying from weaker hands. This activity suggests strategic positioning ahead of expected growth in adoption, especially as Ethereum cements its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. ETH spent months in a downtrend earlier this year, weighed down by macro uncertainty and regulatory fears. Yet, while the broader market showed weakness, sophisticated investors appeared to accumulate. Now, with sentiment shifting and the price structure strengthening, Ethereum seems well-positioned for the months ahead. The $335 million sell-off highlights market vulnerability—but also shows that whales are stepping in. If price holds current levels and sentiment stabilizes, Ethereum could see a renewed push toward the $4,000 mark as confidence returns. Related Reading: Whale Buys $153M In Ethereum From Galaxy Digital OTC: Institutions Are Betting Big ETH Tests Support After Breakdown Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken below its critical resistance zone near $3,860, signaling increased selling pressure and short-term weakness. After maintaining a steady range for nearly two weeks, the price has dropped to $3,619 on the 4-hour chart, finding temporary support just above the 100-period SMA (green line), currently near $3,670. This breakdown comes amid an uptick in bearish volume, suggesting momentum may favor sellers in the short term. The 50-period SMA (blue line), located around $3,762, has now turned into near-term resistance, capping any immediate recovery attempts. If bulls fail to reclaim the $3,760–$3,800 zone, Ethereum could risk deeper downside toward the next key support around $3,175 (200 SMA, red line) or even $2,852, which served as a base in early July. Related Reading: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC Despite this weakness, the broader trend remains structurally bullish as long as price stays above the 200 SMA. However, bulls must reclaim the $3,860 level and build momentum above it to regain strength. Until then, volatility is expected, especially as profit-taking and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment.
