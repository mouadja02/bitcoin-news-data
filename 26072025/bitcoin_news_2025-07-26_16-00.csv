2025-07-26T13:43:00,"Russian crypto traders under pressure from new laws","Russia has been adopting and updating laws allowing it to target cryptocurrency transactions ahead of next year‚Äôs launch of its own coin, the digital ruble. The legislative changes make it harder for ordinary Russians to pay with or trade crypto, as operations like these can lead to account freezing, asset seizure and even criminal prosecution. Payment system law to hit peer-to-peer crypto trades in Russia The federal law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù now empowers banks to restrict access to a client‚Äôs bank account if it‚Äôs involved in any kind of suspicious transactions, leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media raised the alarm this week. Accounts can be blocked if money linked to illegal activities has been credited to them, the portal pointed out, warning that users of crypto exchange services and participants in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions can easily find themselves in a situation like this. The legislation allows financial institutions to take action in a number of scenarios. These include receiving complaints from third parties, signals alleging illegal actions, including fraud-related flows, and any transfers triggering risk detection systems. Restrictions can be partial or full. In the first case, an affected person is unable to use the payment cards and banking app of a particular institution, and in the latter, the individual loses access to cards issued by all banks and to their platforms. The law‚Äôs provisions can be used to target cryptocurrency traders whose bank accounts can be blacklisted by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). The most common instances involve the exchange of digital coins for rubles or P2P swaps. No one is safe from receiving ‚Äúdirty‚Äù cash from fraud and money laundering schemes, online gambling, or other illegal activities, when selling their cryptos for fiat through an online exchanger or a P2P platform, the report noted. Moscow can use money laundering legislation to curb crypto usage Russian banks can also freeze accounts under the law ‚ÄúOn combating the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism,‚Äù also known as the ‚Äúmoney laundering law.‚Äù It allows banks to flag as ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù and block any sale of cryptocurrency through P2P platforms and digital asset exchanges. Some of its texts were originally intended to deal with a phenomenon known as ‚Äúdropping.‚Äù In Russian slang, a ‚Äúdropper‚Äù is someone who lends their bank account, wallet or card to fraudsters who use them to launder their criminal proceeds. However, critics say the same provisions can be employed against ordinary users of crypto exchanges and P2P trading platforms who could end up with their bank accounts blocked by financial authorities and institutions as well. In May, legal commentators involved in the crypto space warned that recent amendments to the Criminal Code, again aimed at ‚Äúdroppers,‚Äù or ‚Äúmoney mules,‚Äù as they are called in the West, can also be used to threaten crypto traders with account blocking and even prison time. In June, the Bank of Russia urged commercial banks to exert tighter control on crypto-related transfers. The regulator insisted on the swift identification of such transactions. The updated code authorizes banks to impose monthly limits on wires and prevent cash deposits. Russia clears ground for upcoming digital ruble launch The latest Russian offensive against decentralized digital money comes as Moscow prepares for the full implementation of its digital ruble. The CBR recently set the dates for the gradual launch of the central bank digital currency, which should start on September 1, 2026, after Putin‚Äôs recent call for ‚Äúwide adoption.‚Äù Along with the state-issued coin, Russia plans to introduce a universal QR code for payments. Its monetary authority has been vehemently opposed to allowing the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for goods and services in the country. Crypto payments are only possible within a special ‚Äúexperimental legal regime‚Äù designed to help Russian companies circumvent financial restrictions in foreign trade. Using cryptocurrency as a means of payment was banned with the law ‚ÄúOn Digital Financial Assets‚Äù which went into force in 2021.

While it is thought that this fund may have been newly minted, it is estimated that the company raised funds through share sales in order to increase its Ethereum (ETH) accumulation. SharpLink, which hasn't purchased any ETH all week, currently holds approximately 360,900 ETH in its wallet, with a total value of approximately $1.34 billion. Related News: Everyone Thinks Bitcoin Will Peak Soon, But This Analyst Says ‚ÄòEveryone Is Wrong‚Äô ""The Real Peak Date and Price..."" SharpLink transferred the USDC it received to its Galaxy Digital wallet. Given that the company has previously made large ETH purchases through Galaxy Digital, this transfer is believed to be for a new ETH investment. SharpLink Gaming purchased 74,656 Ethereum between July 7th and 13th, bringing its total holdings to 280,706 ETH. This figure was worth over $1 billion as of July 21st. This puts SharpLink at more Ethereum than any other institution in the world, including the Ethereum Foundation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-26T13:00:38,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.44 Price Change 24h -0.23% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.44 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA ‚Äì 200-Day SMA ‚Äì 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi Price Analysis Pi/USDT is consolidating near $0.4418, showing low volatility and trader indecision. Support level is strong around $0.4400, preventing further downside movement in the current session. Resistance is at $0.4453, restricting upward momentum on price movement. On July 26 2025 the Pi Network‚Äôs daily chart shows a slow dropping pattern with narrow-bodied candles gathering around $0.4418. The price action saw a minimal drop of 0.23%, closing at $0.4418 after reaching a high of $0.4453 and a low of $0.4400. The chart shows a persistent downtrend from July 21‚Äôs failed breakout, with follow-through selling pressure dragging price lower into tight consolidation. Pi 1-day price chart shows a bearish trend with RSI at 40 On the 24-hour chart, Pi is trading at $0.4413, reflecting a period of consolidation with minimal volatility. MACD line at -0.0201 sits below the signal line at -0.0239. This setup highlights ongoing negative momentum, although the histogram is flattening. RSI reading stands at 40.19, Pi/USDT is in a neutral-to-weak zone. Despite ecosystem activity and past price fluctuations, the market is offering little volatility in the current phase. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network (Pi/USDT) is trading at $0.4414 on the 4-hour chart, showing signs of consolidation after recent downward movement. The MACD line is at 0.0044, below the signal line at 0.0046, indicating slight bearish momentum. This suggests weak buying pressure as sellers continue to dominate in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 42.68. These values place Pi in a neutral-to-bearish territory, hinting at fading bullish momentum. If RSI dips below 40, it may suggest further downside pressure unless buying activity increases near support. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Looking ahead, support holds around $0.4400, with a possible drop toward $0.42 if selling pressure increases. On the upside, resistance near $0.450 must be cleared to trigger any short-term bullish momentum Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly‚Äîneither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi‚Äôs real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 PI has recently announced that over 2.6 million users joined Pi Network‚Äôs Pi2Day 2025 Ecosystem Challenge, with more than 761,000 completing all steps to unlock exclusive rewards and test new tools. The highlight was the launch of Pi App Studio, a no-code AI platform where over 34,800 Pioneers created 21,700+ chatbots and custom apps. Additionally, more than 37.7 million Pi tokens were staked through the Ecosystem Directory Staking program, underscoring rising community support for Pi utilities and decentralized app development.

He notes that this is a serious issue and the Pi Core Team needs to address it.¬†According to him,¬†relying solely on a passphrase to access a Pi wallet is a major security risk. If that passphrase is stolen or leaked, anyone can access the wallet and drain the funds Some pioneers are raising concerns about compromised wallets and stolen passphrases. These concerns are valid, and the Pi Core Team should take them seriously by working toward a robust solution.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network‚Äôs price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn‚Äôt be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458‚Äì$0.50 range. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48‚Äì$0.52, range.
