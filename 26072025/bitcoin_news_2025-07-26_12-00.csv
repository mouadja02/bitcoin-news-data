2025-07-26T09:45:44,"Wall Street banking giant sets Bitcoin’s price for end of 2025","Wall Street banking giant Citi (NYSE: C ) is projecting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin ( BTC ) by the end of 2025, with its base-case target set at $135,000. According to the bank’s valuation framework, the flagship digital currency could reach $135,000 while a more optimistic outlook sees Bitcoin surging to $199,000. The updated forecast is guided by Citi’s refined model, which emphasizes three main price drivers, including user adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs . To this end, Citi analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert noted that the core valuation begins with a 20% increase in user growth under a linear network model, supporting a price near $75,000. Macroeconomic headwinds, such as weak equity markets and underperforming gold , are expected to shave off about $3,200. Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin’s price However, Citi anticipates around $15 billion in net ETF inflows, which could add approximately $63,000 to the model, bringing the base-case forecast to $135,000. In its most conservative scenario, Citi expects Bitcoin to drop to $64,000 by year-end if equity markets remain under pressure and ETF inflows fall short. Citi’s analysis also indicated that ETF flows now account for over 40% of BTC’s price movements, making them a central component of the bank’s valuation model. Weekly Bitcoin returns and ETF flows. Source: Citi The analysts highlighted a strong correlation between ETF net flows and BTC returns, estimating that every $1 billion in weekly inflows adds about 3.6% to Bitcoin’s price. “Since launch, 41% of Bitcoin return variation can be explained by flows alone (the relationship is just as strong even accounting for equity returns). So far this year, we have seen just over $19 billion of flows, including $5.5 billion month-to-date. We expect flows to continue for the rest of the year,” Citi noted. The outlook also emphasized crypto’s growing role in traditional finance. In this case, Bitcoin is now included in major indices, such as the S&P 500 and Russell, with rising institutional exposure bolstering its influence across broader markets. Bitcoin price analysis Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to hold above the $115,000 support zone after a retracement from its record high of $123,000. At press time, BTC was trading at $117,594, up over 2% in the past 24 hours, though down 0.6% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

2025-07-26T09:30:46,"XRP and Solana Pull Back as WeWake Shows Strong Potential to Become a Top Crypto Presale","XRP and Solana face short-term corrections as Bitcoin consolidates, prompting traders to seek new crypto opportunities. WeWake rises as a top presale crypto, offering walletless, gasless Web3 access through smart wallets and social logins. With a clear roadmap and utility-driven tokenomics, WeWake is drawing attention from developers and early-stage crypto investors. XRP and Solana are experiencing pullbacks as the crypto market cools and Bitcoin remains flat near $120,000. Investors are now focusing on WeWake, a top presale crypto offering walletless and gasless access to Web3. With simple social logins and developer-friendly tools, WeWake is positioned to simplify crypto adoption and attract mainstream users. Altcoin Momentum Slows as XRP and Solana Retreat After a strong rally across major altcoins in July, XRP and Solana are now facing signs of short-term fatigue. While Bitcoin remains in a tight range near $120,000, traders are rotating capital away from top altcoins. XRP is down 6% from its recent local high, and Solana has retraced nearly 7%, according to CoinGecko. Analysts believe this correction is driven by over-leveraged long positions and the buildup of sell orders. “We are seeing heavy liquidation potential in Solana due to record-high open interest,” said Ryan McMillin, CIO at Merkle Tree Capital. This behavior has historically triggered fast but temporary declines across altcoin markets. Ethereum, which led the altcoin rally, is also pausing. Sell pressure on ETH has increased, with 500,000 ETH queued to unstake. Analysts expect this to affect Ethereum ETF inflows and short-term price movement. The weakening momentum in Ethereum has contributed to XRP and Solana’s recent price cooling. Bitcoin Holds Steady While Short-Term Pressure Builds Bitcoin has stayed between $117,000 and $120,000 since mid-July. This consolidation period has offered a temporary boost to altcoins, but analysts now warn of a correction. According to CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, Ethereum’s recent strength might reverse, and that could put added pressure on Solana and XRP. CoinGlass reports a rise in ETH sell orders within 10% of its current price, showing short-term caution. Meanwhile, Solana’s open interest suggests increased leverage, which may lead to liquidations if prices drop further. These signs point to a market that is pausing rather than reversing direction. Despite short-term weakness, some analysts are still focused on the broader outlook. McMillin added, “Rate cut expectations and global liquidity trends remain supportive, and we expect continued institutional demand for digital assets.” WeWake Gains Momentum as a Top Presale Crypto While altcoins are pulling back, WeWake is drawing interest as a top presale crypto. The project introduces a walletless and gasless Layer 2 blockchain built for simple Web3 access. WeWake removes the need for traditional wallets, seed phrases, or gas fees, allowing users to sign in with Google or Telegram. This simplified onboarding process is powered by ERC-4337 smart wallets and a zk-rollup Layer 2 framework. “Onboarding into crypto should be as easy as logging into an app,” reads a statement on the WeWake site. The platform’s infrastructure enables this by using built-in Paymaster APIs to sponsor gas for all transactions. Developers can also integrate WeWake’s SDK to onboard users in seconds without downloads or wallet installations. These features make WeWake a top presale crypto as the ecosystem prepares to scale toward mainstream adoption. WeWake Roadmap and Tokenomics Draw Developer Attention The WeWake roadmap outlines four major development phases. In Q4 2025, the platform will focus on core development and integrations. These include its smart wallet architecture, Paymaster logic, and SDK release. A public testnet is scheduled for Q1 2026, followed by a mainnet launch in Q2 2026. During Mainnet, WeWake plans to activate its Paymaster API and launch on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform also aims to roll out Telegram-based wallet tools and open ecosystem grants for GameFi and DeFi dApps. WeWake’s WAKE token has a total supply of 308,726,951. Of this, 32% is allocated to the presale, 14% for ecosystem incentives, and 12% for governance and treasury. The rest is distributed among liquidity, staking rewards, marketing, and reserves. This structured allocation supports sustainable growth and early adoption, making WeWake a top presale crypto of interest to retail users and developers.

In a new announcement, the largest bank stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio says its board of directors has approved a $40 billion common stock repurchase program that goes into effect on August 1st. A stock buyback is when a company buys shares of its own stock, reducing the total number of outstanding shares, according to Bankrate. Buybacks are seen as a way to increase value for investors. Says Bank of America, “[Wednesday’s] authorization will continue providing additional capital return flexibility, reflecting the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the economic cycle.” The new program replaces the existing program, which had $9.1 billion in common stock repurchases remaining. Bank of America also announced a dividend increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter, for a total of $0.28 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26th to shareholders of record as of September 5th. Bank of America has a market cap of $360.3 billion and is trading for $48.45 per share at time of writing. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 631.57 million shares of Bank of America, its fourth most valuable holding, behind Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.

2025-07-26T09:12:41,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy Faces IMF Hurdles and Limited Public Reach, Says NGO","El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment appears to be faltering under the weight of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan agreement and declining public engagement, according to the non-profit group My First Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption has slowed due to IMF loan restrictions and lack of public education. The government agreed to halt new Bitcoin purchases despite publicly showcasing its holdings. The Chivo wallet will be privatized, raising doubts about the long-term role of Bitcoin in public services. Quentin Ehrenmann, the organization’s general manager, said government-backed education and adoption efforts have stalled since the IMF deal, leaving ordinary citizens behind. “Since the government entered into this contract with the IMF, Bitcoin is no longer legal tender, and we haven’t seen any other effort to educate people,” Ehrenmann told Reuters . Bukele Talks Bitcoin, But IMF Deal Blocks New Purchases While President Nayib Bukele’s administration has continued to showcase its BTC holdings, the IMF revealed that El Salvador agreed not to purchase additional Bitcoin as part of the deal. This is a direct contradiction to claims by the country’s Bitcoin Office, which stated that daily purchases were ongoing. “The government, apparently, continues to accumulate Bitcoin, which is beneficial for the government — it’s not directly good for the people,” Ehrenmann said. For more than two years in a small district in the eastern part of El Salvador, Bitcoin enthusiasts have created a learning center and provided technical support to owners of about 200 businesses and entrepreneurs on using the cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/S2bJ4YOYCf — Reuters (@Reuters) July 25, 2025 In January, the country’s legislature moved to roll back public sector involvement in Bitcoin to stay within IMF loan requirements. The shift has raised questions about the long-term viability of El Salvador’s crypto policy and whether the original vision has quietly been shelved. The Chivo wallet, once promoted as a centerpiece of the country’s Bitcoin adoption, will be shut down from public control, and the IMF clarified that while the wallet will remain operational, it must be fully privatized and no longer run on government funds. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office , El Salvador currently holds about 6,244 BTC, worth roughly $742 million. Some blockchain analysts, including firms like Arkham, have observed steady 1 BTC per day transfers from exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex to addresses reportedly linked to the Salvadoran government. However, whether these are official purchases or private transactions remains unclear. Governments and Institutions Continue Bitcoin Buys Other governments and companies continue to expand their Bitcoin treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently acquired 797 Bitcoin for $93.6 million . Meanwhile, The Blockchain Group in France and the UK’s Smarter Web Company added over 340 BTC combined . Strategy, the first Bitcoin treasury company, posted $14 billion in unrealized gains in Q2 2025 . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders . Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures.

2025-07-26T09:06:50,"Best Crypto Presales to Ride the Dip as XRP and Dogecoin Prices Fall","The post Best Crypto Presales to Ride the Dip as XRP and Dogecoin Prices Fall appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After this month’s disorienting mix of bullish momentum and widespread profit-taking, the crypto market has taken a sharp turn. Earlier this week, more than $1.29 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated, closing over 277,000 traders’ positions – and the price of Bitcoin briefly dipped by almost 5% to lows around $115,000. Two of the most heavily impacted crypto assets are XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), which both saw their valuations drop by billions of dollars. While this volatility may shake short-term holders, the shrewdest investors are turning to early-stage crypto presales as a way to manage risk and diversify their holdings. To help investors navigate the current wave of volatility, we’ll highlight three emerging altcoins that are currently in presale. Available at discount prices that will quickly increase as the sales continue, these tokens offer a way to diversify into high-upside opportunities with low entry points. XRP and Dogecoin Tank, Crypto Market Falls 5% in 24 Hours While the crypto markets have been on a record growth spree since early July, jumping from a total valuation of $3.3 trillion to more than $4 trillion, the last few days have come with a lot of volatility. The global crypto market cap now stands at $3.93 trillion, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The meme coin sector has also been hit, dropping by 4% over the last day. Leading altcoins such as XRP (XRP), and blue-chip meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), have been severely affected by the market’s latest dip. XRP, the third-largest crypto token in the world, is down by almost 10% in the past week. This decline could be tied to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly Donald Trump’s latest proposed tariff hikes , which have unsettled global markets. According to TradingView’s automated technical analysis , XRP currently sits in a mix of neutral and “Buy” zones for the 1-day timeframe, suggesting that traders approach this coin with caution when attempting to buy the dip. DOGE, which saw a massive rally of up to 100% between June 22 and July 21, has now pulled back to a key support level around $0.22, marking a 22% drop in five days. Although DOGE is still up 85% over the last 12 months, its recent fall underscores the volatility that often follows rapid gains. With large-cap assets under pressure, investors are increasingly seeking presale-stage tokens that may offer more upside with reduced short-term risk. Here are three of the best crypto presales that could help investors ride out the recent market dip. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) One of the standout crypto presales this year has been Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), which has already raised over $4.8 million. The token is part of a larger mission to create the first-ever Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built specifically for the Bitcoin network. By introducing faster speeds, lower fees, and DeFi functionality to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper aims to significantly enhance the network’s utility. At the core of this innovation is the high-throughput Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which powers Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 environment. NEW Crypto – First Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain! The system bridges native BTC from the Bitcoin Layer 1 onto Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 network, using zero-knowledge proofs and a secure bridge. Once on the L2, users can enjoy near-instant wrapped BTC transfers, staking rewards, and access to decentralized apps – using the HYPER token to pay for L2 transactions. For added incentives, token holders can stake HYPER (priced at $0.0124 per token) to generate an APY (annual percentage yield) of up to 204%, with over 257 million tokens already staked. This combination of clear utility and staking appeal is a major reason why analysts like Austin Hilton see huge growth potential in Bitcoin Hyper. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Bitcoin Hyper is clearly planning to become a long-term player in the crypto space. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Presale TOKEN6900 (T6900) TOKEN6900 (T6900) has burst onto the scene with bold branding and an unapologetically absurd concept. Marketed as “the new global benchmark for brain rot finance,” the token has raised over $1.1 million in its presale by embracing humor, chaos, and community culture over traditional fundamentals. Inspired by the success of SPX6900 (SPX), which soared over 6,900% in the last year, TOKEN6900 hopes to replicate the same viral trajectory. Along with a similarly chaotic energy, the project has even minted exactly one token more than SPX’s total supply as a tongue-in-cheek nod to its roots. NEW PROFITABLE PRESALE? (TOKEN6900 Presale Review) T6900 may have no roadmap in the traditional sense, but it does have a clear mission to build a large community of loyal followers. To achieve this target, TOKEN6900 is set to allocate 40% of the total T6900 supply for marketing purposes. Notably, while the project does not promise fundamentals, it still offers a staking mechanism, with a live APY of up to 55%. Apart from retail investors, who will find T6900’s presale price of $0.0067 appealing, TOKEN6900 has also become popular among analysts such as Cilinix Crypto – who claims this could be a high-risk but potentially rewarding investment. For those bullish on the meme coin space, T6900 could be one of the year’s biggest underdog contenders. Visit TOKEN6900 Presale Snorter (SNORT) The recent market dip has affected the Solana meme coin space as well, with this sector dropping by 5% in a single day. Despite this challenge, Snorter Token (SNORT) – a new Solana-based presale – is continuing to raise between $50,000 and $100,000 daily. Combining meme coin culture with real utility, The Snorter project is preparing to launch a Telegram bot that helps users optimize their Solana meme coin trades. One of Snorter Bot’s most attractive features is its low transaction fee range. Most trading bots on Solana, such as Bonk Bot and Trojan, charge 1% per trade – but Snorter lowers this to 0.85% for users holding a minimum balance of SNORT tokens. The bot also offers automated sniping, allowing users to input a token or pool address and auto-buy as soon as liquidity appears. Snorter Token Price Prediction Show This Solana Trading Bot Could Quickly 6x! Snorter Bot uses a custom RPC cluster with MEV-resistant relayers, making trades faster and more secure. The team is also working on adding limit orders, portfolio dashboards, honeypot detection, and copy-trading functions. SNORT holders can already stake their tokens and earn up to 174% APY, with governance rights and special holder rewards also planned for the future. Due to the token’s clearly defined utility, analysts such as ClayBro believe SNORT could soar by 6x quickly. With over $2.3 million already raised, Snorter has proven itself as a top meme coin presale token to watch right now.

2025-07-26T09:02:07,"Everyone Thinks Bitcoin Will Peak Soon, But This Analyst Says ‘Everyone Is Wrong’ “The Real Peak Date and Price…”","Cryptocurrency analyst Mark Moss made striking statements about the future of Bitcoin (BTC). Moss’s assessment highlights the PI Cycle Top indicator, which has correctly predicted Bitcoin’s cycle tops three times in the past. Moss noted that the PI Cycle Top indicator, which he said “perfectly” predicted the peaks of 2013, 2017, and 2021, has made a rather unusual prediction this time. According to the analyst, while the majority of the market expects Bitcoin to peak in the last quarter of 2025, the PI Cycle Top indicator puts that date at the first quarter of 2027. The analyst's estimated potential price level is striking: $395,000. Related News: Analytics Firm Issues Warning: Unusual Data Coming in Bitcoin Options - Here's What It Signals Referring to the past success of this indicator, Moss said that the new forecast should be taken seriously, adding, “Is the indicator still working accurately, or has it become obsolete? Only time will tell.” Moss also noted that the market is increasingly racing to accumulate more Bitcoin, with borrowing and BTC purchases through publicly traded companies increasing. In this context, he posed the following question, referring to the founders of XRP: “While the world is racing to acquire as much BTC as possible, why are XRP founders selling their holdings?” *This is not investment advice.
