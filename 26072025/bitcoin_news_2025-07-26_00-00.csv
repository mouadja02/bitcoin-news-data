2025-07-25T21:45:35,"Tyler Winklevoss accuses JPMorgan of halting Gemini's onboarding after he criticized the bank","Tyler Winklevoss is accusing JPMorgan Chase of halting efforts to onboard his crypto company, Gemini, after he publicly criticized the bank on X. The comments came on July 19, shortly after Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan had decided to start charging fintech companies for access to their users‚Äô banking data. Tyler said this new policy would financially destroy fintechs that help people link their bank accounts to platforms like Gemini. Tyler took his frustration to X, tagging Jamie Dimon, the bank‚Äôs chief executive, in his post. ‚ÄúSorry Jamie Dimon, we‚Äôre not going to stay silent,‚Äù Tyler wrote . ‚ÄúWe will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right!‚Äù The complaint wasn‚Äôt just about the fees. Tyler claimed JPMorgan‚Äôs response to his post was to pause Gemini‚Äôs onboarding process entirely. That decision, he said, was an intentional act of retaliation. And it‚Äôs not the first time this has happened. JPMorgan dropped Gemini before Trump backed crypto Years before Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly approach took hold, JPMorgan had already told Gemini to find another bank. The firm considered Gemini unprofitable at the time and dumped it. Tyler pointed out that this long-standing friction has now resurfaced, and it‚Äôs happening again under different circumstances, this time, right after he criticized them publicly. Tyler and his twin brother, Cameron Winklevoss, both supported Donald Trump‚Äôs last campaign. In 2025, they have also been present at multiple White House events during Trump‚Äôs current term. This renewed access to Washington comes as his administration supports policies that reduce regulatory pressure on crypto companies. While Tyler‚Äôs comments were blunt, they‚Äôre not totally unexpected. Jamie Dimon has built a reputation for trashing crypto over the years. In the past, he called bitcoin a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and even told the press that if any JPMorgan trader bought bitcoin, they‚Äôd be fired. He also labeled the asset class as useful only to criminals. But in a surprising turn, JPMorgan is now looking to enter crypto lending. JPMorgan quietly prepares crypto lending plans Even as Tyler blasts the bank for hurting crypto firms, JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to offer crypto-backed loans. The bank is planning to begin lending directly against bitcoin and ether, possibly as early as next year. The plan could include using crypto as collateral, something most traditional banks, including Goldman Sachs, still don‚Äôt do. The bank already lends against crypto ETFs, and this would be the next step. Although no formal announcement has been made, Dimon‚Äôs public tone has shifted. Speaking in May, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it.‚Äù That was a dramatic change from his older stance. The internal pivot at JPMorgan may be due to alienation from wealthy clients who built their portfolios through crypto. Tyler believes their current approach, charging fintechs for access to banking data, shows the bank still doesn‚Äôt want crypto firms in its space, especially those that dare criticize its policies. Gemini isn‚Äôt standing still. Earlier this year, it confidentially filed for an initial public offering, according to Bloomberg, which says the firm could list before year-end, depending on how quickly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wraps up its ongoing investigation. In January, Gemini settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, agreeing to pay $5 million. Gemini was founded in 2015 by Tyler and Cameron after their legal fight with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of the social network. Since then, they‚Äôve built Gemini into one of the most well-known crypto exchanges in the U.S., despite frequent regulatory battles and banking challenges. Tyler‚Äôs accusations come at a moment when political sentiment in Washington has actually changed for the first time ever. After years of uncertainty under Biden, crypto firms are gaining momentum. The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the first major crypto law to regulate stablecoins. Trump signed the bill into law the very next day. That change could open the door for more crypto-focused financial products, even from banks like JPMorgan. But as far as Tyler is concerned, the fight is now about banks silencing their critics. And this time, the target is clear.

2025-07-25T21:45:15,"Christie‚Äôs Real Estate Opens New Division for Crypto Investors","Christie‚Äôs International Real Estate, a well-established brokerage, has launched a new division specializing in the sale of crypto real estate . This unit is designed to help buyers and sellers complete property deals using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin (BTC), instead of traditional currency. This move puts Christie‚Äôs ahead in the housing market as crypto becomes more critical in global finance. A Dedicated Team for Crypto Real Estate Transactions Christie‚Äôs International Real Estate is now the first major U.S. luxury brokerage to establish a dedicated team for crypto transactions. The team includes lawyers, financial analysts, and crypto specialists. This new division is led by Aaron Kirman, the chief executive of the Christie‚Äôs group based in Los Angeles. Kirman decided to launch the division after several luxury homes were successfully sold using virtual assets. He stated that the transaction was completed smoothly, reinforcing his view that digital currency will play an increasingly significant role in property sales. The new team will assist with legal paperwork, digital payment processing, and the protection of client identities. This will enable high-value transactions to be completed securely without relying on traditional banks. Kirman is now in talks with several major banks to allow homes to be financed to accept cryptocurrency. He believes that within five years, more than one-third of all home purchases in the U.S. will involve some form of digital currency. Crypto‚Äôs Growing Role in U.S. Policy The decision by Christie‚Äôs comes at a time when the U.S. government is showing strong support for digital currency. President Trump recently signed the Genius Act , which introduces clear rules for stablecoins. The House of Representatives has also passed the Clarity Act, which aims to protect the crypto industry from strict regulations. This bill is currently awaiting review by the Senate. These policy changes follow a series of executive actions promoting digital finance. President Trump, whose personal holdings in cryptocurrency are estimated to be $7.1 billion, has publicly supported the broader use of digital assets. His family‚Äôs crypto-focused company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is set to begin trading soon , has also experienced significant growth. Crypto Mainstream Adoption Accelerates With increasing federal support, cryptocurrency is becoming an integral part of the housing market. In June, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said it is considering crypto holdings when evaluating mortgage applications. Industry leaders, such as Cathie Wood, have publicly endorsed this proposal , stating that it will give cryptocurrency a larger role in the U.S. financial system. Although crypto-based real estate transactions are still uncommon, interest is rising, especially among wealthy individuals. Additionally, major real estate companies, such as Cardone Capital, are entering the world of digital assets . In June, the company acquired 1,000 BTC, worth over $101 million. It became the first real estate investment firm to fully integrate a Bitcoin strategy into its treasury.

2025-07-25T21:36:51,"BTC and XRP show low retail sentiment, making them potential buy-low opportunities","The crypto market is seeing Bitcoin and XRP as potential buy-low opportunities, according to on-chain analytics firm Santiment. Retail traders are showing far less excitement toward Bitcoin and XRP compared to Ethereum, seemingly more interested in the latter‚Äôs price movements heading into the weekend. Santiment feed shared a social data chart on X Friday that shows an imbalance in how retail users are talking about the top three cryptocurrencies on social media. Santiment Feed Retail Crowd Social Mentions chart. Source: Santiment Ethereum leads the sentiment index by a 2.53 to 1 ratio of bullish to bearish calls. The high level of optimism is interpreted as evidence of Ether crowd FOMO, fear of missing out, which can often precede price corrections for the associated asset. On the flipside, Bitcoin and XRP showed more muted sentiment readings of 1.33 to 1 and a 1.11 to 1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, respectively. Santiment analysts note that such conditions often create entry points, as markets tend to move against the majority‚Äôs expectations. Ethereum is more vulnerable to reversal, while BTC and XRP‚Äôs lower enthusiasm levels could create room for an upside price acceleration. Bitcoin nears all-time highs, could see gains Despite having a relatively neutral sentiment, Bitcoin has kept its strides near the all-time high $123,000 level. Over the past week, it has traded within a tight band between $123,120 and $123,471, after days of aggressive gains earlier in the month. The largest coin by market cap now points to a possible transitional phase for the market, closing Friday‚Äôs trading session. Funding rates across major derivatives exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Bybit, Deribit, BitMEX, and HTX, have been neutral to slightly positive. The absence of extreme long positioning or excessive leverage could mean traders are in a ‚Äùwait and see‚Äù stance, hoping for a clear price direction. According to CryptoQuant contributor Nino, the market behavior is a seasonal lull in activity often referred to as the ‚Äúsummer doldrums,‚Äù which can precede heightened volatility later in Q3 2025. Exchange inflows show institutional activity up during price peaks Over the period between July 22 and July 25, Bitcoin‚Äôs price ranged from $115,000 to $119,500, peaking on July 24 at 16:00 before dropping to around $115,000 by the morning of July 25. CryptoQuant‚Äôs exchange inflow data reveals there was more activity from large holders at the time, particularly in the mid-to-large value bands. Wallets holding between 10 and 100 BTC recorded spikes in exchange deposits around the price peak on July 24. BTC Exchange Inflow chart. Source: CryptoQuant Similarly, wallets in the 100 to 1,000 BTC and 1,000 to 10,000 BTC bands had high numbers of inflows at the same time, suggesting that large stakeholders may have contributed to the price movement through profit-taking or repositioning. Smaller transactions, those between 0.01 and 1 BTC, were steady throughout the period, but inflows from addresses holding over 10,000 BTC remained minimal, although a slight uptick was registered during the July 24 peak. XRP low social interest could spark short-term rally Meanwhile, XRP has a subdued social media sentiment, as it ranks lowest among the three assets tracked by Santiment. The 1.11 to 1 bullish-to-bearish commentary ratio suggests that few traders are currently paying attention to XRP‚Äôs potential. XRP‚Äôs price has not dropped below $2.99 in the last seven days, and bulls and bears haven‚Äôt had enough impact to sway the token in either direction by much. Per Santiment‚Äôs analysis, this lack of attention may itself become a bullish indicator. XRP has previously staged price recoveries during times of low engagement, and current conditions may be setting the stage for a similar move.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $181.82 (-1%) Market Cap $97.90 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $9.02 Billion Circulating Supply 538.31 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $205.87 24-hour Low $187.09 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $153.91 200-Day SMA $163.72 Price Prediction $412.15¬†(118.42%) F & G Index 34.79¬†(fear) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 14-Day RSI 83.82 Solana price analysis: SOL falls to $180 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows volatility around $180 Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for July 25 shows that SOL failed to climb past $190, resulting in a sharp crash back to $180. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL faces strong bearish pressure Solana despite crossing past the $190 resistance found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technical suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed in the last few days. Currently the price has fallen to $181 but is yet to find a support at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 57.99, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising bearish pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market as SOL falls back to $180. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady rise as the bulls aimed to hold above the $190 price level. However, the recent crash suggests a retracement back to the $180 region suggesting consolidation at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows falling bearish momentum at -1.73, with the indicator showing rising bullish pressure with recent candles. This suggests that SOL may have found a support at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) fell to 43.49, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downwards direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $180 level.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour charts indicates minor resistance around $203. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $180, SOL can be expected to hold at $180, a key level that has been defended previously. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana, despite crossing past the $180 resistance, found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technicals suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed in the last 72-hours. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-25T21:11:00,"Bitcoin Pulls Back, Leaving A Mixed Sentiment In Crypto Markets (Technical Analysis)","Summary Altcoins are recovering from their past few harsh sessions ‚Äì Cardano is a surprise laggard. Bitcoin has retraced back towards the $115,000 pivot zone mentioned in our past analysis, and despite being just above 5% from its $123,200, sentiment is still mostly positive. ETH is consolidating close to its $3,860 highs, currently also above 5.70% from its recent top, but the lack of strong selling momentum within the correction shows that bulls are not ready to give up their hand yet. XRP has gone through a rough 17% correction after marking new all-time highs at $3.66. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrencies are coming off a spectacular run, and despite taking time, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) did grab some of the market share that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had amassed. The most popular cryptocurrencies had taken a Lance Armstrong, all-by-himself run throughout the beginning of 2025. Consistent ETF inflows, leading to strong institutional demand, created a stream of support to push up prices for BTC. Then, progressively, the same thing spread to ETH, which had been lagging considerably - touching lows at $1,363 in April for those who were not watching. There are some ongoing signs of profit taking, however, with the Whales (between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC) securing some profits at the all-time highs. Some funds and exchanges are doing the same, but not in a panic fashion. Profit taking is standard in such a market, particularly with cryptos, notably altcoins, attaining unseen highs in this cycle. For those who did not know, July 30 will mark the six months of the 180-day executive order to make a report on currencies from the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Assets. This is generally good news for the adoption of crypto but impairs its independence. The blockchain will, anyway, keep its integrity. Let‚Äôs look at Bitcoin charts amid this retracement and other major altcoins. Daily Crypto Market overview Cryptocurrencies Performance Board ‚Äì Source: Finviz Altcoins are recovering from their past few harsh sessions ‚Äì Cardano ( ADA-USD ) is a surprise laggard. Bitcoin 8H Chart Bitcoin 8H Chart, July 24 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView Bitcoin has retraced back towards the $115,000 pivot zone mentioned in our past analysis, and despite being just above 5% from its $123,200, sentiment is still mostly positive. Retracements are healthy in any trends, and price action still does not show signs of a longer-run top ‚Äì The situation stays the same as long as BTC holds above the $110,000 to $112,000 previous ATH support. Consolidating around these levels would still be more bullish than bearish; however, watch the $115,300 8H-MA 50 that would need to hold for bulls to keep their hands on the ongoing short-term trend. The triangle formation is interesting but does not infer much in terms of direction, so monitor potential breakouts both to the upside and the downside Ethereum 8H Chart Ethereum 8H Chart, July 24 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView ETH is consolidating close to its $3,860 highs, currently also above 5.70% from its recent top but the lack of strong selling momentum within the correction shows that bulls are not ready to give up their hand yet. The rebound right above $3,500 was a bullish wick, and with the 20-period MA ($3,650) catching up, there might be a strong move cooking in the markets. Watch for any break below on strong volume for a retracement, also spot if the newfound bull momentum is stocks from today's session brings up some buying flows in the Ether. Solana 8H Chart Solana 8H Chart, July 24 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView Solana saw a more thorough, 15% retracement from its local top ($206.5), but looking out to the bigger picture, buyers are stepping in at the middle of the longer-run upwards channel formed from the April lows to the May preceding highs. From here, look at $175 as a key barometer for bulls to hold ‚Äì Prices crossing above the $185 momentum pivot would recreate strong immediate momentum ‚Äì The altcoins are doing nicely today so bulls would want the lows from today to be the intermediate lows.Any break from here would leave bears in relative strength. XRP 8H Chart XRP 8H Chart, July 24 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView XRP ( XRP-USD ) has gone through a rough 17% correction after marking new all-time highs at $3.66 ‚Äì Nevertheless, price action staying above the $3.00 Major Pivot region will prompt further bullish action. Keep that zone (+/- $0.30) in check for imminent bull/bear strength ‚Äì The RSI is showing a rounding higher, which would give bulls a slightly higher probability of winning the battle, as long as momentum stays positive for the global market.S afe Trades!

2025-07-25T21:00:57,"This Australian Investment Manager Just Added Bitcoin To Its Treasury, Here‚Äôs How Much BTC They‚Äôve Bought","DigitalX Limited, an Australian digital Investment manager, has made headlines with a new Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, signaling renewed institutional confidence in the market. The ASX-listed crypto fund manager has expanded its Bitcoin treasury by a whopping 74.7 BTC, marking a significant addition to its already existing holdings. DigitalX Buys 74.7 BTC In a recent X social media post on July 23, DigitalX confirmed the addition of 74.7 BTC to its treasury. The acquisition, completed at an average price of $117,293 per BTC, reflects the company‚Äôs ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-led strategy. This latest purchase has raised the crypto fund manager‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 499.8 BTC, valued at approximately $91.3 million. Related Reading: Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX Moves Bitcoin Holdings For The First Time In 3 Years, Here‚Äôs Where It Went Notably, the company also announced and expanded on the details of this large-scale Bitcoin purchase in an official statement on Investorhub. Of its total 499.8 BTC holdings, 306.8 BTC are held directly by DigitalX, while the remaining 193 coins are held indirectly through 881,000 units in its ASX-listed Bitcoin ETF, BTXX. The recent addition of 74.7 Bitcoin follows an earlier acquisition of 57.5 BTC disclosed by the company on July 18, 2025. These back-to-back purchases demonstrate a continued reallocation of DigitalX‚Äôs digital asset treasury toward Bitcoin. The firm‚Äôs total treasury, excluding cash, now exceeds $104.4 million. As part of its long-term crypto strategy, DigitalX‚Äôs targeted portfolio adjustment reinforces its role as a leading institutional-grade Bitcoin investment vehicle on the Australian Securities Exchange. The crypto fund manager highlights its latest acquisition as a key step in its ongoing effort to establish Bitcoin as its core treasury reserve asset. Shareholder Focus Sharpens As Bitcoin Treasury Value Rises According to its official statement, DigitalX‚Äôs strategy goes beyond simply growing its BTC reserve. It also aims to enhance shareholder value through consistent and transparent reporting. The crypto fund manager now tracks its Bitcoin holdings per share in Satoshis (Sats), the smallest unit of BTC. Related Reading: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High As of the latest update, DigitalX‚Äôs BTC per share stands at 33.88 Sats, marking a 58% increase in its Bitcoin treasury value since June 30, 2025. This figure reflects the impact of recent acquisitions and provides a somewhat measurable benchmark for investors assessing exposure to the company‚Äôs considerable portfolio. By prioritizing Bitcoin accumulation and optimizing its treasury structure, DigitalX continues to position itself as a prominent crypto-centric firm‚Äîone that views shareholder value as directly tied to the strength and growth of its BTC holdings. The company is also doubling down on its long-term vision of leveraging the flagship cryptocurrency as a strategic financial foundation. Leigh Travers, former CEO and present Non-Executive Chairman of DigitalX, reaffirmed the company‚Äôs commitment to its digital asset goals, stating that it aims to steadily grow its BTC portfolio throughout the year and well into the future.

2025-07-25T20:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Unleashed: BTC Soars Past $117,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Unleashed: BTC Soars Past $117,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, surging past the significant $117,000 mark. This impressive rally has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, sparking renewed optimism across the digital asset landscape. What exactly is fueling this remarkable ascent, and what does it mean for the future of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency? What‚Äôs Driving the Bitcoin Price Surge Beyond $117,000? The recent monumental rise in Bitcoin price isn‚Äôt a random event; it‚Äôs the culmination of several powerful factors converging to create a bullish environment. Understanding these catalysts is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding crypto market. Institutional Inflows: A significant driver has been the continued influx of institutional capital. Major financial players, including hedge funds and corporations, are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions has further streamlined this process, making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure without directly holding the asset. Halving Hype and Scarcity: The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs halving events continues to play a pivotal role. These programmed reductions in the reward for mining new blocks emphasize Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent scarcity. As the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases, while demand potentially rises, the fundamental economics point towards upward price pressure. This narrative creates a strong psychological effect on the market. Macroeconomic Landscape: Global economic conditions, including concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies, are pushing investors towards alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô offers a decentralized and limited supply asset that can potentially preserve wealth in uncertain times. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and increasing adoption of the Lightning Network, enhance its utility and efficiency. A more robust and user-friendly network naturally attracts more participants, bolstering confidence in its long-term viability and, consequently, its price. Analyzing the $117,000 Milestone for Bitcoin Price Reaching $117,000 is not just another number on the chart; it represents a psychological and technical milestone for the Bitcoin price . This level, while not an all-time high, signifies strong buying pressure and a break past previous resistance points, which often turn into new support levels. Historically, such breakouts tend to attract more buyers, creating a positive feedback loop. Market monitoring by various sources, including what Bitcoin World has observed, indicates that BTC‚Äôs trading volume has surged alongside its price, particularly on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market. High trading volumes during a price ascent suggest strong conviction among buyers, rather than a fleeting speculative pump. This sustained interest points to a healthier rally. To put this into perspective, let‚Äôs look at the market dynamics: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Price Current Observation Supply Dynamics (Halving) Reduces new supply, increases scarcity value. Anticipation building for next halving cycle. Demand Drivers (ETFs, Institutions) Increases mainstream adoption and investment. Significant institutional capital flowing in. Market Sentiment Positive news fuels investor confidence. Overwhelmingly bullish sentiment post-$117,000. Global Macroeconomics Inflation concerns drive demand for hard assets. Bitcoin seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? Navigating Volatility While the current momentum is strong, the sustainability of any rally, including this impressive Bitcoin price surge, is always a key question for investors. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and sharp corrections can follow rapid gains. However, several factors suggest that this rally might have more fundamental underpinnings than previous speculative bubbles. Benefits of the Current Environment: Broader Participation: The market is no longer dominated by retail investors. Institutional involvement brings more stability and long-term investment horizons. Increased Utility: Bitcoin‚Äôs use cases are expanding beyond just a store of value, with growing acceptance for payments and as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi). Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, regulatory frameworks in many countries are becoming clearer, reducing uncertainty for large-scale investors. Potential Challenges and Risks: Profit-Taking: After significant gains, some investors may choose to take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected shifts in global economic policy or interest rates could impact risk asset appetite. Regulatory Surprises: Despite progress, unforeseen regulatory actions in major economies could still create market jitters. Actionable Insights for Investors: For those looking to participate or already invested, a balanced approach is key. Consider the following: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Resources like Bitcoin World‚Äôs market analysis can be invaluable. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Price: What Lies Ahead? The journey of the Bitcoin price has been nothing short of extraordinary, and its future remains a topic of intense debate and speculation. While predicting exact price points is impossible, understanding the broader trends can help investors prepare for what lies ahead. Many analysts believe that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its adoption curve. As digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a foundational asset is likely to strengthen. Factors such as increasing internet penetration, growing digital literacy, and the ongoing shift towards a more digital economy all bode well for its long-term prospects. The innovation within the crypto space is relentless. New applications, improved infrastructure, and a growing developer community continuously enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and appeal. This organic growth, coupled with its finite supply, positions Bitcoin as a compelling asset for the decades to come. However, the path will not be without its bumps. Market corrections are a natural part of any asset‚Äôs lifecycle, and Bitcoin will undoubtedly experience them. Geopolitical events, technological breakthroughs by competing cryptocurrencies, and shifts in global economic power could all influence its trajectory. Therefore, a long-term perspective, coupled with continuous learning and adaptive strategies, will be crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of the Bitcoin price . Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The surge of Bitcoin price past $117,000 marks a significant moment in its history, reflecting robust demand, increasing institutional acceptance, and a growing belief in its long-term value proposition. While volatility remains an inherent characteristic of the crypto market, the underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent appear stronger than ever before. This rally is not just about a number; it‚Äôs about the maturation of an asset class that is steadily carving out its indispensable role in the global financial ecosystem. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, it offers both exhilarating opportunities and important lessons in prudent investing. The future for Bitcoin looks bright, but informed decisions and a long-term vision will be paramount for those who wish to partake in its ongoing journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is driving the current Bitcoin price rally?

2025-07-25T20:46:11,"Bitwise CIO Declares ‚ÄúFour-Year Crypto Cycle Is Dead‚Äù‚ÄîIs a Steady, Record-Breaking Boom Next?","Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan says the long-observed four-year crypto cycle may no longer apply to the current market. In a recent discussion with Bitcoin advocate Kyle Chass√© and Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, Hougan argued that the historical pattern is breaking down, and a longer, more sustained growth phase could be on the horizon. Traditionally, crypto markets have followed a four-year rhythm driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs halving events, shifting interest rates, and the cyclical blow-ups that have rattled the industry. But Hougan believes these drivers are now losing influence. Matt Hougan Predicts ‚ÄòSustained Boom‚Äô for Crypto as Traditional Cycles Fade In a follow-up post on X , Hougan pointed to the diminishing impact of the Bitcoin halving , noting that each one has half the effect of the last. ‚ÄúThe halving is half as important every four years,‚Äù he said. Why is the four-year cycle dead? 1) The forces that have created prior four-year cycles are weaker: i) The halving is half as important every four years; ii) The interest rate cycle is positive for crypto, not negative (as it was in 2018 and 2022); iii) Blow-up risk is‚Ä¶ https://t.co/F9ybjHEeB5 ‚Äî Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 25, 2025 The rationale is simple: as block rewards diminish in absolute terms, their effect on overall market supply shrinks relative to the growing scale of the crypto economy. As such, halvings no longer serve as the singular driving force behind bullish market cycles. He also noted how interest rate cycles, once a severe headwind for crypto in downturns like 2018 and 2022, are now acting as tailwinds, buoyed by a more stable and accommodative macro environment. Hougan further emphasized that the risk of blowups, which had once controlled cycles in the crypto space, has been greatly reduced due to the shift to improved regulation and growing institutional involvement. In place of the old cycle, Hougan sees new forces taking hold, ones that move on longer timelines and aren‚Äôt tied to halving years. At the top of the list is the growing inflow of capital into crypto-related ETFs . That wave, which started in 2024 , is just beginning, he said, and could last five to ten years. Institutional adoption is another key trend. Hougan said pensions, endowments, and national account platforms are only starting to embrace crypto exposure. He expects that trend to accelerate as more crypto ETFs win approval. He also pointed to progress on the regulatory front. In his view, January 2025 marked the beginning of a new era of policymaking for the industry. Hougan cited the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this month as a major shift. As GENIUS Act passes, regulatory paths stabilize across jurisdictions and digital assets may find stronger footing for long-term planning. #genius #stablecoin https://t.co/Hdq2wceITt ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 The legislation has opened the door for Wall Street to begin building financial products around crypto, he said, predicting that banks will invest billions over the coming years. In his post, Hougan added that new developments such as the rise of crypto treasury firms holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets are shaping a different kind of cycle. He believes these emerging patterns won‚Äôt follow the sharp booms and busts of the past. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more of a sustained steady boom than a supercycle,‚Äù Hougan wrote. ‚ÄúThe long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic four-year cycle forces.‚Äù Looking ahead, he believes 2026 will be a strong year for crypto, although he warned that volatility is still expected. Bitwise CIO Sees Bitcoin on Path to $1M Amid Policy Shifts and Growing Institutional Support This is not the first time Hougan has believed that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of institutional adoption, marked by major shifts in finance and policy. On December 13, 2024, Hougan pointed to several key developments signaling this shift : BlackRock‚Äôs suggested 2% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin, the rapid uptake of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and growing public support from financial leaders like Ray Dalio. He also noted the increasing political acceptance of crypto, noting President Donald Trump‚Äôs vocal backing of Bitcoin and his appearance at a major industry event . Forward to this year, Hougan predicted Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, driven by demand from sovereign wealth funds, public companies, and institutional investors. Despite the controversy surrounding Trump's proposed US crypto reserve allocation, Bitwise CEO @Matt_Hougan believes the ‚Äúmarket has this wrong.‚Äù #Altcoin #DonaldTrump #Crypto https://t.co/rW2zJpsVaC ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 5, 2025 ‚ÄúThe final barrier fell when governments became holders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs survival was no longer in doubt; growth became the focus.‚Äù Hougan maintains that Bitcoin is now in a new phase, less speculative and more institutional and structural.
