2025-07-26T18:48:30,"Galaxy Quietly Executes a $9.6 Billion Bitcoin Sale, And the Market Barely Blinked","In what might go down as one of the largest BTC sales in crypto history, Galaxy Digital just helped move over 80,000 Bitcoin, worth more than $9.6 billion,on behalf of a Satoshi-era whale. No slippage. No liquidations. No panic. Just a flawless off-exchange execution that showcased the new face of crypto market maturity. A Whale From the Early Days These weren’t just any coins. They belonged to one of Bitcoin’s earliest miners, someone who accumulated BTC back in 2009–2010, when most of the world hadn’t even heard the word “blockchain.” For years, these wallets sat dormant. Then, in the past week, they finally moved. The reason? Estate planning. Sources say the seller is an original HODLer managing generational wealth. And Galaxy stepped in as the architect of that transition. A whale sold 80,000 $BTC via Galaxy Digital The early Bitcoin investor cashed out around $9 billion, marking one of the largest sales in crypto history. Interestingly, this sale had little impact on BTC price, which quickly rebounded back from the $115,000 level. pic.twitter.com/YHS3cEu3wR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 26, 2025 The entire transaction was handled via Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk,no open market exposure, no order book dumping. A clean block trade. Efficient. Silent. Professional. BTC Price Snapshot (via CoinMarketCap) Current Price: $117,500 (+2.1% 24h) Market Cap: $2.31 trillion 24h Volume: $35 billion Circulating Supply: 19.66 million BTC FDV: $2.46 trillion What’s stunning isn’t just the size,it’s the lack of impact. At most, BTC dipped to $115,000 before snapping back to $117,000 within hours. There was no flash crash, no cascading liquidations, just a smooth rebound. The market absorbed $9.6 billion without blinking, and that’s not luck; that’s structural strength. Why This Galaxy Sale Matters This wasn’t just a massive transaction. It was a litmus test. A sale of this scale, in earlier years, would’ve cratered the market. Even rumors of old wallets moving coins used to send Twitter (now X) into meltdown. But this time? Galaxy facilitated a historic exit,and no one got wrecked. It speaks volumes about how far crypto infrastructure has come. The ecosystem now boasts deep OTC liquidity, compliant execution desks, institutional-grade custody, and smart players managing exits with precision and discretion. A Shift in the On-Chain Lifecycle More than just a sale, this move signals a generational shift. The earliest Bitcoiners are no longer just HODLing. They’re creating estate plans, diversifying portfolios, and passing assets down. Crypto wealth is aging. But it’s also maturing, getting the same treatment as legacy assets. Galaxy is becoming a trusted bridge for that transition. Their role is evolving beyond exchange. They’re stepping into private wealth management, family office consulting, legacy planning,and doing it in stealth mode. Key Takeaways Market passed the stress test: $9.6B moved, price held firm. OTC desks are battle-tested: Galaxy’s execution was clean, quiet, and effective. Crypto is no longer just speculation: It’s inheritance. It’s legacy. It’s real wealth. This is likely just the beginning. More early wallets will awaken. More old-school holders will offload or restructure. But if the market can keep absorbing events like this with poise, Bitcoin is truly built to last. And Galaxy? They’re not just facilitating trades anymore. They’re managing eras.

2025-07-26T18:45:31,"Vanguard President Defies Consensus Expectations, Says US Equities Primed To Underperform Over the Long-Term: Report","The president and chief investment officer of the financial giant Vanguard isn’t particularly bullish on US stocks over the next decade. Gregory Davis tells Fortune in a new interview that US equities aren’t primed to continue raking in double-digit gains year after year. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that US equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future. Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The Vanguard president also argues that corporate profits have been abnormally high and aren’t likely to continue at that pace. Davis says the classic portfolio makeup of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has fallen out of whack for investors who haven’t rebalanced their holdings amid the longstanding equities bull market. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks. So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” He also notes that US stocks have beaten international equities by 6% a year over the past decade, further unbalancing investor portfolios. “So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Davis suggests investors should put 60% of their portfolios in bonds, 20% in foreign stocks and only 20% in US stocks over the next 10 years. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of US and foreign bonds as you’ll get in US equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side… What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” The Vanguard president also doesn’t suggest investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ), which he considers “speculation.” “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity. I t’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created. So I personally don’t get it. Vanguard won’t launch a Bitcoin fund. We just don’t see it as a core part of an investment portfolio.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-26T18:16:00,"Ethereum ETFs Log $452M Fresh Inflows In 16-Day Winning Streak","Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are having a great month. On July 25, the digital funds recorded another strong performance, pulling in over $452 million in new investments. This marks the 16th consecutive trading day that investors have added funds to these accounts. This indicates a steady and growing interest in Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BlackRock’s Fund Takes the Lead BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the way again , collecting $440.10 million in net inflows on Friday alone. The fund now manages $10.69 billion in assets, making it the most prominent spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. Other funds also saw positive movement, though on a smaller scale. Bitwise’s ETHW brought in $9.95 million, while Fidelity’s FETH added $7.30 million. However, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to struggle. It saw $23.49 million in withdrawals, raising its total outflow to $4.29 billion. This is the most significant loss among all Ethereum ETFs to date. Since launch, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen a total of $9.33 billion in net inflows, bringing their combined assets to $20.66 billion. This accounts for approximately 4.64% of Ethereum’s total market value. On July 24 alone, trading volume reached $1.5 billion. The most significant single-day inflow during this 16-day streak came on July 16, when investors added $726.74 million. Many other days in July have also seen inflows over $300 million . Why Investors Are Turning to ETH ETFs The steady inflow is driven by both retail and institutional investors , who are confident in Ethereum’s long-term value. They believe Ethereum’s role in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, and smart contracts lends it value beyond being just a cryptocurrency. According to Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, rising interest in stablecoins and tokenized assets is another reason demand for ETH ETFs is likely to stay strong. Hougan estimated that ETH exchange-traded products (ETPs) and related companies might buy as much as $20 billion worth of Ethereum in 2026. That would be around 5.33 million ETH at current prices. However, Ethereum’s network is expected to produce only about 0.8 million ETH in the same period. If Hougan’s prediction is right, demand could outpace supply by nearly seven times. Bitcoin ETFs Also Rebound While Ethereum is seeing a steady rise , Bitcoin ETFs also made a comeback on Friday. The investment funds attracted $130.69 million in new investments after a few days of outflows. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin ETFs saw $131.35 million pulled out on July 21, followed by smaller outflows on July 22 and 23. Despite this dip, Bitcoin ETFs still hold a strong position. Its total inflow now stands at $54.82 billion, with total net assets reaching $151.45 billion. July has been a generally positive month, with major inflows of over $1 billion recorded on both July 10 and 11.

2025-07-26T18:04:08,"Are US Banking Giants Taking Action Against Cryptocurrencies Again? Things Are Heating Up – Here Are the Details","US banking giant JPMorgan has reportedly suspended its customer onboarding process with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. This decision comes on the heels of a social media post by Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, in which he accused the bank of “trying to kill fintech and crypto companies.” In another post today, Winklevoss alleged that JPMorgan canceled Gemini's re-acceptance process because of a previous tweet by Winklevoss. In that tweet, Winklevoss warned that major banks were trying to bypass the Open Banking Rule, drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which takes effect at the end of 2024. This new regulation gives consumers the right to freely share their bank data with third-party platforms. Platforms like Plaid serve as a key bridge for transferring funds to cryptocurrency exchanges like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken. Related News: US President Donald Trump Sends Mixed Signals About the Economy - His Latest Statements Here Winklevoss made the following statement: “They want to quietly take away your right to free access to your banking data. We will not remain silent, Jamie Dimon. Sorry.” Some in the crypto industry are viewing this development as a new example of the long-discussed “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” This operation is described as an effort by regulators to indirectly pressure crypto companies to push them out of the financial system. While the debate subsided earlier this year with Trump-era reforms, recent developments have rekindled tensions. Ironically, JPMorgan has recently taken a more lenient approach to cryptocurrencies. According to a report last week by the Financial Times, the bank is exploring loan products directly collateralized by crypto assets like Bitcoin. This stance contradicts CEO Jamie Dimon's previous statements calling Bitcoin a “fraud.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-26T18:00:48,"Chainlink Ignites Bullish Momentum As BTC Dominance Slips—Breakout Brewing?","Providing fresh market insight on X, Cryptowzrd revealed that Chainlink ended the session on a bullish note, with signs pointing to further upside pressure. As LINKBTC gains momentum and Bitcoin’s dominance trend declines, the setup appears promising. Cryptowzrd noted he will be monitoring the intraday chart closely for the next scalp opportunity, particularly if LINK breaks above the intraday lower high trendline. Bitcoin Dominance Weakens: A Catalyst For Chainlink’s Surge According to Cryptowzrd, both LINK’s daily candle and the LINKBTC pair ended the day on a bullish note. This positive price action is drawing attention to the potential for further upside movement. Cryptowzrd emphasized that continued strength in LINKBTC, especially if fueled by ongoing weakness in Bitcoin Dominance, could help LINK gain significant bullish momentum from its current levels. Related Reading: Chainlink Sees Heavy Accumulation – Whales Add 8M LINK In One Month Looking ahead, the next major resistance target for LINK is set at $20. Cryptowzrd suggested that a firm hold above this level could act as a catalyst for a stronger rally toward higher resistance levels, possibly reaching $30 and beyond. The speed at which this move might unfold was another key point highlighted by Cryptowzrd. He expects that once LINK clears the $20 hurdle, the rally could accelerate rapidly, driven by increased bullish pressure and technical confirmation across multiple timeframes. While the outlook is bullish, Cryptowzrd also pointed out an important support zone to watch. The $16 level has been identified as the main daily support target. Holding above this area will be crucial to maintaining the current bullish structure and preventing any deeper pullbacks. Overall, Cryptowzrd’s analysis suggests that Chainlink is positioned for a potential breakout phase, with $20 acting as the immediate resistance to watch. If Bitcoin Dominance continues to weaken and LINKBTC remains strong, traders could see a swift and powerful rally unfold in the days ahead. Volatility Vs. Patience: Navigating LINK’s Weekend Setup Concluding his analysis, Cryptowzrd noted that LINK’s intraday chart experienced significant volatility in the last 24 hours, reflecting an uncertain short-term outlook. He expects this choppy price action to continue, but due to the lower trading activity typically seen over the weekend, his expectations remain rational. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Trigger: Why $16 Holds The Key To The Next Rally The key level to watch is $18.40, which serves as an intraday resistance target. According to Cryptowzrd, if Chainlink holds above this level, it could trigger a long setup aiming for a move toward $19.80 or higher in the near term. However, if LINK remains below $18.40, Cryptowzrd expects the price to stay range-bound with continued sideways movement over the weekend.
