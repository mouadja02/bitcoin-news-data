2025-07-26T11:45:32,"Institutional Investors Express Rising Confidence in Stocks Amid Increased Bearishness on the US Dollar: Goldman Sachs Survey","There‚Äôs a growing divergence between institutional investors‚Äô expectations for US stocks and the dollar, according to a new survey conducted by the financial giant Goldman Sachs. Goldman‚Äôs survey indicates investors are expressing increased bullishness on US stocks, particularly on Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, the large tech firms that make up the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven.‚Äù Conversely, the same institutional investors are demonstrating a surge in bearishness on the dollar amid US fiscal issues. Oscar √ñstlund, a managing director at Goldman, notes that dollar bears now outnumber bulls by a ratio of more than 7:1. ‚ÄúOne of the most important paradigm shifts over the last couple of months has been the decoupling of the dollar and US equities.‚Äù Source: Goldman Sachs Goldman‚Äôs investor survey has only clocked bearish dollar sentiment next to a bullish view on US stocks three times in the past 9.5 years. In terms of stocks, 51% of Goldman‚Äôs respondents were bullish on the S&P 500, while 32% were bearish. √ñstlund says that equity bullishness could suggest market vulnerability to a reversal. ‚ÄúA very one-sided position is a sign of a stretched market. In itself, a very strong consensus is not a reason for the market to turn, but it makes for a market that‚Äôs susceptible to relatively sudden changes based on even minor catalysts.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-26T11:29:26,"Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI","The post Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continue their steady climbs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto crowd with a unique blend of innovation and growth potential. Now entering Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the next moonshot candidate, with the ambition to outpace DOGE‚Äôs historical returns on investment. The limited availability in this phase combined with a thoughtfully engineered ecosystem is creating a perfect storm for a breakout run. Investors ready to seize this opportunity will find MUTM‚Äôs structure and roadmap hard to ignore. Stablecoin Depth and mtToken Staking: The Heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs decentralized stablecoin system will be built on a strict, controlled mint-and-burn model. Only authorized issuers will be able to mint stablecoins against blue-chip collateral such as ETH, and these stablecoins will be burned when borrowers repay their loans, ensuring the peg to $1 remains robust. Governance protocols will actively manage interest rates to maintain equilibrium, while automatic liquidations will protect the system from undercollateralization risks. This setup will foster a stable, reliable environment for both lenders and borrowers. What will truly set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its innovative mtToken mechanism. When users deposit assets like USDC or ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs smart contracts, they will receive corresponding mtTokens 1:1. These mtTokens will grow in value over time as interest accumulates. Moreover, staking mtTokens will unlock an additional layer of rewards: stakers will earn MUTM tokens purchased through open market buybacks funded by protocol revenue. This design will effectively tie token utility to the platform‚Äôs success, creating a continuous incentive for participation while boosting MUTM‚Äôs demand and value. Presale Snapshot and a Roadmap Set for Growth Phase 6‚Äôs launch at $0.035 has already generated $13.60 million, though only 5% of tokens have been claimed so far. Phase 7 is expected to mint 170 million tokens at $0.040, marking a 15% price increase that adds urgency for investors eyeing early entry. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, now held by over 14,400 wallets, reflecting a strong and growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs security credentials are impressive. The project earned a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, confirming a solid technical foundation. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program actively invites ethical hackers to safeguard the platform, while a $100,000 giveaway across ten backers creates additional community excitement. The project roadmap is equally compelling. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs Phase 6 Beta will launch concurrently with the token listing, unveiling the mint/burn stablecoin system alongside an automated rate engine that adjusts borrowing costs dynamically. Further phases promise cross-chain support, facilitating asset transfers beyond Ethereum‚Äôs network. Crucially, Layer 2 integration will slash transaction costs to near zero and speed execution to under a second, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs platform both efficient and scalable. Lending Mechanics that Appeal to Both Cautious and Risk-Tolerant Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expertly balance low-risk and higher-risk lending through its dual models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model will invite depositors to lend blue-chip tokens at competitive rates. For example, lending 2 BTC at a 9% APY will mint 240,000mtBTC tokens that will grow by 0.18 BTC annually. These mtBTC will be stakeable to collect additional MUTM rewards generated from protocol buybacks. Borrowers using P2C will be able to leverage their BTC collateral to draw 70% loan-to-value in stablecoins like USDT, allowing liquidity without selling assets. In contrast, the P2P model will cater to higher-risk appetite by facilitating direct loan agreements involving memecoins such as SHIB. Investors will be able to negotiate loans‚Äîsay, a 45-day SHIB loan at 32% APR‚Äîisolating these volatile assets from core pools and rewarding lenders with premium interest. Investor Case and Growing FOMO: The Clock Is Ticking History tends to repeat itself in crypto, and a seasoned investor who famously predicted DOGE‚Äôs 2020 rally is placing his bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). He swapped $5,000 worth of ETH into MUTM at just $0.015, acquiring 333,333 tokens valued at $11,666 today. This amount will jump to $20,000 at the listing price of $0.06. More thrilling is the forecasted surge to $1 per token, a staggering 100√ó gain, pushing his holdings to a remarkable $333,333. This optimistic price prediction is driven by the increasing MUTM demand driven by upcoming beta launch and real testing of platform usage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs thoughtful integration of stablecoin mechanisms, innovative mtToken staking rewards, and Layer 2 scalability coupled with a robust security framework and a clear growth roadmap positions it uniquely in today‚Äôs market. Investors seeking the next breakout token that blends safety, utility, and explosive upside will find MUTM‚Äôs Phase 6 offering impossible to overlook. The market is waiting for a new leader ‚Äî this $0.035 token is ready to answer the call For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below: Website: https://mutuum.com/ Linktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/next-crypto-to-hit-1-this-token-entered-phase-6-and-might-overtake-doge-in-roi/,"BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|TRADING|BTC","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-07-26T11:27:30,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano‚Äôs price is expected to surpass $1 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros‚Äîa unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano‚Äôs two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform‚Äôs future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you‚Äôre wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano‚Äôs ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let‚Äôs uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8236 Market Cap $29.19B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.06B Circulating Supply 35.4B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8287 24-hour Low $0.7777 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 17.01% 50-day SMA $0.6698 14-Day RSI 62.84 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $0.6115 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA is consolidating between $0.80-$0.83 with weakening momentum signals. Volume decline and bearish MACD divergence suggest sellers are gaining control. Cardano‚Äôs critical support lies at $0.77. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: ADA faces rejection at critical resistance Cardano‚Äôs daily chart on July 26, 2025, displays a rejection pattern after testing the upper Bollinger Band around $0.94, with the price currently consolidating near $0.8256. The strong red candle following the rally indicates selling pressure at this critical resistance level. The MACD also shows a bearish divergence with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting weakening momentum. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano sees sideways consolidation with declining volume The 4-hour chart supports the price consolidation on the broader timeframe, showing Cardano trapped in a tight range between $0.80 and $0.83 with notably declining volume as indicated by the OBV. The recent candles show indecision with mixed red and green sessions. The horizontal resistance at $0.8362 continues to cap upside attempts, and the declining volume pattern suggests market participants are waiting for a clear directional catalyst. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7394 BUY SMA 5 $0.8141 BUY SMA 10 $0.8290 SELL SMA 21 $0.7522 BUY SMA 50 $0.6698 BUY SMA 100 $0.6967 BUY SMA 200 $0.6115 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7335 BUY EMA 5 $0.7055 BUY EMA 10 $0.6860 BUY EMA 21 $0.6827 BUY EMA 50 $0.7125 BUY EMA 100 $0.7472 BUY EMA 200 $0.7229 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano is likely to continue consolidating with a bearish undertone following the rejection at key resistance and deteriorating momentum signals. The critical test lies at the $0.77 support level, where a decisive break could accelerate selling pressure toward $0.58. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano‚Äôs future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano‚Äôs recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin‚Äôs future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that‚Äôs over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA‚Äôs current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto‚Äôs craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn‚Äôt happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from¬†$10 to $50¬†or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform‚Äôs unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

By 2026, Cardano‚Äôs price could trade at a maximum of $2.45. Cardano‚Äôs historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52‚Äì$0.401 in April and $0.317‚Äì$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705. In July, the coin is trading between $0.7777 and $0.8287.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/,"ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS","Crypto Price Predictions|ADA",cryptocompare
2025-07-26T11:08:33,"3 Best Cryptos to Buy That Could Flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC in the Next Bull Run","The post 3 Best Cryptos to Buy That Could Flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC in the Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sometimes, all it takes is a penny investment. That‚Äôs the philosophy many early Bitcoin believers followed back in 2011. Now, seasoned crypto traders are looking to repeat history as BTC pushes past $130,000, attention shifts from chasing highs to finding the next big breakout coin. Analysts believe the real gains lie in the undervalued tokens still trading under a cent, with enough traction and upside to flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC by the next bull peak. Here‚Äôs why these tokens could be the best to do precisely that. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Chain With Layer-2 Power A trader who rode Bitcoin from the 2022 bottom to this year‚Äôs peak is now rotating gains into Little Pepe (LILPEPE) ‚Äî a low-cap Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-2 token currently in Stage 7 of its presale. At $0.0017, it has already climbed over 50% from its early-stage pricing, with $8.9 million raised and 6.7 billion tokens sold. Analysts believe that a jump to around $0.20 seems possible once the token lists. Stage 6 of the presale was gone in a flash, and Stage 7 is moving just as fast, showing that every second may count for new buyers. Instead of loading up on Bitcoin again, this move suggests a larger plan: using steady wins from top coins to free up cash for riskier, high-reward projects. And Little Pepe fits that mold ‚Äî not just for its fast Layer-2 network, but for its emphasis on community-first culture, sniper bot protection, and an innovative meme launchpad (Pump Pad). Its $777,000 giveaway, open to anyone contributing $100+ in the presale, has pulled in over 40,000 entries. The project‚Äôs visibility on CoinMarketCap and a strong Freshcoin.io audit score of 81.55 further validate its appeal. Most notably, its confirmed listing price of $0.003 means early buyers are looking at a guaranteed 2.14x return, even before price discovery. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Viking Doge That‚Äôs Building Beyond Memes FLOKI might not be under-the-radar anymore ‚Äî but it‚Äôs far from done. What began as a meme homage to Elon Musk‚Äôs Shiba Inu has matured into a serious Web3 ecosystem. Its developers have rolled out DeFi tools, NFT integrations, and a metaverse platform. Recent traction in meme coin trading and broader crypto recovery helped FLOKI regain attention, but the mix of utility and culture keeps it in play. FLOKI‚Äôs partnerships across multiple chains ‚Äî from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain ‚Äî and its aggressive marketing campaign make it one to watch for both short-term spikes and long-term protocol adoption. While it‚Äôs no longer in the sub-million-dollar range like LILPEPE, the team‚Äôs push toward real features ‚Äî combined with meme loyalty ‚Äî could help it outperform many larger-cap coins in the next cycle. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The NFT Mascot That Just Might Become a Meme Coin Giant PENGU trades around $0.021 with a $1.3 billion market cap, and while that puts it above early-stage tokens, its unique crossover position gives it enormous speculative power. Launched alongside its successful NFT series, Pudgy Penguins is tapping into mainstream adoption. It recently secured a decentralized ETF (Canary PENGU ETF), with listings on Revolut and Bitstamp, that pushed it into headlines. But what truly powers PENGU is its cultural relevance. From branded toys to community-driven storytelling, it‚Äôs become a household meme brand with global NFT traction. During one week alone, PENGU rallied over 80%, and with fresh exchange listings and ETF visibility, it‚Äôs becoming a case study for how memes, NFTs, and finance can collide. Conclusion: Timing Beats Talent in the Crypto Game The difference between a trader who 10x‚Äôd 0.1 BTC and one who didn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt always technical skill; most times it‚Äôs timing, conviction, and being early. While Bitcoin‚Äôs path to $140K might offer steady returns, exponential growth often lies with new narratives. Little Pepe‚Äôs explosive presale, Floki‚Äôs blend of meme and DeFi, and Pudgy Penguin‚Äôs brand power offer three roads to significant upside. For those looking to turn small bets into headline-worthy wins, these aren‚Äôt just coins, they‚Äôre chances. Now might be the time to act ‚Äî before the rest of the market catches up.

2025-07-26T11:00:28,"Massive Bitcoin Exchange Moves Hint at Market Shake-Up: Surge or Plunge Incoming?","Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally appears to be losing momentum, with the asset slipping by 2.4% over the past week and currently trading around $115,382. This marks a 6.1% drop from its all-time high above $123,000 reached earlier this month. While the decline has yet to indicate a confirmed trend reversal, on-chain data is signaling increased market activity and positioning as traders respond to the pullback. Exchange Activity Points to Market Repositioning According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader, recent inflows and outflows from exchanges are helping shape market sentiment. In a post titled ‚ÄúMassive Inflows Spark BTC Dump ‚Äî But Outflows Return,‚Äù the analyst highlighted that a notable inflow spike on July 17, totaling more than 32,000 BTC, signaled heightened sell-side pressure. The result was a sharp price decline, with Bitcoin temporarily dropping below $115,000. However, outflows have returned in recent days, raising the possibility of renewed accumulation . Enigma Trader noted that following the major inflow event, Bitcoin experienced a series of significant outflows across several days, totaling -7,400 BTC, -12,080 BTC, and -16,100 BTC. These outflows, which typically represent a shift from exchanges to wallets, may reflect either investor repositioning or an intent to hold, both of which reduce immediate selling pressure. The analyst suggested that if the outflow trend continues while Bitcoin remains near support, there could be potential for a bullish turnaround, especially if momentum is sustained. Supporting this view, historical patterns often show that sustained outflows correspond with increased investor confidence and longer-term holding behavior . Still, such behavior must be weighed against broader market conditions, including macroeconomic factors, risk sentiment, and regulatory developments. The current dynamic shows a balance between cautious optimism and short-term volatility. Record Open Interest Signals Speculative Activity Meanwhile, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain pointed out another layer to Bitcoin‚Äôs current market structure: open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has reached a new record high of $44.5 billion. Interestingly, this spike in open interest occurred as prices fell, indicating that many traders are initiating new positions during the dip. The analyst emphasized that while some may be placing long positions expecting a recovery, a considerable portion likely represents short bets on further downside. This combination, rising open interest during a declining price trend, raises the risk of liquidation events, especially if the market reverses direction abruptly. Arab Chain warned that high open interest under such conditions often suggests increased leverage use by speculators rather than long-term investors. This makes the market more sensitive to volatility, and sharp movements in either direction could trigger a cascade of liquidations.

2025-07-26T11:00:02,"Cathie Wood says ETH corporate shells create premium-yield crypto proxies","It seems like Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest is rewriting its crypto rulebooks. It suggests moving capital out of direct crypto exposure and into a new class of corporate shells that act as synthetic crypto proxies. While Wood mentions Ethereum and Robinhood, Ark has aggressively trimmed its holdings in Coinbase, HOOD, and Block. This comes in when Ethereum has gained more than 50% in the last 30 days. ETH price went to breach $3,800. Data shows that Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped by more than 37% over the last month to stand at $82.88 billion. It has finally outperformed Solana. This depicts an uptrend for staking on the Ether chain. Is this Crypto‚Äôs new leverage cycle? In an X post, Cathie Wood mentioned that Robinhood is offering a 2% match for crypto transfers. Looking at this chance, ‚ÄúVCs and other investors shifting staked ETH into Treasury companies (DATs) to double their money when lockups expire,‚Äù she added.
