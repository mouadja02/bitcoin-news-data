The government says it‚Äôs still buying BTC every day, but the IMF disagrees. This raises questions about how much Bitcoin is really helping and if the country‚Äôs original crypto vision is starting to fade. Locals Still Use BTC in Berlin In the mountain town of Berlin, El Salvador, locals are using Bitcoin daily, trading goods like coffee and benefiting from its rising price. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but under a 2024 IMF deal, its use became optional and limited for government use. Is Bitcoin Policy Helping The People? El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy is facing new challenges, says Quentin Ehrenmann of NGO My First Bitcoin. He told Reuters that after the IMF deal, Bitcoin lost its legal tender status, and the government stopped pushing public education or adoption efforts. While the government keeps adding to its Bitcoin reserves, he argues that this benefits the state more than everyday people. For more than two years in a small district in the eastern part of El Salvador, Bitcoin enthusiasts have created a learning center and provided technical support to owners of about 200 businesses and entrepreneurs on using the cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/S2bJ4YOYCf ‚Äî Reuters (@Reuters) July 25, 2025 Government Says ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre Still Buying‚Äô, IMF Disagrees The government holds over 6,249 BTC worth over $738M, but a 2024 survey showed 80% of Salvadorans feel Bitcoin has not improved their finances.¬†El Salvador agreed not to buy more Bitcoin under its IMF deal, according to a recent report. This clashes with statements from the country‚Äôs own Bitcoin Office, which claims BTC is still being bought daily. The country‚Äôs Bitcoin Office confirmed on July 24 that it bought 8 more BTC worth about $948,000. But, a recent IMF statement claims that the country has not made any purchases. EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/H5rbVvrodH ‚Äî The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) July 24, 2025 The IMF claims that the country has been moving coins between wallets, and not actually buying more BTC. These internal transfers, the IMF says, create the illusion of new purchases, even though the total Bitcoin held stays the same. They also pointed out that El Salvador‚Äôs national Bitcoin wallet system doesn‚Äôt always show accurate, real-time data, adding to the confusion. Bitcoin Doubts Grow in El Salvador John Dennehy also called recent wallet activity ‚Äúmisleading,‚Äù saying it‚Äôs just internal movement dressed up as fresh buys. However, the government hasn‚Äôt replied to the IMF‚Äôs criticism, and is focused on its bigger Bitcoin goals. El Salvador has scaled back public Bitcoin efforts to meet IMF loan terms. This shift has sparked doubts about the future of El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin policy.While some data shows daily 1 BTC transfers to government-linked wallets, it‚Äôs unclear if these are official purchases. At the same time, experts note that the Bitcoin treasury strategy might be losing its edge, with fewer gains left for new buyers.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/el-salvadors-bitcoin-strategy-faces-doubts-amid-imf-pressure-and-mixed-signals/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|TREASURY","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

The Eastern District says Truist Bank employee, Ahshah Dior Martin, stole $195,000 from at least 70 Truist Bank accounts. Martin started gathering banking information on her would-be victims in 2023 after improperly accessing the bank‚Äôs computer systems. ‚ÄúThen, she initiated fraudulent debits and withdrawals from these accounts for her own benefit. For instance, Martin repeatedly initiated payments from customer bank accounts to a child support payment processor, through which Martin paid herself.‚Äù The victims Martha stole from while working at Truist Bank were diverse and comprised of both individuals and entities, according to the Eastern District. They included ‚Äúmultiple churches, a children‚Äôs museum, an eye tissue bank non-profit organization, manufacturing and construction companies, a small business making customized holsters, and the North Carolina Wing of the Civil Air Patrol.‚Äù Truist Bank fired Martin in April of 2024 but she frustrated efforts by the eighth-largest US bank by total assets to retrieve the computer she had been issued at work. ‚ÄúTo conceal her wrongdoing and prevent the return of her Truist laptop, Martin faked her own death. On April 17, 2024, in response to an email from Truist asking for the computer, Martin responded, ‚ÄúSorry to inform you, she has passed away.‚Äù‚Äù The former Truist Bank employee spent the money she stole on ‚Äúcosmetic products, clothing, travel expenses, dining, and at a hookah bar,‚Äù the Eastern District says. Martin faces up to three decades in prison. She will be sentenced in November.

2025-07-26T14:30:07,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: 67% of BTC Still in Individual Hands ‚Äì What Does This Say About Price Potential?","Bitcoin‚Äôs price has demonstrated resilience, climbing above $118,000 after weathering significant selling pressure from whale activity. This recovery has sparked discussions among market participants about the extent to which large holders and long-dormant wallets influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Contrary to widespread assumptions about whale dominance, recent insight from River , a Bitcoin-focused financial institution, shows that more than 67% of all BTC remains under individual ownership rather than institutional control. 67% of #bitcoin is still owned by individuals. Wall Street, governments, and corporations? Just 13.8%. pic.twitter.com/EjvlnR5aHF ‚Äî TFTC (@TFTC21) July 24, 2025 Individual Ownership Powers Bitcoin as Indicator Flashes GREEN The distribution of Bitcoin ownership aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs original vision of decentralization , ensuring that ordinary people, rather than a concentrated group of institutions, maintain influence over the financial systems that affect their economic well-being. Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain strength above $117,000 during the recent whale selling episode demonstrates such a belief. The cryptocurrency has now successfully closed above critical bullish territory, completing the CME gap fill at $115,000. $BTC just did what we are not expecting. Closed above key Bullish zones. CME gap at $115K was filled. High Leverage Rekt out. Institutions buying heavily their BAGS. This correction was very much needed for Bitcoin next higher high. The bulls are back again in beast mode.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/BAFFiDHc89 ‚Äî Henry (@LordOfAlts) July 26, 2025 Market momentum is now in the bulls‚Äô control, with Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory pointing toward a potential rally to $140,000 as the next significant milestone. Nevertheless, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets demands careful risk management. The Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI) has entered the Distribution zone after five months, a range historically linked to market euphoria and potential peaks. Importantly, the index has only reached the lower boundary of this zone at the 80% level, remaining well below the 100% threshold that previously signaled major cycle tops. Source: CryptoQuant This suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs targets of $140,000-$150,000 remain achievable, as aggressive profit-taking typically seen at cycle peaks has not yet materialized. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Elliott Wave Points to $131K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC/USD) daily chart reveals a developing Elliott Wave pattern, with the asset currently positioned in the early phases of Wave (V). The preceding waves (i) through (iv) have been completed according to established wave principles. Source: TradingView Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating just beneath the 9-day EMA at $118,016.64, which serves as immediate resistance. The emergence of a bull pennant or flag formation below this resistance level indicates potential for continued bullish momentum toward the projected Wave (V) target around $131,757. The RSI reading of 66.42 remains below overbought conditions, providing room for additional upward movement. This New Bitcoin Token Could 10X: $5M Raised While Bitcoin moves up and down between key price levels, a new project called Bitcoin Hyper is getting a lot of attention. This project is still in its early funding stage and has already raised over $5 million, showing that many investors believe in it. So what is Bitcoin Hyper? Think of it as an upgrade to regular Bitcoin. It‚Äôs built on what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù system, basically a newer technology that sits on top of Bitcoin to make it work better. This is the first project of its kind, which is why so many people are interested in buying in early. Several crypto experts think the $HYPER token could go up 10 times in value from the current price. Right now, early investors can buy $HYPER tokens for $0.0124 each. The price will increase as the project progresses through various funding stages, so purchasing early may result in a better deal.
