2025-07-26T19:35:46,"Goldman Sachs Warns Multi-Year US Dollar Depreciation Incoming","Banking titan Goldman Sachs believes the US dollar‚Äôs poor performance over the last few months is just the beginning of a downtrend that will likely last for years. In a new podcast, Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of global investment research Jan Hatzius calls the US dollar the ‚Äúdog that didn‚Äôt bark.‚Äù Hatzius says the US economy has stabilized since April, when the stock market plunged amid Trump‚Äôs trade war. However, he points out that the dollar has continued to weaken, depreciating even as the economy rebounds. The economist says the dollar‚Äôs bearish price action suggests it‚Äôs being driven by long-term structural factors rather than the near-term economic outlook. ‚ÄúThe dollar is still very highly valued on a broad trade-weighted basis, and that historically sets up for depreciation in the coming years. The US still runs a very large current account deficit that needs to be financed by equal-sized capital inflows. Then there are some of these more tail risk concerns around things like Fed independence that probably also have an impact on how foreign investors perceive investments in the US‚Ä¶ This is not about a fire sale. It‚Äôs about making it a little bit more difficult to obtain the capital inflows that are needed to cover the current account deficit.‚Äù In April of this year, Hatzius said that the US had a current account deficit of $1.1 trillion, which needed to be financed by foreign investments in US assets such as Treasuries and equities. The current account deficit exists because the US spends more than it earns from the global economy. By consuming more than it produces, the country relies on foreign investment to bridge the gap. But when foreign funding slows, pressure builds on the dollar as capital flows outward, increasing the global supply of USD and contributing to its devaluation. At time of writing, the US dollar index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, is down about 10% year-to-date.

2025-07-26T19:30:13,"XRP Produces Successful $3 Support Retest ‚Äì  But What Next?","Renowned market expert with X username CasiTrades has shared an interestingly bullish insight on the XRP market. Notably, this price forecast comes following a broader crypto market correction in the past week, during which XRP has registered a 6.74% price decline. XRP Bulls Eye Return To ATH After $3 Retest In an X post on July 25, CasiTrades shows that XRP is on the brink of a major price surge based on the indications of the Elliot Wave Theory ‚Äì a technical framework that proposes that price movements occur in five repetitive waves. Amidst the price decline in the last week, XRP failed to hold above the critical $3.21 price level, forcing a retrace to retest the major $3.00 support zone, resulting in a slight price bounce. Despite this bearish event, the analyst notes encouragingly that the altcoin did not form a new price low, suggesting the larger bullish structure remains intact. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Basketball Legend‚Äôs Poll Puts Crypto On Center Court CasiTrades explains that XRP‚Äôs latest retracement reached a deep 0.854 Fibonacci level, a classic reversal zone for second waves in a bullish five-wave structure. This deep pullback, combined with the strong bounce off $3.00, signifies the potential bottom of Wave 2. If bulls can hold the price above this support, this sets the stage for the beginning of Wave 3, the strongest and most explosive leg in the Elliott Wave Theory. For context, the Elliot wave theory begins with an initial price rise, i.e, Wave 1, followed by Wave 2, a pullback that doesn‚Äôt breach the starting point. Wave 3 is usually the strongest and longest, driven by increased participation and bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Wave 4 brings another correction, often less severe than Wave 2, before Wave 5 pushes prices to a final high. For Wave 3 to commence in the present market, CasiTrades states the next price target lies at the $3.21 region, which represents a crucial resistance. If XRP produces a sustained breakout above this price barrier, it validates the proposed bullish scenario. In this case, the analyst identifies an immediate price target of $3.82, which aligns with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension of the prior move. Interestingly, this price zone also represents XRP‚Äôs all-time high on certain markets. This confluence strengthens confidence in the bullish scenario, especially considering that if the Elliott Wave structure plays out fully, a Wave 5 rally could propel the altcoin into uncharted price territory.

2025-07-26T19:11:02,"Bitcoin Hits $1T Realized Cap as Price Holds Above $118K After $9B BTC Sale by Satoshi-Era Whale","Bitcoin continues to trade above the $118,000 mark, holding steady after a week of significant institutional developments and a landmark milestone in on-chain metrics. According to CoinDesk Data, BTC was last up 1.45% over the past 24 hours, bringing its 30-day gain to 10.42% and lifting its year-to-date performance to more than 26%. Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted in its latest ""Week On-chain"" report that July has brought one of the strongest upside breakouts of the year. After dipping to around $105,400 earlier in the month, bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $122,700 before settling into a consolidation phase just below that level. The report noted that this price rally triggered substantial profit-taking from long-term holders while also drawing in new buyers, leading to a sustained inflow of capital into the asset. The result is that bitcoin‚Äôs realized capitalization ‚Äî a measure of the total value of coins based on the last time they were moved ‚Äî has now surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. Unlike market capitalization, which reflects current price multiplied by total supply, realized cap tracks the actual liquidity deployed into bitcoin over time. This milestone reflects growing conviction among both long-term holders and new entrants, and signals a deepening of the asset‚Äôs liquidity base. It also points to bitcoin‚Äôs growing role on the macroeconomic stage, with the ability to absorb and settle ever larger volumes of capital. Institutional activity has continued to dominate headlines. On Friday, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced in a press release ""the successful execution of one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto on behalf of a client."" Galaxy said that it had executed a more than $9 billion bitcoin transaction on behalf of a legacy investor from the early days of the network. The 80,000 BTC sale is one of the largest of its kind in crypto history and was reportedly part of the client‚Äôs estate planning. Meanwhile, on Friday, CNBC resurfaced a detail from Tesla‚Äôs second quarter of 2022 earnings filings, which disclosed that the company had converted approximately 75% of its bitcoin into fiat currency during that quarter. With bitcoin hovering around $118,000 on Friday morning, David Faber, a ""Squawk on the Street"" co-host, estimated that had Tesla held onto its full bitcoin holdings, the value of its BTC holdings would now exceed $5 billion ‚Äî four times higher than its reported valuation of $1.25 billion as of the most recent quarter. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session ending July 26 at 14:00 UTC, the digital asset rallied more than 3%, carving out a $3,300 trading range between $114,937 and $118,237. Support has remained firm in the $117,140‚Äì$117,330 zone, while resistance appears to be consolidating just below the $118,200 threshold. The final hour of trading saw modest gains of 0.07% as BTC climbed from $118,095 to $118,183, with tight-range consolidation suggesting continued buying interest just below psychological resistance.

All According to Plan The corporation is following its ‚Äú10-year plan,‚Äù with the policy aligning with the Directors‚Äô views that digital assets, including Bitcoin, provide a means to preserve value over time and serve as a hedge against inflation. The overall goal is to enhance its treasury in the short term while implementing its organic growth strategy, which will then enable the medium-to long-term plan of making strategic acquisitions when appropriate. Andrew Webley, the CEO, shared: ‚ÄúWe have a clear plan to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and today we document this so that our shareholders can share the exciting journey. We are focused on accelerating short-term growth by scaling our proven core services, while also exploring strategic acquisitions that could unlock compelling value.‚Äù The post Another Corporate Stack: The Smarter Web Company Adds $26M BTC to Treasury appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/another-corporate-stack-the-smarter-web-company-adds-26m-btc-to-treasury/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|TREASURY","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption",cryptocompare
