2025-07-26T12:58:53,"Did Galaxy Digital Just Sell Stolen Bitcoin? CryptoQuant CEO Raises Big Questions","The post Did Galaxy Digital Just Sell Stolen Bitcoin? CryptoQuant CEO Raises Big Questions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet $9 billion Bitcoin sale has now turned into a major controversy and it could be tied to one of the earliest crypto exchange hacks on record. This week, Galaxy Digital confirmed it sold 80,000 Bitcoin (worth over $9.4 billion) through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. But CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says these coins may not belong to a long-term investor at all. Instead, they could be linked to the 2011 MyBitcoin exchange hack – a breach that, until now, had faded into crypto history. From a Dormant Wallet to a $9 Billion Payout “The recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin,” Ju posted on X. These wallets had been inactive since April 2011, two months before MyBitcoin went offline following a hack. At the time, the exchange’s owner, Tom Williams, admitted the breach and said he was working on a resolution. The attack reportedly caused $72,000 in losses – a small figure by today’s standards, but if those coins were kept, they’re now worth billions. Ju believes the Bitcoins either belong to the hacker or to Williams himself, who disappeared from the public eye after the exchange collapsed. Did Galaxy Check Where the BTC Came From? Here’s where things get murky. Ju added, “It seems Galaxy Digital bought (handled) the #Bitcoin from them, but I’m not sure if they did any forensics.” Galaxy didn’t reveal the seller’s identity. Instead, the company described them as a “Satoshi-era investor”, someone from Bitcoin’s early days, and said the sale was part of estate planning. That explanation hasn’t convinced everyone. The lack of transparency is now raising concerns over whether Galaxy skipped proper checks before handling a historic pile of possibly hacked funds. *Galaxy handled the 80K BTC sale for them. pic.twitter.com/QE4hDbHUXt — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 26, 2025 Also Read: Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Despite the Drama What’s surprising is how calm the market stayed. Despite such a large sale, Bitcoin barely moved, trading now around $117,983 . Since the deal was done OTC, it didn’t directly affect order books or exchanges. Still, it raises a bigger question: if stolen coins can quietly re-enter the system, how secure is the broader market really? A Sign of How the Bitcoin Market Is Changing There’s a larger shift happening too. Ju, who once used whale activity to predict Bitcoin cycles , now says that approach no longer works. Old whales aren’t selling to retail anymore – they’re passing coins to new long-term holders. This shift could explain how 14-year-old coins tied to a failed exchange can move billions without shaking the system. It’s a reminder that the crypto world is maturing but it’s still full of stories that haven’t been fully told.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-galaxy-digital-just-sell-stolen-bitcoin-cryptoquant-ceo-raises-big-questions/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-26T12:47:42,"Cambodia rounds up 3,000 suspects in human trafficking, cybercrime ring","Cambodia has arrested more than 3,000 individuals in connection with a vast cybercrime network. According to the details of the arrest, there were about 105 Indians and 81 Pakistanis. The international crackdown uncovered a vast trafficking and online fraud syndicate, with several victims being freed by authorities. According to the report, the arrest in Cambodia prompted Indian authorities to launch an investigation, led by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), into the cross-border digital crime network. In the documents released by ED, several fraud cases that have been tackled in the country have origins in scam centers throughout Southeast Asia , with Cambodia and Laos fingered as potential locations. These activities are always linked to the Golden Triangle, a notorious hub for illegal trafficking. Cambodia arrests individuals linked to a cybercrime network Investigations have revealed that numerous Indian citizens have been victims of this trafficking, with the perpetrators enticing them with the prospect of securing high-paying jobs for them abroad, especially in Singapore and Dubai. At the end of the day, most of them are trafficked to the locations where the groups carry out their digital scam . One victim, Manish Tomar from Uttar Pradesh, alleged that he was lured by Instagram influencer Bobby Kataria with a job offer in Singapore. Tomar said he ended up in Laos, and his passport was confiscated by Chinese nationals. He added that he was then taken to the Golden Triangle, where he was forced to take part in several investment scams and impersonation frauds. “He described a compound of 20–30 buildings guarded by armed private security, with translators to mediate between Chinese bosses and trafficked workers from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh,” the ED said in their note. Another victim, known as Paul, said he thought he was heading to Dubai for a job interview but found himself in a “digital arrest scam” center in Poim Phet in Cambodia. “There were guards trained in Muay Thai, armed with rifles. I was trained for seven days to impersonate a CBI officer. My job was to threaten victims in India, claiming they were involved in illegal activity,” Paul said. Paul admitted to scamming a person in Maharashtra of Rs. 75,000 ($900). In his detailed account, Paul mentioned that the scam centers operated in different units, but they were structured. “Line 1” would pretend to be from TRAI, while “Line 2” would impersonate police officers. “Line 3” acted as DCP-rank officers, offering fake help to their victims. Paul said he worked in Line 2, impersonating a police officer on WhatsApp video calls. The uniformed individual would lip-sync while he delivered the threats in multiple Indian languages. Furthermore, Paul said the syndicate used iPhones instead of computers to avoid IP tracking, and VOIP calls were routed through an app called Brian, with lines purchased from Thailand. He said the group specifically trained Pakistani nationals to impersonate Indian law enforcement, making it harder for Indian agencies to trace the fraud. Meanwhile, the ED said it is investigating a fraud network worth at least Rs. 159 crore (approximately $19.5 million). While most of the funds have been moved abroad via digital assets, the agency has been able to seize Rs. 3 crore ($360,000) from several Indian bank accounts. The ED also said it has secured the arrest of eight individuals for aiding in the creation of shell companies and laundering crime proceeds. Indian officials say the operation is a “ pig-butchering ” scam model where victims are being manipulated through various social platforms to invest in several digital assets and stock markets. Several high-profile losses have been connected to the crackdown in Cambodia. A woman reported that she was scammed out of Rs. 7.59 crore ($900,000) after investing in a bogus app. Another man lost Rs. 9.00 crore ($1.09 million), while a doctor lost Rs. 5.93 crore ($711,000).

2025-07-26T12:45:29,"Ancient Bitcoin (BTC) Springing to Life, Signaling Potential Sell-Side Pressure: Crypto Analytics Firm","New data from the market intelligence firm Glassnode reveals that ancient Bitcoin ( BTC ) is awakening, suggesting that sell-side pressure may rock the crypto king. In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics platform notes that tens of thousands of tokens have sprung to life during the month of July, meaning that early investors could be looking to take profits. “[Thursday] saw another wave of ancient coins move on-chain, with 3,900 BTC aged over 10 years becoming active. This follows the 80,000 BTC that moved on July 4, 2025. Such activity from long-dormant supply often reflects internal reallocation, custodial shifts, or in some cases sell-side pressure.” Source: Glassnode/X According to Glassnode, the top crypto asset by market cap could still form a “bottom formation zone” if it fails to hold support. “The sharp rally from $110,000 to $117,000 created an on-chain air gap or a low-density accumulation zone. Since the $122,000 ATH (all-time high), price has held above it. If support fails, history shows such gaps can still evolve into bottom formation zones.” Source: Glassnode/X In its weekly on-chain analytics report, Glassnode details how BTC reaching a $1 trillion realized market cap is a monumental step for the flagship cryptocurrency. “Recent capital inflow has pushed Bitcoin’s realized cap above the $1 trillion mark for the first time. This is truly a monumental milestone for Bitcoin, highlighting its deep liquidity profile, and growing relevance on the macro stage. The larger Bitcoin becomes, the more capital can be stored within it, and the larger size can be settled via transactions.” Bitcoin’s realized market cap calculates the value of each coin at the price it was last transacted (on-chain), rather than the current market price. The metric aims to represent the “true” capital inflow into the BTC network. Bitcoin is trading for $116,671 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-26T12:44:23,"Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen Sells $200M XRP, Will He Sell More in the Coming Week?","The post Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen Sells $200M XRP, Will He Sell More in the Coming Week? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently trading near $3.16 with about $8 billion in market cap, despite a 14% drop over the past week. The token is showing resilience, sitting above key technical averages, but recent large token activity is drawing renewed scrutiny. Larsen Sells $200M XRP Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has offloaded over 100 million XRP tokens, worth around $200 million, during the recent price dip , adding pressure to the already shaky market. XRP fell by nearly 20%, touching $3.18 as of July 23. While some see this as a routine move, analysts warn that such large-scale selling, especially during market pullbacks, can worsen price drops. Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that’s $8.83B. If $200M was just the warm-up… what’s next? Don’t get dumped on. Don’t be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself. https://t.co/k152FXlm8N pic.twitter.com/T5CpTQjdDa — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 25, 2025 Larsen still holds a massive 2.58 billion XRP (about $7.9 billion), and experts like CryptoQuant’s J.A. Maartun believe more sales could be coming. This has raised concerns about how much influence major holders like Larsen have on XRP’s price action . Analysts tracked about $140 million of that going through centralized platforms, often a signal of forthcoming sales. XRP fell from its $3.66 high to below $3.16 in the same week. What Makes This Sell-Off Different? This isn’t Larsen’s first liquidation spree; he’s sold over 107 million XRP (valued at about $3.3 billion) since November. His fellow co-founder, Jed McCaleb, completed his orderly exit in 2022, but Larsen’s continued activity keeps pressure on market sentiment. Some observers see this pattern as strategic profit-taking built into the token’s early structure. Major seller activity near all-time highs, but not coordinated dumping, is historically normal for founder-held coins. Still, the scale raises concerns around micro-market influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Explains Why Hidden Road Is Key to DeFi Growth , XRP Price Crash Ahead? While critics cite the founder’s selling as a trigger for recent weakness, others point to broader market trends driving the pullback. Legal expert Bill Morgan dismissed the idea that one person is tanking the market, citing macro forces and regulatory anxiety instead. Even after large withdrawals, technical indicators show support near $2.25 to $3.00, and XRP is consolidating around $3.10-$3.16, a balance point where both bulls and bears are active. Bitcoin dominance has slipped to around 59–61%, a sign that money is rotating into tokens like XRP, SOL, and Dogecoin, which have recovered strong gains. Technical setups show room to move upward from current support levels, with a break above $3.66 potentially triggering renewed buying up toward resistance near $3.81. Institutional demand remains steady, with open interest in XRP futures climbing steadily. Will Chris Larsen Sell More XRP in the Coming Days? With founder sales still possible, investors are watching how markets absorb liquidity. If XRP can reclaim $3.31 and bounce off support, traders may view recent declines as short-term noise. If not, deeper correction toward $2.25 or below could follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-26T12:35:09,"Why Everyone’s Unstaking Ethereum? Cathie Wood Explains the Surge","The post Why Everyone’s Unstaking Ethereum? Cathie Wood Explains the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is making headlines again, not just for its price movement, but for a sudden spike in unstaking activity. According to Ark Invest’s Chief Futurist Brett Winton , the latest “Queue Wait Time” chart shows a sharp increase in users trying to withdraw their staked ETH. So, what’s causing this surge? Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes there are two key drivers behind this trend: Robinhood’s 2% crypto match offer and a shift of staked Ethereum into Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. Let’s break it down. Robinhood’s New Crypto Offer: 2% Match Boosts Activity In a recent post on X, Cathie Wood pointed to Robinhood’s latest move as a major reason behind the unstaking activity. The platform is now offering a 2% bonus for users who transfer their crypto, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, to Robinhood wallets. This incentive is designed to attract crypto holders and bring more digital assets under Robinhood’s control. As a result, many users are unstaking their ETH to take advantage of the offer. The Rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) Beyond short-term offers, Cathie Wood highlights a more strategic trend: institutional investors and VCs are moving staked ETH into Digital Asset Treasury firms. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 , These companies, similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR), hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, for example, owns over 607,770 BTC worth $71.35 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The combined BTC holdings of all public companies stand at 897,086 BTC, valued at more than $105 billion. According to Wood, investors believe that by transferring ETH into DATs, they can potentially double their money, gaining exposure to crypto and benefiting from the rising stock prices of these firms. Why This Strategy Appeals to Traditional Financial Advisors For many financial advisors, direct crypto exposure is still limited by regulations. But buying stock in Treasury firms like MicroStrategy allows them to offer indirect crypto exposure to their clients. This is a key reason why more institutional players are opting for DATs. They see it as a smarter way to manage crypto within the bounds of traditional finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-26T12:27:49,"Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025","The post Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Yet another crazy week in crypto with moments that caught everyone off guard. From massive bitcoin buys to major scams, upgrades, and unexpected exits, the stories came from every corner – exchanges, regulators, and even celebrities! If you’ve missed anything, don’t worry. Here’s a complete crypto roundup for you to get caught up on it all. Let’s dive in. #1 Trump Media Buys $2B in Bitcoin to Build Crypto Reserve Trump Media has officially joined the crypto treasury club. The company behind Truth Social confirmed a $2 billion investment in bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets. CEO Devin Nunes says the move is part of a long-term strategy to “help ensure our Company’s financial freedom” and support a future utility token for the platform. Another $300 million has been set aside for options tied to Bitcoin. The company also plans to explore crypto ETFs . #2 Ozzy Osbourne’s Death Triggers Scam Token Rush on Solana Just hours after Ozzy Osbourne passed away, Solana saw a flood of new memecoins using his name. At least 15 “OZZY” or “RIP Ozzy” tokens were launched – many of them scams. On-chain data shows 10 were confirmed rug pulls, draining around 1,625 SOL, or over $325,000, from investors. In most cases, liquidity was pulled within minutes. The trend mirrors other high-profile crypto scams tied to real-world events. As one report claims , “up to 98% of tokens on Pump.fun” are pump-and-dump schemes, though the platform strongly denies it. #3 New ‘Stretch’ Stock Gives Michael Saylor More Room to Buy BTC Michael Saylor isn’t slowing down! Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has raised $2.8 billion through its new “Stretch” preferred stock offering, up from the original $500 million plan. The money will go straight into more Bitcoin, part of the company’s long-term “42/42” goal to raise $84 billion by 2027. This new stock comes with a flexible 9% monthly dividend, giving Strategy more control as crypto markets shift. With over 607,000 BTC already on its books, the company is doubling down even as critics warn that its debt-heavy strategy could carry major risk. #4 FTX Will Start Next Payout to Creditors on Sept. 30 FTX will begin its next round of creditor repayments on September 30, the bankrupt exchange said on Wednesday. The funds will be distributed through BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. So far, FTX has already returned $6.2 billion after getting court approval for its repayment plan. The company also got permission to reduce its disputed claim reserve from $6.5B to $4.3B. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud, but for creditors, the slow road to recovery continues. #5 Ripple CEO Warns of New YouTube Scam Ripple is once again warning its community as YouTube scams targeting XRP holders are on the rise. CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X this week, urging users to watch out for fake Ripple channels offering high-return airdrops. Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks on the crypto community — PLEASE BEWARE of the latest scam targeting the XRP family on @YouTube and impersonating @Ripple ’s official account! We will keep reporting these – please do the same. As… https://t.co/WodO4ZUyW9 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 23, 2025 The warning comes just days after XRP’s price dropped 10% from its recent high – a moment scammers appear to be using to their advantage. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also flagged a deepfake video promoting a fake 100M XRP giveaway. Investors are advised to avoid unknown links and double-check official accounts. #6 Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. Lists on Nasdaq Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. is now a public company. The firm joined the Nasdaq this week, not through a standard IPO, but by merging with SRM Entertainment – a U.S. toy maker that supplies Disney and Universal. Sun called the listing “a very big moment for the whole industry.” Tron Inc. now holds over $115 million worth of TRX tokens, and trading volume surged 36% after the news. #7 FBI Closes Case Against Kraken’s Jesse Powell Jesse Powell, co-founder of Kraken, is officially in the clear. The FBI has dropped its investigation into him, confirming no criminal charges will be filed. A declination letter from the Department of Justice also states that all seized laptops, phones, and crypto have been returned. The case was tied to a nonprofit dispute, not to Kraken or crypto. This clears the path for Powell to focus fully on Kraken again and it sends a strong signal that facts still matter in high-profile investigations. #8 Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade May Arrive in November Ethereum developers are targeting a November launch for the Fusaka hard fork ,, which includes 11 proposals focused on security and scalability. One key update, EIP-7825, aims to make the network stronger against attacks. A devnet rolled out this week, with two public testnets to follow. “We need our timeline TIGHT,” warned protocol support member Nixo. To speed things up, EIP-7907 has been dropped, and the EVM Object Format won’t be included. Fusaka could ship just before Devconnect, while work on the next upgrade , Glamsterdam, is already underway. #9 CoinDCX Hit by $44M Hack, Customer Funds Safe CoinDCX , India’s largest crypto exchange, confirmed it lost $44 million after one of its internal accounts was compromised. The account was used for liquidity on a partner exchange and had no connection to user wallets. CEO Sumit Gupta said the breach was contained quickly and the loss will be covered by CoinDCX’s own reserves. The stolen crypto – 4,443 ETH and 155,830 SOL – was moved using Solana-Ethereum bridges and now sits dormant. Investigations are ongoing. A 25% recovery bounty has been announced for anyone who helps trace the funds. #10 80,000 Vintage Bitcoins Sold by Galaxy Digital On Friday evening, Galaxy Digital confirmed it sold over 80,000 bitcoins, worth more than $9 billion, for a Satoshi-era investor. These vintage coins, created in 2011, had been pooled and quietly transferred before the sale. “The transaction was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy,” Galaxy said. What’s surprising is how the market reacted: it didn’t. Despite the size of the sale, prices held steady. With similar moves expected, like the UK’s 61,245 BTC sale, this could signal a new phase of market maturity. Bitcoin is headed up! In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! First U.S.-Regulated Stablecoin Launches Under GENIUS Act: Ethena and Anchorage rolled out USDtb with full federal oversight , backed by cash and Treasuries. It’s the first onshore stablecoin under the new law and ENA jumped 5% on launch. Citadel Pushes Back on Tokenization Loopholes: The firm warned the SEC that exempting major players from standard rules could distort equity markets and hurt investor protections, calling instead for formal rulemaking to prevent unfair regulatory advantages. SEC Hits Pause on Bitwise ETF After Green Light: Just hours after approving the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund conversion, the SEC moved to halt progress for a formal review, which was what it did against Grayscale’s GDLC and drew fresh legal heat. Pudgy Penguins CEO Eyes NFTs 2.0 and a Gaming Breakout: Luca Netz says crypto’s next big wave will come from gaming, not just NFTs. With $50M in projected revenue and toys as brand touchpoints , Igloo Inc. is betting big on long-term consumer IP. Goldman, BNY Bring Tokenized Funds to Wall Street: Backed by Treasuries and supported by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, the funds offer yield with real-time settlement, pushing blockchain infrastructure deeper into capital markets right as new stablecoin laws kick in. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Bitcoin’s role as a corporate reserve is back in focus. With Trump Media and Strategy pouring billions into BTC, treasury strategies are evolving fast. Expect more firms to follow. Stablecoins are entering a new phase – fully regulated! The launch of USDtb shows what compliance-driven stablecoins could look like. Ethereum’s next upgrade is moving fast. Fusaka is on track for a November release with key changes focused on security. Celebrity-linked scams are becoming a bigger threat. The Ozzy token rush highlights how quickly scammers exploit real-world events. This kind of memecoin trend could put more pressure on platforms to respond faster. Large BTC sales no longer shock the market. Galaxy sold $9B in vintage bitcoin without shaking prices. With more big holders expected to sell this year, the market seems better prepared than before. That’s it for now – until the next twist, the next shift, the next headline.

2025-07-26T12:25:43,"Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","The post Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of Hedera crypto is $ 0.27461526 . Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.27461526 10.26% Market Cap. $ 11,641,674,022.3088 Trading Volume. $ 931,691,598.4211 Circulating Supply. 42,392,669,987.5333 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to July 18th, where HBAR spiked 135% to $0.30, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. But, the crypto sector saw short-term profit booking, not even HBAR was spared by the bears. But this profit booking seems healthy, as it has not broken the 20-day EMA’s dynamic support, indicating the strength is intact in the overall trend and marking it as a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength, then in the rest of July, it may aim for $0.30 level’s retest again and flipping it with a daily close could potentially open doors next month for a retest of the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

2025-07-26T12:15:15,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Price Slumps As Galaxy Digital Completes One Of The Largest BTC Transactions In History","Bitcoin (BTC) continued declining during the ongoing session, extending its losses for a fourth day as selling pressure thanks to Galaxy Digital’s mammoth Bitcoin transaction pushed prices lower. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $114,770 on Friday as bearish sentiment peaked. However, it rebounded to reclaim $117,000, and currently trades around $117,307. Satoshi-Era Investor Cashes Out Via Galaxy Digital An early Bitcoin (BTC) investor has cashed out 80,000 BTC worth $9 billion at current prices through Galaxy Digital, completing what is being described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history. However, the details regarding the transaction have not been disclosed. The sale disclosure appeared in an announcement late on Friday, followed by a post on Galaxy Digital’s official blog. Galaxy Digital has not revealed the client’s identity, but stated that it was “part of the investor’s broader real estate planning strategy.” The announcement came after a day of heightened volatility for Bitcoin , with the asset’s price briefly dropping below $115,000 on Friday. Lookonchain data revealed several large transactions from Galaxy Digital throughout Friday, with most of the funds sent directly to exchanges. All the transactions were tied to the investor who moved over 80,000 BTC from a wallet that was dormant for 14 years. BTC rebounded after Friday’s drop below $115,000, with analysts noting that the market has already absorbed the entire sale. Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya, stated, “80,000 BTC , over $9 billion, was sold into open market order books, and bitcoin barely moved.” Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $135,000 By Year-End Citigroup has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $135,000 by the end of the year in its best-case scenario. According to Citigroup analysts, strong demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable macroeconomic trends, and growing user adoption could fuel the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally. Bitcoin is trading between $115,000 and $120,000 over the past week, showing resilience despite mixed economic data. The prediction has sparked optimism among investors and highlights Wall Street’s growing confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from Friday’s low as it reclaimed $117,000 and moved to $117,565. Despite the recovery, it remains in the red during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered over the past 24 hours, up nearly 2%. Analysts believe the price will pull back towards the $115,000 mark if current market trends continue, marking a 6% decline from recent all-time highs. However, they pointed out that the correction remains well within the normal volatility range observed in previous bull phases. This indicates the decline is part of a healthy market reset rather than a deeper correction. BTC registered a sharp drop last Tuesday (July 15), dropping to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. It recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 1% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641.

Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $119,101. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.03% to $117,877.

2025-07-26T12:08:57,"AI sets date when Bitcoin will crash below $100,000","An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has suggested that, despite Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current bullish run, there is a plausible chance the asset could crash below $100,000 in the coming weeks. According to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Bitcoin, currently around $117,000, is hovering near critical support at $116,000. A breakdown below this level could send it to $105,000 and $108,000, with sub-$100,000 levels possible by August or early September 2025 if support fails. The AI model highlighted key risks that could accelerate a Bitcoin sell-off, including a slowdown in spot ETF inflows and a broader U.S. market correction. Notably, Bitcoin ETF inflows have been a key factor in the asset’s momentum, contributing to the record high of over $123,000. At the close of trading on June 25, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an inflow of $130.8 million. At the same time, as reported by Finbold, Citi analysts predict a base case of $135,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2025 if inflows persist; however, the bank also warned that the asset could crash to as low as $64,000. ChatGPT also noted that both scenarios could put additional pressure on Bitcoin prices, especially as the cryptocurrency’s correlation with the S&P 500 has increased in recent months. Further downside could also stem from unpredictable events such as exchange hacks or sudden regulatory crackdowns, which have historically triggered panic sell-offs. The AI model emphasized that, although the exact timing remains uncertain, investors should be aware of a 30% to 40% probability that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000 between August and September 2025. Probability of Bitcoin crashing below $100,000. Source: ChatGPT Bitcoin’s key price level to watch Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe also highlighted the significance of Bitcoin holding above $116,000. In an X post on July 26, Poppe stated that the $116,800 level is the key battleground for bulls. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to his analysis, maintaining support above this threshold could set the stage for a push toward new all-time highs in the coming week. Notably, there is strong liquidity below the $116,000 level, which has been tested multiple times, suggesting buyers are actively defending the zone. Therefore, if Bitcoin can establish a stable base above $116,800, the market may target the $119,900 resistance zone. However, if BTC dips, the $110,000 to $112,000 range is highlighted as a prime accumulation zone, offering a potentially strong risk-reward opportunity for long-term investors.

While Trump stated that he was in favor of a strong dollar, saying, “I would never support a weak dollar,” he also talked about the economic advantages that a low exchange rate provides to the US manufacturing industry. “I would never say I like low exchange rates. I'm someone who likes a strong dollar. But a weak dollar can make you more money,” Trump said. These statements came at a time when markets were speculating that he was actively supporting his administration's weak dollar policy. Related News: Analytics Firm Issues Warning: Unusual Data Coming in Bitcoin Options - Here's What It Signals Asked if he was concerned about the US dollar's continued decline, Trump replied, “I like a strong dollar,” then quickly added, “But I don't lose sleep over it.” The president also specifically noted that the manufacturing sector benefits from a weak dollar. Trump said, “A strong dollar has its consequences. It looks good from the outside, but no one comes to travel. You can't sell factories, trucks, or anything. A strong dollar is only good for controlling inflation, that's all. We don't have inflation anyway; we've completely eliminated it.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-26T12:00:51,"Senator Warren Slams Crypto ‘Industry-Designed’ Bills, Says American People Will ‘Pay The Price’","US Senator Elizabeth Warren has slammed the Trump administration and the recently passed crypto bill focusing on stablecoin regulation, arguing that the American people will pay the price for “industry-designed” legislation. US Lawmakers Must Get Legislation Right In a Vanity Fair interview , Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump a week ago during the House of Representatives’ “Crypto Week.” Introduced in February by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, the GENIUS Act establishes a framework that will allow stablecoins to fall under the Federal Reserve Rules, creating a “safe and pro-growth” regulatory structure to advance the US digital assets industry. When asked about the number of Democrats who supported the bill , Warren explained that “there’s been a long, bipartisan tradition of helping out industry instead of doing what the American people have called for: unrigging the economy and making life more affordable.” The crypto-skeptic senator affirmed that she agrees that strong digital assets legislation is needed, but that pushing what she deems “industry-designed” bills is a mistake. “If we’re going to ratify a sweeping crypto regulatory framework, we need to get it right,” she argued. According to the senator, the industry’s “influence” in Washington was expected, as it is a city where “money talks.” As reported by Bitcoinist, Super Political Action Committees (PACs) have spent hundreds of millions over the past few years. A recent report revealed that Fairshake, the largest Super PAC, and its affiliates invested around $136 million in supporting nearly 60 pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle, and “are well-prepared for the 2026 midterms, boasting over $100 million in resources.” Warren asserted that the sectors’ spending on lobbying has “blown through anything that Washington has seen before,” which resulted in the digital assets industry writing “its own legislation.” Warren compared the GENIUS Act to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, affirming that when Washington works for industries, only a handful of people get rich, while the American people “pay the price.” We’ve seen that movie before, when the industry writes its own legislation. (…) When the derivatives industry (…) came to Washington and said, ‘Here’s a bill, please regulate us,’ and handed the legislators a bill that weakly regulated the industry and gave it the appearance of the US government’s backing. The consequence was the crash of 2008 that cost 10 million American families their homes and more their jobs and their savings. Sen. Warren Slams Trump’s Crypto Pivot Warren also reaffirmed her stance on the Trump administration’s shift to pro-industry legislation to allegedly benefit himself. To the Democratic senator, the US President is “using the presidency to enrich himself through crypto, and he’s doing it in plain sight.” Previously, she raised concerns about President Trump’s crypto ventures, arguing that they could pave the way for potential “crypto corruption.” In May, the lawmaker urged Congress to reject the GENIUS Act despite bipartisan efforts to amend the legislation to address the concerns of Senate Democrats. During the interview, Warren also criticized the US President for appointing industry insiders to “run crypto policy,” disbanding the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) enforcement unit, and asking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pivot from its “regulation by enforcement” approach from the previous administration. “People who voted for Trump sent him to the White House because he promised lower costs on day one—not to turn the White House into a crypto cash machine,” she concluded. Despite the senator’s concerns, some industry players consider that the regulatory shift and the GENIUS Act will be positive for the American digital assets industry. MARA Holdings CEO, Fred Thiel, recently stated that the recently passed legislation shows the US is taking a leadership position globally, and it will be “very helpful for providing trust” to the sector while allowing the market to “move much freer.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/senator-warren-slams-crypto-industry-designed-bills-says-american-people-will-pay-the-price/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto industry|Crypto legislation|Crypto Market|Elizabeth Warren|GENIUS Act|President Donald Trump|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|Super PACs|US Senator Warren",cryptocompare
2025-07-26T12:00:31,"Wall Street’s Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says","Bitcoin has jumped more than 170% from its launch‑month price around $45,000 to about $123,000 earlier this month. Related Reading: Crypto’s Golden Rule Just Got Broken, According To Analyst Based on reports from Citi, the bank has laid out three scenarios for where the price might land by year‑end 2025. These range from a low of $64,000 in a weak market to a bull case of $199,000 if everything goes right. ETF Flows Take Center Stage In Bitcoin Uptrend According to Citi analysts, spot Bitcoin ETFs now explain over 40% of the recent price swings. Since their debut, US ETFs have snapped up about $54.66 billion worth of Bitcoin. That buying power helped drive BTC from roughly $45,000 to $123,000 in just a few months. The bank’s base case assumes another $15 billion in ETF inflows this year. At the ratio they’ve modeled—about $4 of price per $1 of flow—that would add around $63,000 to Bitcoin’s value. 🚨 Bitcoin Could Surge to $199K by Year-End, Says Citi Citigroup has released a new forecast projecting Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by the end of 2025 in its base-case scenario. The bullish case estimates a potential rise to $199,000, while the bearish outlook places the… pic.twitter.com/3Kp1o8OGsn — The Tradesman (@The_Tradesman1) July 26, 2025 User Growth Fuels Network Effects Based on figures from trading desks and on‑chain metrics, Citi expects a 20% rise in active Bitcoin users over the next year. That jump in adoption would support roughly $75,000 of price strength on its own. The idea is simple. More users mean more hands holding and trading Bitcoin. That activity tends to make prices less prone to sudden drops. Still, forecasts like this rest on the assumption that new users stick around rather than flipping coins for quick gains. Macroeconomic Factors Cut Forecast Slightly Citi’s model also factors in weaker performance in equities and gold, trimming the price by about $3,200. That adjustment reflects a view that if stock and metal markets struggle, Bitcoin won’t fully decouple from broader risk assets. At the same time, growing regulatory approval and deeper links between crypto and traditional finance should offer some support. ETF Demand Could Lift Bitcoin By $63,000 In the base‑case scenario, Citi adds the $63,000 from ETF flows to the $75,000 from user growth, then subtracts $3,200 for macro headwinds. That math lands the price at about $135,000 in 2025. That figure is only $12,000 above the recent peak of $123,000. It suggests Citi sees more upside but not a runaway rally—at least not in the base case.

Conversely, a drop to $64,000 is possible if macro conditions sour sharply. Globally, ETFs now hold around 1.48 million BTC, worth over $170 billion—about 7% of the total supply. That level of institutional backing is unprecedented. It shifts Bitcoin’s fate more toward big‑money flows than pure retail hype.
