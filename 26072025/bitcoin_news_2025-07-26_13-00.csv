2025-07-26T10:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Soars: An Unprecedented Triumph Above $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars: An Unprecedented Triumph Above $118,000 Imagine waking up to news that Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has achieved an astonishing milestone. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has reportedly risen above the monumental mark of $118,000, trading specifically at $118,006.77 on the Binance USDT market. This reported Bitcoin price surge marks an unprecedented moment in the digital asset’s journey, captivating investors and enthusiasts worldwide. What does this historic achievement signify for the future of finance, and what factors could possibly propel Bitcoin to such stratospheric heights? Let’s delve into the details of this extraordinary development and its far-reaching implications. What’s Behind the Monumental Bitcoin Price Surge? When we witness such an astonishing leap in Bitcoin price , it’s natural to wonder about the underlying forces at play. A rally of this magnitude is rarely the result of a single factor; instead, it’s often a confluence of macroeconomic trends, technological advancements, and shifting investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone trying to navigate the volatile yet exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Several key elements typically contribute to significant upward movements in Bitcoin’s value: Institutional Adoption: A major catalyst for any substantial Bitcoin price increase is the growing interest and investment from large financial institutions. When major corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds begin allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it signals a powerful vote of confidence. This influx of capital not only boosts demand but also lends legitimacy to the asset class, attracting more mainstream investors. Halving Events: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, and its new supply is periodically cut in half through ‘halving’ events. These events reduce the reward miners receive for validating transactions, thereby slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. Historically, halving events have preceded significant price rallies due to the basic economic principle of reduced supply meeting constant or increasing demand. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic conditions often play a significant role. In times of inflation or economic uncertainty, traditional safe-haven assets like gold might see increased demand. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ by many, offering a decentralized alternative that is not subject to the monetary policies of any single government. This perception can drive significant investment, pushing the Bitcoin price upwards. Technological Advancements and Network Upgrades: Continuous development within the Bitcoin network, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., the Lightning Network) or enhanced security features, can increase its utility and appeal. A more robust and efficient network attracts more users and applications, reinforcing its value proposition. Increased Retail Participation: While institutional money provides large capital injections, widespread retail interest fuels momentum. Easier access to cryptocurrency exchanges, improved user interfaces, and increased public awareness can lead to a surge in individual investors buying Bitcoin, contributing to its upward trajectory. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? The question on every investor’s mind following such an impressive surge in Bitcoin price is whether this momentum can be sustained. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with sharp corrections often following rapid gains. Evaluating sustainability requires a closer look at market fundamentals, investor behavior, and potential headwinds. Sustainability in the crypto market is complex. While the factors driving the current surge are powerful, potential challenges always exist: Market Corrections: No asset moves in a straight line forever. Profit-taking by early investors and large holders (whales) can lead to significant pullbacks. These corrections are a natural part of market cycles, helping to ‘reset’ valuations and absorb excess exuberance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are increasingly turning their attention to regulating the cryptocurrency space. While clear regulations can bring stability and legitimacy, overly restrictive or uncertain regulatory environments can dampen investor enthusiasm and impact the Bitcoin price . Global Economic Headwinds: Unexpected economic downturns, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, potentially causing outflows from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Competition from Altcoins: While Bitcoin is dominant, the emergence of innovative altcoins with unique functionalities could, in the long term, divert some investment flows. However, Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and network effect remain incredibly strong. Despite these potential challenges, the underlying trend towards digital transformation and decentralized finance suggests a strong long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The current rally, if driven by genuine adoption and utility, could signal a new phase of maturation for the asset. How Does This Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s status as the market leader means that its movements have a profound ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the Bitcoin price experiences such a dramatic rise, it often acts as a tide that lifts all boats, influencing altcoins and the overall market capitalization. Here’s how a significant Bitcoin surge impacts the broader market: Altcoin Rallies: Often, after Bitcoin makes a significant move, investors look for opportunities in altcoins. This phenomenon, sometimes called ‘altcoin season,’ occurs as profits from Bitcoin are rotated into other digital assets, driving up their prices. Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and countless other cryptocurrencies often see correlated gains. Increased Market Capitalization: A rising Bitcoin price directly contributes to the overall market capitalization of the crypto space. This increased market cap often attracts more institutional and retail interest, as the perceived size and stability of the market grow. Investor Sentiment: Positive sentiment around Bitcoin tends to spill over into the rest of the market. A soaring Bitcoin can create a sense of optimism and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), encouraging new investors to enter the market and existing ones to increase their holdings across various digital assets. Innovation and Development: A bull market, often led by Bitcoin, can provide significant funding and motivation for new projects and technological innovations within the blockchain space. Developers and entrepreneurs are more likely to build and launch new decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols when market conditions are favorable. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Price: Opportunities and Risks For investors and enthusiasts, a significant surge in Bitcoin price presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding how to navigate this dynamic environment is key to making informed decisions and potentially capitalizing on future movements. Opportunities: Wealth Creation: For those who invested early or held through previous cycles, a rally to $118,000 would represent substantial wealth creation. It reinforces Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and an appreciating asset. Increased Mainstream Acceptance: Higher prices and increased visibility often lead to greater acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method, an investment vehicle, and a legitimate financial asset by businesses and governments. Diversification: Bitcoin can serve as a diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio, potentially offering returns that are uncorrelated with traditional asset classes, though this correlation can shift. Risks and Actionable Insights: High Volatility: Even at higher valuations, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. Investors should be prepared for significant drawdowns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Sudden policy changes in major economies could impact the Bitcoin price . Security Risks: While Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure, individual investors must take responsibility for securing their holdings from hacks, scams, and phishing attempts. Actionable Insights for Investors: If you’re considering engaging with Bitcoin, especially after such a significant price movement, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, its market dynamics, and your own risk tolerance. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is powerful, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies if you choose to. Secure Your Assets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up-to-date with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. The reported surge of Bitcoin above $118,000 is a testament to the digital asset’s enduring appeal and growing significance in the global financial landscape. While such a rapid ascent brings exhilarating opportunities, it also underscores the importance of a cautious and informed approach. Bitcoin’s journey is far from over, and its future trajectory will undoubtedly continue to be one of the most compelling narratives in the world of finance. This monumental achievement, if sustained, could reshape perceptions of digital currency, paving the way for broader adoption and integration into everyday financial systems. As Bitcoin continues to defy expectations, it remains a powerful symbol of innovation and the potential for a decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for Bitcoin to rise above $118,000? A: A rise above $118,000 signifies a massive increase in Bitcoin’s market value, pushing it to an unprecedented all-time high. This indicates extremely strong demand, significant investor confidence, and potentially a major shift in how the market perceives Bitcoin’s long-term value and utility. Q2: What factors typically drive such a significant Bitcoin price increase? A: Major drivers often include increased institutional adoption (large funds buying Bitcoin), macroeconomic factors (like inflation hedging), Bitcoin halving events (reducing new supply), technological advancements within the network, and growing retail investor interest. These factors combine to create strong buying pressure. Q3: Is a Bitcoin price of $118,000 sustainable in the long term? A: While the crypto market is inherently volatile, a price point like $118,000, if achieved and sustained, would suggest a strong underlying fundamental shift in demand and acceptance. Sustainability depends on continued institutional interest, favorable regulatory environments, and Bitcoin’s continued role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. However, market corrections are always possible. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price surge affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin’s movements often dictate the broader crypto market’s sentiment. A significant Bitcoin price surge typically leads to a positive ripple effect, with altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) often experiencing their own rallies as investors rotate profits or seek new opportunities. This can increase the overall market capitalization of the crypto ecosystem. Q5: What should investors do during a rapid Bitcoin price rally? A: During a rapid rally, it’s crucial to remain calm and avoid impulsive decisions. Investors should prioritize doing their own research, consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility, diversify their portfolios, and ensure their assets are securely stored. Avoid investing more than you can afford to lose, as volatility remains a key characteristic of the crypto market. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-07-26T10:53:25,"Ripple vs SEC or XRP Holders? Ex-SEC Answers Buzzing Question As Case Awaits Final Whistle","Recent developments have triggered unease among XRP holders, not because of any court ruling or regulatory announcement, but due to concerns about Ripple’s political affiliations. Questions about whether Ripple’s actions serve the interests of XRP holders are now gaining traction, as political donations by Ripple’s leadership come under public scrutiny once again. Community Reactions to Ripple’s Political Support Some community members recently drew attention to donations made by Ripple executives to Kamala Harris’ campaign during the 2024 presidential race. Chris Larsen contributed over $11 million to the campaign , making him the top donor from the crypto industry. This news provoked frustrations among community members at the time, and those tensions have reemerged. Donald Trump has consistently shown support for cryptocurrencies, promising to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. He accepted crypto donations during his campaign and actively engaged with crypto holders. Larsen’s decision to support Harris did not sit well with many community members who saw Trump as the better candidate for the crypto industry. Some now re-evaluate their long-term support for Ripple, viewing the donations as a sign that the company may not represent their values or financial interests. One crypto user recently highlighted these frustrations, suggesting that XRP holders should dump their tokens if XRP reaches $3.5 again and buy Bitcoin if it crosses $125,000. Former SEC Lawyer Weighs In He also drew attention to the XRP lawsuit, arguing that Joe Biden’s administration held XRP down while Gary Gensler aggressively pursued the crypto market. He called Ripple two-faced for cozying up to Trump after the election despite the support its executives accorded Harris, who shared Biden’s views. Marc Fagel, a former SEC attorney, intervened to address the issue. He clarified that the enforcement action against Ripple was filed under the Trump administration, during Jay Clayton’s tenure as SEC Chair. Fagel explained that Gary Gensler, who took over as SEC Chair months later, had no role in initiating the case. Ripple was sued under the Trump/Clayton administration, long before Gensler was appointed. Basic facts, sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 24, 2025 Fagel previously noted that it was irrelevant that Clayton signed off on the lawsuit on his final day in office, as the investigation began long before then. Gensler only inherited the lawsuit, and the vote under Clayton to proceed aimed to avoid delays during the leadership transition. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite that, the Trump administration has dismissed most crypto-related lawsuits, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently revealed that the company is closing the chapter on the lawsuit , an outcome that may not have materialized under a Harris presidency, and this has reinforced the concern shared by many community members about the company’s support for Harris.

2025-07-26T10:41:26,"Nano Labs: Ambitious Binance Coin Bet Transforms Chip Maker Into Crypto Play","Summary NA is quickly shifting from being an ASIC designer to a crypto‑treasury vehicle. It now holds a sizeable amount of BTC and BNB. Note that NA’s Cuckoo 3.0 and FPU 3.0 chips deliver 83% better energy efficiency, yet hardware sales remained under $6 million in 2024. Web3 ambitions seemingly supersede NA’s previous chip strategic objectives. Management aims to own 5‑10% of the BNB supply and launch NBNB.io stablecoin. However, that requires billions beyond NA’s currently available resources. That implies aggressive financing, as evidenced by its recent $500 million notes. Still, there’s also upside potential for NA despite its risks. Hence, I lean towards a “Hold” as their bet on stablecoins, BTC, and BNB could pay off considerably. Nano Labs Ltd. ( NA ) is a hybrid technology-crypto company that develops ASIC hardware and blockchain infrastructure. NA also has a business segment that accumulates strategic digital assets (i.e., cryptocurrencies). They also developed high-throughput computing chips like the Cuckoo 3.0 and advanced architectures such as FPU 3.0. However, their recent push into the crypto space is noteworthy. Their formal adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, acquisition of over 120,000 BNB tokens ( BNB-USD ), and planned launch of a licensed stablecoin platform in Hong Kong shift NA into more of a “crypto” play at this point. Still, I feel the stock is a bit too risky to warrant a bullish rating, which is why I settle on a “Hold” at these levels. Crypto Tech Nano Labs is technically a fabless integrated circuit (IC) design firm that develops computing and application-specific chips, as well as software solutions for its hardware. They were founded back in 2019, with an IPO in 2022 , and they’re currently headquartered in Hangzhou, China. Additionally, the company defines its value proposition through accumulating digital asset reserves, mainly Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Source: Nano Labs Ltd. Website. Retrieved July 22, 2025. Today, NA’s portfolio includes a range of semiconductor products, such as high-throughput computing (HTC) chips, part of the Cuckoo series, high-performance computing (HPC) chips, vision processing chips, and smart network interface cards (NICs). It’s worth mentioning that their Cuckoo series Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) compete with traditional GPUs. Additionally, the company offers integrated software solutions like firmware, control programs, tools for monitoring performance, and blockchain-specific systems to operate and enhance the hardware. In total, these technology packages are intended for enterprise and individual customers. NA’s Enterprise clients are typically mining farms, cloud computing providers, or AI infrastructure operators. Whereas individual customers often include smaller-scale users, such as independent crypto miners. Source: NBIO.io Website. Retrieved July 22, 2025. Having said that, NA launched in December 2024 an upgraded computing device with the Cuckoo 3.0 chip . It’s their latest-generation ASIC chip for HTC. However, it’s particularly useful for mining cryptocurrencies or other Web3 infrastructure workloads. This chip version offers better computing power and efficiency, with a single-core performance of 1.2 gigahashes per second (GH/s) and energy efficiency of 0.14 watts per megahash (W/MHash). To give you an idea, this actually represents an 83% improvement compared to the previous generation, which had more energy consumption and reached 0.79 W/MHash. Chip Differentiators And Crypto Strategy Moreover, NA’s Cuckoo chips are built for the V2 series. These chips are intended for home and small-scale miners that feature silent operation and high performance with low energy consumption. NA also released the floating-point unit ( FPU ) 3.0 architecture built as an ASIC and optimized for specific tasks like AI inference or blockchain processing. The key innovation is the integration of 3D-stacked DRAM for bandwidth increment (up to 24 TB/s) and reduced latency and power consumption. They achieved these efficiencies thanks to the shortening distances between memory and logic using a smart network-on-chip. Source: NA’s Annual Report. April 2025. Essentially, this gives NA’s chip better internal connections and overall improves its competitiveness in the ASIC market for crypto mining. Furthermore, NA’s latest earnings call mentioned they are officially establishing their Bitcoin value investment as a business unit. Their idea is to leverage the global trend of increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Currently, NA has a segment focused on holding, managing, and expanding its BTC assets. This formal status requires board-level oversight and controls integrated into public filings, as crypto is heavily regulated in China. As of recently, NA holds approximately 400 BTC , valued at around $40 million. On top of that, NA expanded its crypto holdings by buying 120,000 Binance (BNB) tokens. That amounts to a combined total (BTC and BNB) of approximately $160 million. Source: Seeking Alpha. But more interestingly, NA is not just investing in BNB. Instead, it seems this ecosystem is more of a strategic play for the company as a whole. NA’s management is keen on positioning itself as a major long-term holder and financial backer of the Binance ecosystem. Although in the long run they aim to control 5%–10% of BNB’s circulating supply, which should give them a material stake in that ecosystem. It’s also an extremely ambitious target since BNB’s market cap is approximately $106.7 billion , so just 5% of that value would be equivalent to roughly $5.3 billion. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, NA trades at a $139.2 million market cap, so it remains a relatively small company nonetheless. Their recent annual report shows that their balance sheet holds $4.5 million in cash and $33.8 million in cryptocurrencies (by year-end 2024). NA also reported almost $27.0 million in financial debt (aside from other regular operating liabilities), suggesting it’s relatively indebted already. And in June 2025, they announced a whopping $500 million note deal to continue financing future crypto purchases. Source: Binance. A more recent update shows their crypto holdings amount to approximately $160.0 million as of July 2025. And I do have to give them credit for their latest BNB buy, since their price average is around $672.45, and BNB is trading at about $767.04 already. So, this strategy has worked out for NA so far, but we’ll have to wait and see if, in the long run, this pays off. It’s also worth mentioning that NA is partnering with Orbiter Finance to launch a stablecoin called NBNB.io . They’re aiming for a potential Q4 2025 release, and NA is applying for licenses in Hong Kong to issue these fiat-referenced stablecoins related to the Hong Kong dollar ((HKD)) and offshore Chinese Yuan (RMB). Additionally, NA intends to build a technical infrastructure for stablecoins compatible with the BTS and BNB chains. With stablecoins as core Web3 infrastructure, NA aims to integrate them into cross-chain products, including NBNB.io , via their partner Orbiter Finance. Source: NBIO.io Website. Retrieved July 22, 2025. It’s true that these moves can potentially add a new revenue stream to the chip design and crypto reserves businesses. However, I remain skeptical about their actual competitive prospects with their new stablecoin project. After all, USDT and USDC are well-entrenched and mass-adopted stablecoins in crypto. Those stablecoin alternatives are also regulated, and you can even bet on USDC adoption through Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ). So, in that sense, I’m not as optimistic about this stablecoin strategic direction that NA’s management is now focusing on. Yet, this stablecoin bet also seems similar to their incredibly ambitious aim of controlling 5%–10% of BNB’s circulating supply. It sounds great on paper, but in practice, it’s extremely difficult to achieve. After all, 5%-10% of BNB would amount to several billions of dollars in capital investments, which NA simply doesn’t have at this point. Ostensibly, they’ll finance their purchases with debt (or more stock issuance), but I’m not even sure they can access such a huge amount of loans. NA remains a relatively small microcap for all intents and purposes, so I doubt lenders will simply loan those amounts to an otherwise unprofitable company . Likewise, their near-term revenue prospects seem unremarkable as well. In fact, in 2024, they only generated about $5.6 million in total revenues. Source: Seeking Alpha. Nonetheless, it does show that NA is quickly becoming a leveraged bet in crypto, particularly in BTC and BNB. So, I anticipate the stock will become increasingly volatile as NA’s leverage factor increases with its crypto holdings. On the bull case, BNB and BTC both rally, and NA benefits greatly from such unrealized gains. But the flip side is equally true, and the downside could be substantial and swift since crypto is already notably volatile. If you add to that volatility leverage (like NA is doing), then it’s clear that new investors are taking a substantial risk with the stock. I also estimate they burned through $24.5 million in 2024 . Note that I got that figure by simply adding their cash flows from operations and CAPEX during that period (excluding cryptocurrency purchases). In contrast, we know they had just about $4.5 million in cash (year-end 2024) and about $160 million in cryptocurrencies (July 2025). So, if we combine those figures, it suggests a cash runway of around 6.7 years, which would seem extremely healthy. However, we know they don’t intend to sell their crypto holdings, meaning that their actual runway is probably much shorter. Source: Seeking Alpha. If anything, management wants to continue investing in BTC and BNB. Thus, it’s clear to me that NA will likely keep on piling on more debt or issuing more stock to finance its operations and cryptocurrency purchases. And all of this paints a picture that seems somewhat reckless to me, which is why I can’t give them a bullish rating. I also believe their high-risk, high-reward strategy could pay off massively if BTC and BNB rally and if their stablecoin is a success. That’s why I feel a “Hold” rating at these levels seems fair. Conclusion: Sidelines For Now Overall, I get the impression that NA’s ambitions are extremely high and maybe a bit unrealistic. They want to control a sizeable stake in the huge BNB ecosystem while also launching a stablecoin contender against USDT or USDC, which are well-entrenched alternatives. These two initiatives could definitely pay off significantly, but I remain skeptical since NA’s financial resources are clearly a very limiting factor. So far, NA has resorted to taking on debt and issuing shares to finance these goals, but this does increase its risk factor proportionally. Hence, I think NA is now a very high-risk, high-reward play in crypto rather than a straight-up miner. In my view, I believe this is simply too speculative to warrant a bullish rating, which is why I lean towards a “Hold” for now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804781-nanolabs-ambitious-binance-coin-bet-transforms-chip-maker-into-crypto-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BNB|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE","BNB-USD|BTC-USD|NA",cryptocompare
2025-07-26T10:38:08,"What’s the Latest on the Big Altcoin Season Everyone’s Dreaming About? Coinbase Analysts Respond","The recent sharp sell-off in the cryptocurrency market comes after weeks of strong capital flows into small-cap altcoins. This activity has fueled debate in the market about whether altcoin season has arrived. CoinGlass's Altcoin Seasonal Index evaluates altcoins' performance against Bitcoin on a scale of 0 to 100. This index, which rose to 59 on Monday, fell to 41 as of Friday. Coinbase Head of Research David Duong noted in a report that the altcoin market, excluding stablecoins, has nearly doubled since April. However, this week's pullback was blamed on investors taking excessive risks in leveraged altcoin positions. Related News: Analytics Firm Issues Warning: Unusual Data Coming in Bitcoin Options - Here's What It Signals According to the report, the Altcoin Open Interest Dominance metric has risen to 1.6. This ratio represents the ratio of the dollar amount tied up in altcoin derivatives contracts to Bitcoin contracts and has been a precursor to market corrections in the past. Duong stated that a decrease in this ratio would signal a healthy deleveraging in the market, otherwise, further volatility could occur. The Bitcoin Dominance metric is crucial for the sustainability of the altcoin season. This metric, which measures BTC's share of the total crypto market, has fallen below its 200-day moving average, marking the first time it's fallen below that level since January 2025. “A sustained move below the 200-day moving average could confirm an altcoin season. Such situations have preceded weeks of altcoin dominance in the past (e.g., in 2021),” Duong said. However, he added that investors should wait for a few more closes below this level to take a more cautious position. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-26T10:37:03,"Less Than 1 BTC Might Be Enough to Retire: Here’s Why","The question of how much Bitcoin is needed to retire has probably been asked by most investors, and recent research may now have the answer. Bitcoin researcher and investor ‘Smitty’ has created a model calculating how much BTC is needed to retire on. “Most people in most countries still need less than 1 BTC for 2035 [retirement],” he stated before adding that if retiring this year, most countries need between one and ten BTC. The model is based on each country’s average income level, adjusted for inflation, age at retirement, and utilizing Bitcoin’s power law model for predicting prices. Retiring on Bitcoin Naturally, those living in expensive countries such as the United States and most of Europe will need more Bitcoin to maintain their lifestyles during retirement. However, for more than half of the countries listed, less than 1 BTC would be enough to retire on for most people in 2035. For retirement in 2045, people in nearly all countries aside from a handful of super wealthy places would need less than 1 BTC, and in many, just 0.1 BTC would be enough, according to the research. How much Bitcoin does the average person need to retire? Here, its calculated and presented in radial charts for 96 countries, ages 5 – 75, retiring in 2025 – 2055. – – – Based on each country’s average income level, adjusted for inflation (7% M2 expansion), and of course… pic.twitter.com/6Y9DMoHyeI — Sminston With (@sminston_with) July 23, 2025 The findings presume that Bitcoin prices will continue to increase in accordance with the power law model, which is derived by taking resistance and support bands of BTC. These bands are derived by taking a linear regression of the historical Bitcoin price to derive a “power law,” which is represented as a straight line showing the correlation between BTC’s price and time. By 2035, BTC will be valued at $1.7 million, according to power law projections, more than enough to retire on for most people. One Coiners a Rare Breed Additionally, holding just one BTC now is rarer than being a millionaire. According to blockchain data, the actual number of unique people who own 1 Bitcoin is around 800,000 to 850,000, but this is just an estimate. With 8 billion people on the planet, “wholecoiners” represent just 0.01% to 0.02% of the population, and those holding 1 BTC are also rarer than the estimated 16 million millionaires globally.

The RSI at 62.22 indicates overbought conditions. However, a bullish continuation could take the price to $200–$209 resistance zone. Otherwise, a pullback toward the $158–$152.5 support zone remains on the table. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $158 $180 $209 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $11.77 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $1.05B–$498M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-26T10:30:17,"Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000","Bitcoin looks to be on the verge of a breakdown after rallying to $123,000 all-time highs earlier in the month. This reversal has taken the market by surprise, with the altcoin market, once again, bearing the brunt of the losses. Now, as the Bitcoin price reaches an important level, the questions of whether this is the start of a bear trend or if there will be a bounce in price have become more urgent. Bitcoin Trends Low After New Highs After the reversal back into the $117,000 levels, crypto analyst TehThomas has published an analysis outlining the current Bitcoin price trend and where it could be headed next. So far, the analyst explains that Bitcoin is still trading in a well-defined trend after being rejected from the upper resistance zone at $120,000 multiple times. However, there is still a lot of bite from its support levels below, which could be its saving grace. Related Reading: Cup And Saucer Pattern Says XRP Price Rally Is Not Done As the analyst explains, the fact that the support continues to hold shows that there is still a lot of buying going on for Bitcoin. This puts the support very tight around this area, but also makes it a dangerous territory for the bulls. It is possible that there is a sweep back to these lows, and Thomas explains that such a move would engineer sell-side liquidity. There is also a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at the $121,000 level, which continues to be defended. This is where most of the resistance has come from, pushing the price back below $118,000 multiple times already. Thus, this FVG is the next level to reclaim in the campaign for new highs. Bouncing Back From Lows If the sweep back toward the lows is completed, it is not entirely bearish for the Bitcoin price and could, in fact, be the move that helps to trigger the next wave of uptrend. The analyst explains that buyers would have to step back in at this level, with support sitting firmly at $116,000. This accumulation during consolidation would be inherently bullish. Related Reading: Tether Investments Extend Beyond Bitcoin Amid Record Profits — Details Looking back at the FVG, the analyst explains that it could act as a magnet if the price begins to rise again. Nevertheless, all of this depends on the Bitcoin price dipping back to support and then bouncing off again. The sweep of liquidity at the lows and the bounce would offer confirmation that the price is going to keep trending upward. However, there is still the possibility of a price breakdown from here. Thomas points to an invalidation of the bullish thesis if support at $116,000 fails to hold and there is no immediate recovery. “Bitcoin remains locked in a clear range, and until the breakout happens, the edges of that range offer the best trading opportunities,” the analyst explained.

The BNB price prediction anticipates a potential high of $1,292 in 2025. Binance price may reach a maximum of $2,749 by 2030. Binance Coin has been the talk of the town after its euphoric run to claim a new all-time high at $809.31. The buzz is also fueled by Forbes’ estimation of Changpeng Zhao holding 64% of BNB’s supply, which is 95M tokens worth about $76 billion. Amid the changing landscape, the Binance Coin fundamentals remain solid, with our new all-time high target at around the $1000 level. However, the underlying uncertainties amid the global tensions raise questions like, “Is Binance safe or not?” or “Will Binance go higher in 2025?” To answer these questions and provide a clear view of the BNB price action, we present our latest Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

BNB Coin Price Prediction for August 2025 BNB’s strong uptrend remains intact, with the price testing current levels at $783.75 after briefly hitting $809.31. The RSI at 77.65 indicates overbought conditions, which justifies the current pullback. However, sustained momentum above current levels could propel BNB toward $820 and even $860 in August. Key support lies at $684. A short-term consolidation around $780–$800 is likely before the next leg up, provided macro conditions and sentiment stay bullish. Volatility remains elevated as bulls eye higher resistances.

2025-07-26T10:22:49,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Is the $3,500 Threshold ETH’s Launchpad for a New Rally?","Ethereum price has established the $3,500 threshold as a critical launchpad level, while smart money rotation from Bitcoin creates unprecedented institutional demand. ETFs have purchased 1,368,980 ETH this month, compared to only 72,513 ETH minted, effectively buying 18 months’ worth of supply in just three weeks. This supply shock coincides with extreme bearish positioning in CME futures reaching -13,236 contracts, creating substantial fuel for short-covering rallies. Currently trading at $3,708, Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels around $2,600-$2,700 and is approaching the critical $4,000 zone that separates consolidation from explosive breakout territory. Source: TradingView Technical analysis reveals that ETH has been within a massive broadening wedge formation since 2023, with the current positioning testing the upper boundary of this formation. Combined with extreme short positioning and record ETF inflows, the confluence suggests Ethereum may be entering the acceleration phase toward new all-time highs above $4,878. Broadening Wedge Breakout Targets $4,800 Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a massive broadening wedge formation with expanding oscillations that typically precede explosive breakouts. Currently testing the upper boundary around $3,742, ETH approaches the critical $4,000 resistance, which represents the key breakout level of the pattern. $ETH is just one God candle away from the biggest breakout. Once that happens, ETH will pump straight above the previous ATH. It seems like another mic-drop moment is coming for @EricTrump . pic.twitter.com/Unti8pPVXi — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) July 26, 2025 The ascending trendline provides crucial support, while horizontal resistance must be overcome for the major breakout scenario. The mathematical structure suggests that compressed energy exists within the formation, which could produce explosive movements once the upper boundary breaks decisively. Projection targets of $4,800 indicate a measured move potential, calculated from the wedge width, representing approximately 30% upside from current levels. The current positioning suggests ETH is completing the final consolidation phase before resolution toward much higher targets that could exceed previous all-time highs above $4,878. Ethereum Price Prediction: Extreme Short Positioning Fuels Covering Rally CME Ethereum futures data reveals unprecedented bearish positioning reaching -13,236 contracts, representing the most extreme short interest in the dataset’s history. Source: Wise Advice on X This capitulation-level positioning typically precedes significant upward moves as forced covering accelerates price gains. Even modest upward moves could trigger cascading short covering that accelerates gains beyond normal technical resistance. Recent momentum shows “a record-setting 9 daily candles” followed by minimal corrections, describing patterns characteristic of strong trending moves. This progression from support levels through resistance breakouts illustrates methodical institutional accumulation, with foundations being built at each level. The $4,000 target for “end of month” appears achievable given current momentum and short covering, providing additional upward pressure beyond normal buying demand as extreme positioning unwinds. $ETH – #Ethereum will inevitably break its all-time high. pic.twitter.com/hT1vmtWBI1 — Crypto Caesar (@CryptoCaesarTA) July 25, 2025 Snorter: Last Days to Join $2 Presale Success Ethereum’s approach to breaking out above $4,000 and potentially accelerating to $4,800 targets creates ideal conditions for advanced trading strategies. Snorter’s $SNORT token presale has raised over $2 million, with limited allocation remaining before the window closes permanently ahead of Q3 2025 mainnet launch. Early investors are securing final positions in the Telegram-native trading bot positioned for explosive market conditions. The $SNORT token unlocks multiple revenue streams through the expanding ecosystem. Staking rewards reach up to 207% APY for early participants, while reduced trading fees at 0.85% provide ongoing advantages during high-volume trading periods. Token holders gain governance rights and early access to new launches, creating additional value beyond basic trading functionality. Market projections estimate that $SNORT could reach $0.65 by late 2025, driven by the adoption of utility during periods of increased trading volumes. The presale’s limited remaining allocation and the approaching Q3 launch create a final opportunity for investors seeking the next big utility-backed token.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that Ethereum could soon hit $4,000, especially if Bitcoin continues climbing toward $120,000. So, is Ethereum getting ready for its next big rally, for the first time in over a year? Strong Resistance, But No Real Drop Yet Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe expected Ethereum to drop before a big move, but that didn’t happen. Instead, ETH kept climbing and has now tested the $3,750–$3,800 zone four times, a sign that buyers are getting stronger. Van de Poppe’s chart hints that ETH might dip toward $3,250 if it shakes out some long positions first. But even if that happens, the overall trend still looks bullish. I expected to see some sort of deeper correction on $ETH , didn't come. Given that there has been four tests of the resistance already, I would assume that when #Bitcoin goes to $120K+, $ETH goes to $4K and we'll see #Altcoins provide double digit returns. pic.twitter.com/id7jpDuZem — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 26, 2025 However, Ethereum is already up 138% from its yearly low and is showing strong patterns like an inverse head-and-shoulders and a bullish pennant. These often appear before big price rallies. If ETH breaks above $3,800 with good volume, it could quickly shoot toward $4,000, much sooner than many expect. Bitcoin’s Role in the Bigger Picture Further, Michael believes Ethereum’s next big move is closely tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin can successfully rally toward $120,000, a target that’s gaining popularity, it could act like a spark that lights the altcoin market. In that case, Ethereum could easily shoot past $4,000, and many altcoins might follow with double-digit gains. ETF Inflows Fuel the Bullish Sentiment On top of it, Ethereum’s growing interest from institutional investors has given a push to its price. According to SoSoValue , Ethereum ETFs saw over $1.39 billion in inflows this week. While that’s lower than last week’s $2.18 billion, it’s still the 11th week in a row that institutions have been buying in. This steady demand shows that big money still believes Ethereum has more room to run.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoins-set-for-double-digit-returns-with-ethereum-price-heading-to-4k/,"ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

This is the third time it’s reached this zone during the current bull run, but only at its lower boundary (80%), well below major peaks seen before. Analysts say it’s a warning sign for investors to stay cautious, but it doesn’t suggest a big drop is imminent.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/crypto-live-news/bitcoin-market-shows-caution-as-ibci-enters-distribution-zone/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","Short News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
