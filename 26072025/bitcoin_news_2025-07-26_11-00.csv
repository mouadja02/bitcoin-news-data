2025-07-26T08:55:00,"MANTA price prediction 2025-2031: Will Manta Network survive or crash?","Key Takeaways : MANTA price faces a surge toward $0.23. Our Manta price forecast expects Manta price to surge to a maximum level of $3.6 in 2025. In 2030, Manta price prediction expects Manta price to record a maximum level of $22.28. Launched in September 2023, Manta Network gained significant attention within the cryptocurrency community after its token generation event, leading to trending status on major coin aggregators and news outlets. Beyond the initial buzz, Manta Network presents innovative technology through a modular zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup for Ethereum , featuring Solidity smart contracts and a decentralized identity layer one network focusing on compliance. This article will explore the details of the Manta Network and examine potential future price movements of its native token, $MANTA, to provide a comprehensive MANTA price prediction.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume surged to $2.55 million, showing a surge in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.228, surging by over 3.2% in the last 24 hours. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and hovers around 51, showing that bulls are controlling the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart.

MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.33, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.263, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.339. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.213, resulting in a correction to $0.168. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.23. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.21. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.25, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter), describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction July 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In July, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.29. The average price is expected to be around $0.2.

2025-07-26T08:54:37,"YBIT Seems The Least Appealing Bitcoin Option Strategy","Summary YBIT offers a high monthly yield through a dynamic options approach, but its complexity could make it less suitable for some portfolios. Its dynamic structure and higher yield (over 40%) make it intriguing but prone to NAV erosion. This is why it’s better to treat it as a tactical tool for spot trades. It has high costs but is still fairly liquid despite its low AUM. Despite remaining high‑NAV‑erosion‑risk solutions, among the high‑income Bitcoin options, BTCI seems to offer more NAV protection. “But did you know that Bitcoin can become a yield‑generating asset?” That was the opening remark from a colleague of mine, someone “purely” from the banking world, just back from a road show of his network. He then told me about YieldMax™ Bitcoin Option Income ETF ( YBIT ) : first, it made me reflect on how here on Seeking Alpha we stay one step ahead when it comes to “financial engineering”; then, on how option income strategy ETFs are becoming an increasingly popular component, even in institutional circuits; and finally, on how little people actually understand what we’re talking about. My opinion? Yes, the strategic approach proposed by YBIT is interesting, but it’s not suitable for every type of portfolio, and, above all, it’s a step behind other solutions: in my view, BTCI positions itself better. But before explaining why, you need to know that … The Vision Of … YieldMax is always very clear : the primary goal is to create a current monthly income. Tracking Bitcoin , we could say, is a sort of side question for the management. Data by YCharts And I have to say, the way they achieve this goal is more articulated than what has been done with other ETFs: simply because it’s “dynamic.” That is, they don’t use a single strategy; instead, they have a book of alternatives, and in this it reminds me a bit of LFGY , a YieldMax ETF that I honestly appreciate. According to the prospectus , YBIT can make use of synthetic covered calls: buying calls + selling puts to replicate the underlying ETP without physically owning it. But also the classic standard covered call writing, selling out‑of‑the‑money calls (0%–15% above the current price), as well as opportunistic credit call spreads, meaning in certain cases they sell calls and buy higher calls to capture part of the additional upside. All this with intensive use of FLEX options (customized options) and collateral in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities from 6 months to 2 years. synthetic covered calls classic standard covered call opportunistic credit call spreads Let me say it: a book of strategies that almost seems to tell the investor, “trust our management, we will manage to profit through various market phases.” That semi‑active management that often, however, is an illusion of security . But let’s get straight to the point… is it really so? Partly Yes, But… First of all, this “multi‑strategy option” approach has a cost: 4.76% when adding up the various items. A factor that certainly cannot be ignored. YBIT - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) And it has a low AUM of $147M, which shifts my concern to liquidity. A concern that is unfounded, because the bid/ask spread is 0.09%, therefore quite tight, and surprisingly, the average daily volume is over 930% higher than the average: so the slippage risk is reduced compared to other ETFs with that level of AUM. YBIT - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) But costs are secondary, and what we care about is performance: a variable element by definition, even though the yield since inception has been pleasantly steady, especially in distributions. As of now we are talking about a TTM yield of around 78%, paid monthly. A distribution that, judging from the 19a filings , is 97% ROC and only 2.59% income. YBIT - Dividend Grade (Seeking Alpha) Considering that the SEC yield is 1.54%, it means the income naturally comes from option premiums. So, in my view, to really understand whether the multi‑strategy approach is or isn’t an “illusion of security,” I look at the holding distribution. Today’s Composition Is Not The Same As Yesterday’s (Or Tomorrow’s) But this is exactly its strength. The strategy changes, theoretically adapting to market conditions: in other words, it addresses one of the main criticisms, the statistical limits of buy‑write (covered call strategy). It’s therefore impossible not to mention the constant rolling of options and the high turnover (28% in the first half) along with high implicit costs. Today, its composition is this: YBIT - Holding distribution (Seeking Alpha) ~50% options on IBIT ~45% Treasury Bills and Notes~1.7% Money Market FundCash & Other negative (–0.55%) Peer Analysis: The Illusion Of Security Quick thought: this dynamism gives YBIT a hedge. In the end, why not? Theoretically, it makes sense. The problem is that there is a chasm between theory and practice. Let me explain: Let’s suppose an investor is interested in adding an ETF of this type to a portfolio, presumably to optimize cash flows and indirectly track, through total return, at least the performance of BTC, because they are a strong supporter of the decentralized market. Is YBIT the most suitable solution? In this sense, it may help to know that, beyond YBIT, there are two other solutions worth considering: YBTC and BTCI. YBIT - YBTC - BTCI : Fund profile (Seeking Alpha) Peer YBTC: For the strategy, it uses ETFs on Bitcoin. It has a less dynamic structure , but in my opinion, it is similar to YBIT. With a medium‑aggressive distribution of about 42% annually (naturally variable), and a weekly distribution. YBTC - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) BTCI: it uses a Cayman subsidiary to hold Spot Bitcoin ETPs up to 25% of assets. It has a more conservative capital distribution compared to the first two, with a declared target of 25–30% annually in the prospectus, deliberately contained to preserve NAV (still actively managed, but there seems to be less flexibility in the strategies). It uses index options with Section 1256 treatment. BTCI - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) Risk And My Opinion What to choose? A superficial answer: excluding YBTC, because it is very similar to YBIT, the most obvious answer is YBIT, given that it has a yield of more than three times BTCI’s target. Yet, in my view, over the long term it would be a less balanced solution. My choice? With the same total return, I believe choosing the more conservative capital approach also optimizes cash flows over time (simply put, the yield leverages a larger principal). And since BTCI’s yield is still high (over 25%), I prefer BTCI. YBIT, YBTC, BTCI : Price return (Seeking Alpha) But Beware The multi‑strategy approach changes the picture; I told myself: the management might actually succeed in setting up a truly conservative multi‑strategy approach during periods of strong BTC swings, both negative and positive. This could lead YBIT’s performance to distance itself from BTCI’s. YBIT - YBTC - BTCI: Total return (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion But concretely, I prefer a solution that, regardless, manages better to preserve NAV, even though, clearly, this is not easy with BTCI either, especially over the long term and especially with option‑income‑oriented ETFs. In the end, these ETFs are like a scale: if you add too much weight to distributions, in my view these ETFs stop being core or long‑term satellite components of a portfolio and become tactical and strategic allocations for certain market phases. And YBIT, in my opinion, fully represents this setup, which is why, if I had to think of a yield‑generating alternative to Bitcoin to optimize income distribution, I would rather opt for solutions with more conservative NAV management and lower costs: in this sense, BTCI.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804761-ybit-seems-the-least-appealing-bitcoin-option-strategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","YBTC|BTCI|YBIT",cryptocompare

2025-07-26T08:41:02,"Galaxy Digital sold over 80,000 bitcoins for a Satoshi-era investor","Galaxy Digital has facilitated the sale of over 80,000 bitcoin, an amount worth more than $9 billion, for a Satoshi-era investor in what’s now being called one of the biggest transactions in crypto history. This was confirmed by Galaxy in a statement released today. The anonymous client behind the sale is one of the earliest holders of bitcoin, with the transaction forming part of what the firm described as a long-term estate planning strategy. The sale happened on Thursday, when Mike Novogratz’s firm began sending billions in BTC to exchanges. The total amount moved was around $4 billion, with wallet activity traced by Arkham Analytics. The act of moving coins to exchanges doesn’t automatically mean a liquidation, but in this case, Galaxy later withdrew about $1.15 billion in stablecoins, meaning that a significant portion of the assets had in fact already been sold. Sale pulls early coins into circulation and shakes up price movement Galaxy didn’t identify the seller but described the move as a carefully planned financial step by the investor, who had sat on this stash since the early 2010s or earlier. Bitcoin’s price, which had dropped to under $115,000 overnight, bounced back slightly on Friday to $117,200, though it still remained 1.2% down over the previous 24 hours. That rebound came despite large volumes moving into active markets. The crypto had been trading within a narrow range for the past four days. While the sale didn’t crash the market, it did raise new concerns about liquidity and sell-side pressure. As trading volume picked up, debates over valuation resurfaced. Bitcoin’s worth, like always, hinged on what the next buyer is willing to pay. Citigroup report breaks down new valuation models and trends On the same day the sale became public, Citigroup analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert released a detailed report on how to assess bitcoin’s price. “The price of bitcoin ultimately depends on how many people want to hold it,” the report said. The updated framework introduced by Citi combined previous approaches and incorporated recent macro changes. The analysis built on earlier work from 2022, which had included electricity cost as a price floor, a stock-to-flow ratio for gauging scarcity, adoption levels to evaluate the network, and macroeconomic trends, specifically, how the coin correlates with equities and the dollar. The latest update didn’t just rehash those points. It introduced a more urgent tone, claiming that crypto is now too significant to be ignored. “Back in 2022, the question was whether crypto had any impact on the real economy. Today, the question is how much exposure investors already have—whether they realize it or not,” Saunders said. The report said that crypto assets have grown to the point where their market caps rival major public companies, and they’re now embedded in top financial indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell. One figure stood out. Crypto-related holdings now account for 7.6% by weight in Bloomberg’s U.S. Convertible Liquid Bond Index. Much of that exposure ties back to MicroStrategy, which has long been a major institutional holder of bitcoin . That number alone is why, as Citi put it, “even crypto-agnostic clients must now track these markets.” The purpose of the new model was to help clients understand their crypto exposure without guessing or relying on rough price estimates. And while adoption remains one of the core inputs, Citi warned that increased involvement from traditional finance, especially if regulatory clarity continues, will blur the lines between crypto and the traditional market even more. “Traditional institutions are already in it, whether they like it or not,” Rupert added. “The regulatory signals are clearer, and the stakes are higher.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-26T08:35:24,"Top Investor Releases His 2025 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Predictions","Crypto strategist and investor Armando Pantoja has reaffirmed his price targets for 2025 across three leading digital assets: XRP, Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH). According to his latest tweet, Pantoja stated that his projections remain unchanged since first sharing them publicly during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. His forecast outlines a target of $8 to $12 for XRP, $250,000 for Bitcoin, and between $10,000 and $12,000 for Ethereum. The tweet included a direct quote of the original targets and emphasized their consistency over time. Pantoja wrote, “2025 Targets: XRP = $8–$12, BTC = $250k, ETH = $10k–$12k. These targets haven’t changed since I called them out @NYSE in 2023.” There was no elaboration on what data models or technical frameworks were used to derive these values. However, the repetition of the message appears to reinforce his confidence in the models’ accuracy. 2025 Targets: $XRP = $8-$12 $BTC = $250k $ETH = $10k – $12k These targets haven't changed since I called them out @NYSE in 2023. pic.twitter.com/XEGOKyfkLq — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 24, 2025 Crypto Community Reactions The post gained attention from several figures in the crypto community who offered their interpretations. A user by the name RenegadeTV expressed the view that while the predictions for BTC and ETH were fair, the projection for XRP was modest. “Too low on XRP. About right on BTC and ETH could go closer to 18k. XRP will be much higher,” RenegadeTV commented. The sentiment suggested a belief that XRP’s long-term value could exceed the $12 upper limit proposed by Pantoja, potentially due to its increasing adoption or pending regulatory developments. Another response came from Darius Ellis, who acknowledged the projection and said it was “locked in.” He argued that the valuation range for XRP was not merely technical but based on the asset’s evolving role in financial infrastructure. He wrote, “$8–12 XRP isn’t just a chart call, it reflects growing utility, settlement velocity, and the rails being built in silence.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went on to add that the broader market was overlooking the significance of infrastructure-based digital assets, suggesting that once the ecosystem matures, gains would be measured in “multiples, not percentages.” He concluded by proposing that the community revisit the post after more developments. Price Forecasts Emphasize Confidence Amid Market Uncertainty Pantoja’s reaffirmation of his 2025 targets arrives at a time when the crypto market continues to experience short-term volatility, with all three assets experiencing price fluctuations in response to macroeconomic factors, regulatory shifts, and institutional involvement. Despite these short-term uncertainties, Pantoja’s decision to stick to his earlier projections appears to reflect a long-term conviction about digital assets’ maturing fundamentals and broader adoption trajectory. While some analysts might view his BTC and ETH projections as optimistic, they fall within the broader range of institutional outlooks that assume exponential growth if certain conditions are met. However, the XRP forecast continues to attract attention, partly due to the ongoing legal and regulatory developments surrounding its classification and use cases in global finance. Armando Pantoja has made it clear that he stands by his targets set two years prior, reiterating them now with the same conviction. As 2025 proceeds, attention is likely to remain fixed on how well these forecasts hold up against the realities of market dynamics and blockchain adoption curves.

Brazil’s capital markets take a key step toward digitalisation VERT has built a revolutionary blockchain platform for private credit on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with the goal of improving securitisation operations’ efficiency and transparency. This revolutionary technology automates critical procedures in structured credit, from issue to settlement, with real-time tracking and full traceability. As a result, the Brazilian financial system is becoming more aligned with global financial digitisation trends, paving the way for a more contemporary, adaptable, and secure infrastructure. The platform’s first milestone was the issuance of a 700-million-real Agribusiness Receivables Certificate (CRA), which is equivalent to around $130 million. VERT’s solution, which leverages XRPL’s low costs and speedy settlement capabilities, as well as the XRPL EVM Sidechain for smart contract functionality, introduces new levels of transparency, cost-efficiency, and coordination. The platform, which is backed by Ripple, conforms with Brazilian regulations and boosts investor confidence. With over 350 structured credit transactions and $10.51 billion in assets under management, VERT solidifies its leading position by advancing blockchain innovation in regulated capital markets. Grupo Murano bets big on Bitcoin with $10 billion treasury strategy Mexican real estate firm Grupo Murano has announced that it will invest as much as $10 billion into Bitcoin over five years to build a Bitcoin treasury. The firm, known for designing hotels, resorts, and shopping malls in Mexico, has joined the ranks of companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a core strategic reserve asset, a trend that is expected to spread globally. Grupo Murano not only diversifies its portfolio by exposing up to 80% of its assets to Bitcoin, but it also embraces digital transformation across its whole order book. The company is placing Bitcoin ATMs in its venues. This bold move catapults Murano into the ranks of leading global companies such as Méliuz, Vanadi Coffee, and Trump Media that also have Bitcoin in their treasuries. Ripio and Tapi’s partnership brings crypto payments to Argentina Argentine crypto exchange Ripio has teamed up with payment FinTech Tapi to allow users to pay for more than 5,000 services directly through the Ripio app , including utilities, phone bills, internet, school fees and subscription services. With this integration, users can now process these payments with cryptocurrencies, without the need to convert to Argentine pesos, representing a difference between crypto as an asset for investments to crypto as a medium of exchange. Ripio operates in several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, and provides access to major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. Supported by cross-chain QR codes and seamless conversion in real time, this new feature simplifies payments in compliance with local laws while reinforcing user trust.

Prominent altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are making significant moves in response. Amid this excitement, a newcomer named XYZVerse surfaces as a potential wildcard. Could this unexpected player shift the market's direction in unforeseen ways? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin (BTC) has shown significant movement over recent months. In the past month, its price increased by 12.04%, and over the last six months, it saw a rise of 12.66%. However, the past week experienced a slight dip of 0.42%, bringing the current price range between $114,610 and $120,963. The cryptocurrency is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, which are $118,387 and $118,297 respectively. This suggests a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.16, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic value is 64.29, showing neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The MACD level is at -52.57, pointing to potential bearish sentiment. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $124,685. Breaking above this could push the price toward the second resistance at $131,038, an increase of roughly 9%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $111,979. If the price falls below this, it may test the second support level of $105,626, which would be a decrease of about 5%. The data suggests Bitcoin may continue to trade within these levels in the short term. Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP has seen notable movement recently. Over the past month, its price surged by about 42.54%, indicating strong bullish momentum. Currently trading between $2.95 and $3.81, the price is near the 10-day simple moving average of $3.12 but below the 100-day average of $3.44. This suggests a short-term uptrend is in play. Despite the monthly gain, the 6-month change shows a slight dip of 0.54%. The Relative Strength Index stands at 34.65, nearing oversold territory, which might hint at a potential price rebound. The MACD level is negative at -0.0805, suggesting bearish tendencies, but the substantial monthly increase could offset this outlook. If XRP breaks above the resistance at $4.16, it could aim for the next level at $5.02, representing an increase of over 30% from current levels. On the downside, support lies at $2.45, and further at $1.60 if selling intensifies. These key levels will be crucial in determining XRP's next move. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin (DOGE) has been active lately. In the past week, its price increased by 8.94%. Over the last month, it surged by 42.47%. However, in the past six months, it decreased by 33.47%. This shows a recent upward trend after a significant drop. Currently, DOGE trades between $0.22 and $0.31. The nearest resistance level is at $0.34. If it breaks this, the price could rise toward the second resistance at $0.43. That would be an increase of around 38%. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.16. Falling below this might lead to the second support at $0.06647. Technical indicators give mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.24, while the 100-day is $0.26. The Relative Strength Index is 37.25, suggesting DOGE is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is -0.0058, indicating slight bearish momentum. Based on these factors, DOGE's price could continue to rise if momentum holds, or it might face a decline if selling pressure increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen mixed performance. In the past week, its price fell 6.68%, ranging from $0.00001356 to $0.00001666. Over the last month, it rose 15.99%. Yet, over six months, SHIB declined 32.77%, showing a longer-term downward trend. Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI is 34.77, close to oversold levels, suggesting a possible rebound. The 10-day SMA at $0.00001358 is below the 100-day SMA of $0.00001497, indicating short-term bearish momentum. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0000003217, hinting at potential continued decline. Key levels to watch are support at $0.00001160 and resistance at $0.00001780. Dropping below support could lead SHIB to the next support at $0.000008506, a decrease of about 29%. Surpassing resistance may push the price toward $0.00002090, a potential gain of roughly 26%. These movements could signal significant price changes. Conclusion While BTC, XRP, DOGE, and SHIB thrive in the bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success.
