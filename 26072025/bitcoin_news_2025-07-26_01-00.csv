This figure has grown by almost 50% since the end of May and could exceed last year‚Äôs record. The primary sources of capital inflow are crypto funds, the CME futures market, and venture investments. The main catalyst is an improved regulatory environment in the U.S. Analysts say the GENIUS Act has brought clarity to stablecoin regulation and set a benchmark for other countries. Another document, the CLARITY Act, could make the United States more attractive to crypto companies compared to the EU and its MiCA regulation, according to analysts. Improved legislation is stimulating activity in the markets. Venture capital funding has increased, and public companies are showing new momentum. Analysts have noted the successful IPO of Circle, as well as growth in new applications filed with the SEC. Demand for Ethereum Investors are also showing increased interest in altcoins. Ethereum has been the main beneficiary, thanks to its dominance in DeFi and its growing use in corporate reserves alongside Bitcoin. Asset managers are interested in launching altcoin ETFs with staking functionality. In particular, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund from BlackRock attracted $10 billion in a year, according to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas. He noted that this instrument became the third in history in terms of how quickly it reached this milestone. The first two are Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity. Balchunas also observed that assets in the fund grew from $5 billion to $10 billion in just ten days. The fund entered the top five in terms of inflows over the past week and month. On July 25, net inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs amounted to $332.2 million. Almost all of this amount‚Äî$324.6 million‚Äîcame from the BlackRock fund. The total inflow into all nine spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the U.S. reached $8.65 billion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of such products in May 2024.

(NASDAQ: GLXY), a financial investment firm focused on the crypto market, has announced the completion of the sale of one of the largest Bitcoin (BTC) troves in history. According to the announcement on Friday, July 25, Galaxy Digital finalized the sale of more than 80k BTC, worth over $9 billion based on the current market value of about $117k. ‚ÄúGalaxy completed the sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin ‚Äì valued at over $9 billion based on current market prices ‚Äì for a Satoshi-era investor, representing one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market. The transaction was part of the investor‚Äôs broader estate planning strategy,‚Äù Galaxy Digital noted . What the Satashi-era Exits Mean for the Bitcoin Market The strategic exit of the Satoshi-era investor marks the entrance of institutional capital to the Bitcoin market. Furthermore, the rising demand for the U.S. spot BTC ETFs by institutional investors has increased the overall cash inflow to the Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, the exit of early Bitcoin investors marks a potential onset of the 2025 altseason. Moreover, the demand for Ethereum and the wider altcoin market is evident through the spot ETF cash flows.

2025-07-25T22:19:22,"ETH to Lead BTC Over Next 6 Months, Says Galaxy CEO","Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming 3 to 6 months. During a Thursday interview with CNBC, the executive revealed that market conditions increasingly favor ETH‚Äôs upside. Corporate Interest and ETF Flows ‚ÄúI think Ethereum probably has a lot of chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months,‚Äù said Novogratz. He explained that big companies buying the asset was helping propel its rise.‚ÄùThe narrative of ETH is really powerful,‚Äù he added. Several publicly listed firms are now choosing to hold ETH in their treasuries, following the example set by Strategy, which opted for BTC as a reserve asset. These include SharpLink Gaming, which holds over 360,000 ETH; BitMine, which has more than 566,000 ETH and a goal to control 5% of the total supply; and Bit Digital, a mining firm with over 120,000 ETH on its books. Novogratz said that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price has ‚Äúcaught up a lot,‚Äù predicting that it will also hit the $4,000 ceiling several times in the future. CoinGecko data shows that ETH is trading around $3,659, up a slight 1.5% in the last seven days, after hitting a 2025 high of $3,848 at the beginning of the week, before retracing. According to the financier, if it crosses the $4,000 mark, it could trigger a strong price discovery. Beyond corporate adoption, ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S are experiencing a dramatic influx of investor interest. On July 16, these products posted a record $726 million in net inflows, followed by another $533 million on July 22, bringing weekly additions to over $2.1 billion. This surge has driven total AUM past $20 billion, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity capturing the bulk of demand. Could BTC Hit $150K? The crypto entrepreneur also spoke about BTC during his appearance on Squawk Box, saying that it could get to the $150,000 mark this year. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands for $115,324, down 4.2% over the past week but up nearly 9% in the last month. BTC also recently achieved a new all-time high, flying past the $123,000 mark. According to Novogratz, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs stance on interest rates will influence this momentum. He believes any policy shift away from lower rates could challenge BTC‚Äôs trajectory. He points to rising capital expenditures, upcoming tariffs, and China‚Äôs reflation efforts as driving forces behind current interest. With the Trump administration expected to push for lower rates by 2026, Novogratz believes these conditions will continue to support demand for assets like BTC and ETH. Despite the potential for shifts in monetary policy, he remains bullish on both.

2025-07-25T22:01:31,"Two Solana (SOL)-Based Altcoins Get the Nod From Top US-Based Crypto Exchange by Trading Volume Coinbase","A pair of Solana ( SOL )-based altcoins is dipping in price after gaining support from the largest crypto exchange by trading volume in the US. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets says it is adding support for Jito Staked SOL ( JITOSOL ) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Metaplex ( MPLX ). ‚ÄúJito Staked SOL and Metaplex are now live on http://coinbase.com and in the Coinbase iOS and Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.‚Äù News of the support caused both assets to dip as JITOSOL is trading for $217 at time of writing, a 6.8% decrease on the day while MPLX is valued at $0.169, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours. JITOSOL is a liquid staked token (LST) where users can earn extra rewards by staking Solana on the decentralized finance (DeFi) network Jito. Furthermore, according to its official website , the asset not only stays in your crypto wallet and accrues two forms of interest, but it is also liquid, meaning it isn‚Äôt locked up and can be traded on demand. ‚ÄúJitoSOL is a reward-bearing LST that maintains a constant quantity in your wallet. What sets JitoSOL apart is its dual reward system, accruing both staking and MEV rewards. And as rewards accrue over time the JitoSOL/SOL exchange rate increases as well.‚Äù MPLX is the native asset of the Metaplex NFT marketplace, a decentralized platform built on top of Solana that serves as its governance token as well as provides the infrastructure for minting, trading, and managing NFTs.
