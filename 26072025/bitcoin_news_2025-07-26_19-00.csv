Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption has improved and is now on the rise. The rising adoption is beneficial for an asset, as it is directly proportional to a token’s price. But the big question for intrigued market participants still remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? Read our in-depth Algorand Price Prediction 2025 and long-term outlook through 2030 to find out.

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand, the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price of $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to July 18th, ALGO price surged to $0.34, recording a remarkable 110% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. But, BTC went into consolidation, and the altcoin sector faced profit booking that resulted in AVAX pullback to $0.26, which aligns with multi-month resistance that turned into crucial support now. As July is about to conclude, if the $0.26-$0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.34 mark by the end of the month, and if it flips $0.34, then in August $ a 0.50 retest could be imminent. But losing the grip at $0.26-$0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.34 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the remaining second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60, $0.80 mark, and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price on the daily chart, a broader view of the monthly chart data reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways movement, contrasting sharply with the high-strength parabolic growth seen in 2021. This perspective suggests that with the right momentum, ALGO could indeed achieve these higher price levels.

2025-07-26T16:48:35,"$3,348,951 Worth of ‘Gold Paste’ Seized At Airport After Couple Orchestrates Creative Smuggling Technique On Dubai Flight","Airport security has snagged several million dollars in liquefied gold from a couple attempting to smuggle it into India. According to a post on the social media platform X, India’s Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) says it seized 28 kilograms of gold paste – worth roughly $3.34 million at current prices – after they got off their plane from Dubai. The CISF said the gold paste was “ingeniously” concealed on their bodies, and that the seizure sets a new benchmark for pro-active surveillance and profiling. Gold smugglers will often turn their gold into a paste containing non-metallic substances like resin or glue in order to avoid setting off metal detectors which would otherwise easily spot regular coins or bars. The male suspect was reportedly wearing pants, while the female was wearing a salwar suit, a traditional Indian dress. However, security noticed “bulges” around their midsections, drawing suspicion. Speaking to local NDTV , a senior CISF officer said, “The duo, residents of Gujarat, caught the officer’s attention due to their unusual walking pattern and slight bulges around their abdominal area, which did not match the natural body contour… A total of 28 kg of gold paste was found neatly strapped around their midsections and upper torsos – 16 kg on the woman and 12 kg on the man.” Another official investigating the case said the seizure was “likely the biggest gold haul in the history of Surat airport.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-26T16:43:01,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Crash to $111K Imminent for BTC?","Bitcoin’s muted volatility phase continues, with structural support holding firm. The market’s next decisive move will likely be shaped by reactions at the $114,000 and $111,000 support zones. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin continues to consolidate within the narrow $116K–$120K range, marked by low volatility and subdued price action. This sideways movement suggests an ongoing equilibrium between buying and selling pressure, possibly due to capital rotation into the altcoin markets. A key concern is the emergence of a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, indicating a fading of bullish momentum. This divergence increases the likelihood of renewed selling pressure and suggests a possible continuation of the correction phase. If so, a move toward the $111,000 support level becomes probable. Despite this, the broader market structure remains bullish as long as the $111,000 level holds. If this price point acts as a reliable demand zone, an eventual breakout above $120K could resume the larger uptrend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC is forming a bullish flag pattern, a classic consolidation formation within an uptrend. The price has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline acting as dynamic support, currently near the $114K level. As long as this trendline remains intact, the market is likely to continue consolidating inside the flag, which aligns with a healthy correction. However, a breakdown below this ascending support would likely trigger a sharper pullback toward $111K, forming a key liquidity zone. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The latest futures order flow shows a noticeable surge in small-sized positions, a strong indication that retail traders are actively participating in the current price range. This spike reveals a high level of retail engagement, especially within the $116K–$120K consolidation zone. Interestingly, large-scale sell-side activity (represented by green circles), typically associated with institutions or whales, is not present. These major players are not offloading their positions, suggesting that they remain confident in the ongoing bullish trend and do not expect a major reversal just yet. This setup, with retail activity high and smart money quiet, has historically preceded major bullish moves. While the market may seem stagnant, this phase often serves as a cooling-off period before another leg of the upward trend. The lack of panic from whales adds weight to the theory that this is a healthy consolidation, not a trend reversal. Once the current range resolves, a fresh wave of demand may enter the market, likely pushing Bitcoin toward new highs.

The price briefly dipped near the $115,000 support level but has already begun to recover, signaling that bullish momentum remains intact despite recent selling pressure. Market participants appear to be reacting calmly, with strong demand quickly absorbing the dip. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, today’s price movement coincides with a significant increase in open interest across major exchanges. Binance, Bybit, and Gate all recorded sharp spikes in open interest within the last 24 hours, suggesting that traders are positioning aggressively. Notably, these exchanges were among the recipients of large Bitcoin transfers earlier in the day, likely tied to institutional or whale activity. This alignment of price recovery and rising open interest hints at a shift in sentiment. Short-term traders are re-entering the market, while bulls appear ready to defend key levels. As volatility picks up, Bitcoin’s ability to hold and reclaim recent support will determine whether it resumes its upward march or remains range-bound. The coming days could be critical for setting the tone of the next leg in Bitcoin’s price action. Rising Open Interest Signals Growing Volatility According to Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research, over the last 24 hours, open interest surged by approximately $4 billion, indicating that leveraged positions—particularly shorts—have entered the market in large numbers. This spike coincided with significant Bitcoin transfers to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit, which received a substantial portion of today’s large-volume transactions. These developments suggest increased speculative activity as traders anticipate further price movement. The inflow of coins to exchanges, combined with rising open interest, typically signals upcoming volatility. Short sellers appear to be betting on continued downside, but with Bitcoin already recovering from its recent $115,000 dip, this could lead to a short squeeze if momentum shifts back in favor of the bulls. This market shift comes as Ethereum and altcoins show notable strength. Since May, Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin, aided by institutional accumulation and clearer regulatory signals in the US. As ETH leads the altcoin rally, investors are watching closely to see whether capital rotation from BTC into altcoins continues. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $4.1B In ETH In Two Weeks – Details Bitcoin Holds Key Support After Minor Pullback The daily Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a bullish structure despite recent volatility. After briefly consolidating near the $122,000 resistance zone and reaching an all-time high just above that level, the price retraced toward the $115,700–$117,000 support band. This zone, marked by the horizontal yellow range, also aligns closely with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $117,593.23, reinforcing its role as a strong technical support. The overall uptrend that started in early May remains intact, with higher highs and higher lows clearly visible on the chart. Notably, BTC continues to trade well above the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) SMAs, which sit at $112,547.95 and $109,436.38, respectively. These levels serve as deeper support zones if selling pressure intensifies. Volume has increased slightly on red candles, indicating some sell pressure, but there is no sign of panic. As long as BTC holds above the $115,700 level, bulls maintain the advantage. A breakout above $122,000 would signal trend continuation and could open the path to new highs.

This event marks a crucial development in Nigeria’s crypto regulation after the West African giant began to change its hostile approach against the virtual asset industry in 2023. We Will Deal With Stablecoins But On Our Terms: SEC DG According to local media Punch Newspapers , Emomotimi Agama, the Nigerian SEC Director-General (DG), expressed the commission’s readiness to condole and foster stablecoin operations. This announcement came during the DG’s keynote address at the Nigerian Stablecoin Summit in Lagos on Thursday, organized by the African Stablecoin Network. According to Agama, the SEC welcomes all stablecoin businesses that are ready to operate on conditions that protect and empower Nigerian markets. The DG strongly emphasized this message in highlighting the need to balance responsible innovation with regulation. In showing the Commission’s readiness to deal with stablecoin operators, Agama also referenced the recent Investment and Securities Act 2025, which offers provisions in governing the digital assets industry, representing the first legal step in creating a suitable business environment for stablecoins. However, while acknowledging the global trend in actively embracing stablecoins, the SEC boss hinted at potential differences in regulations while explaining the need to implement solutions unique to the Nigerian landscape. Agama said: Africa needs African solutions, regulatory frameworks that reflect our market conditions, demographic realities, and development priorities. Emomotimi Agama has strongly lauded the potential of building a strong stablecoin community in Nigeria, which he says, possesses a digital economy that is “dynamic, youthful, and increasingly decentralised.” He also cites a rising market demand for these dollar-pegged virtual cryptocurrencies from individuals and businesses due to fluctuations in the value of the Nigerian naira. The SEC DG believes stablecoins have a major role in Africa’s financial future, describing the SEC announcement as a critical historical moment. Agama said When the history books document Africa’s financial revolution, today will be remembered as the moment we moved from potential to action Crypto Regulation In Nigeria Over the past three years, Nigerian authorities have shifted from outright restrictions to a framework of regulated acceptance in dealing with the crypto industry. Most notably, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) lifted its two-year ban on cryptocurrency-related transactions in 2023 before introducing a guideline on opening commercial bank accounts for virtual assets service providers (VASP). Meanwhile, the Nigerian SEC, which has previously recognized digital assets as securities, continues to roll out several policy documents on issuance, offering, and custody of cryptocurrency to bring all market players under regulatory oversight. At press time, the global crypto market cap remains valued at $3.83 trillion following a 0.40% gain in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-confirms-readiness-stablecoin-operations/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA","Crypto regulation|Central Bank of Nigeria|Emomotimi Agama crypto regulation|Nigeria|SEC|Stablecoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-26T16:26:19,"BlackRock goes against Wall Street consensus in calls for Fed interest rate cuts","BlackRock is calling for rate cuts. While most of Wall Street wants the Federal Reserve to keep rates steady or deliver minimal easing, BlackRock’s Rick Rieder says the central bank needs to start cutting now. Rieder, who serves as Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, made the case in a Bloomberg TV interview, arguing that interest rates are damaging low-income Americans and stalling broader economic potential. “The service economy is what drives this economy today,” Rieder said. “It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” According to the Bloomberg interview, he believes that since most of the economy is now service-based, it has become resistant to rate-driven slowdowns in goods. That, he says, makes the old way of targeting inflation through aggressive hikes less effective, and more harmful in the wrong places. Rieder explained that today’s interest rates are hitting one part of the economy especially hard: housing . “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing,” he said. And that impact, he explained, is falling on the shoulders of low-income borrowers. “People that borrow today are lower-income and they’re adversely impacted, infected, by where these rates are.” He argued that lowering rates would allow for more housing construction and better affordability. “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation,” Rieder said. Despite the economy performing well on the surface, he sees rate cuts as consistent with managing the inflation outlook. He pointed out that inflation break-evens are currently between 2.5% and 2.75%, while the Fed funds rate could be cut to 3.25% and still stay above that level. “I think we got plenty of room to drop it,” he said. BlackRock bets on AI, crypto, and stablecoins while waiting for Fed to act Rieder said the only long-term path out of the U.S. debt problem is to grow faster than the debt itself. “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt. You got to outgrow it,” he said. He said a combination of GDP growth between 4.5% to 5% and a drop in interest rates to 3% could help, though it would take time. On the tech side, Rieder leaned heavily into artificial intelligence as a future growth engine. “People underestimate how dramatic this is gonna be,” he said. He tied AI, robotics, cloud, software, energy, and cooling into one broad theme of accelerated productivity. “Our world a year or two hence is gonna see things that nobody’s ever seen before,” he said . AI-driven automation will create lower-cost services, improve business efficiency, and change how companies operate entirely. “It doesn’t have to be necessarily the Mag 7,” Rieder added. He believes companies that use data effectively, whether they’re retailers, media platforms, or tech firms, are best positioned. “The companies that utilize data to expand their mode… how they advertise, how they run their business efficiently using software,” are the real winners. Rieder still favors large-cap growth stocks and tech. “I still believe in growth, in technology and equities,” he said. He also supports balancing portfolios with small amounts of gold or crypto. On crypto, Rieder made it clear he owns some personally. He didn’t go into detail on amounts, but said it’s held in “moderate size.” More importantly, he called stablecoins a key part of the future financial system. “Stablecoin, I actually think will be quite helpful,” he said. “It will soak up some of the Treasuries… not a tremendous amount, but some.” He also said stablecoins will help with global dollar use and with tokenized payments and investments. Rieder ended by calling the global crypto adoption rate “extraordinary.” Despite volatility, he sees it as a growing part of the economy that investors will have to deal with, like it or not.

2025-07-26T16:12:26,"Peter Brandt Bullish on Bitcoin, But Warns Gen Z Traders","Peter Brandt, a renowned community trader, has once again expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin’s (BTC) future. He affirms that Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, will play a significant role in the financial world in the future. Brandt believes that Bitcoin will serve as an economic foundation over the coming decades, providing a secure alternative to traditional money. Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin Might Let Down Gen Z Traders However, Brandt, in a post on X , warns Gen Z traders who see crypto as a quick way to get rich. He advises young investors not to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a simple solution for financial problems. Brandt explains that emotional trading, a lack of discipline, and the pursuit of quick gains can lead to economic troubles in the unpredictable cryptocurrency market. While emphasizing the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, Brandt also shared a list of essential books for anyone serious about understanding Bitcoin and crypto trading. These books provide valuable insights into market psychology, risk management, technical analysis, and the basic principles of blockchain technology. It is worth noting that this is not the first time the veteran trader has warned young investors in the cryptocurrency space. Last year, Brandt warned young investors that Bitcoin’s future growth trajectory might not make them rich . He implied that as Bitcoin matures, its growth potential may slow down. Some factors that trigger this include market saturation, increased adoption, or the law of diminishing returns. Is Bitcoin Still a “Road to Financial Glory?” Despite this note of warning, Brandt maintains that Bitcoin is still a “great hedge vs. fiat busts. That is, he still believes Bitcoin can serve as a way to preserve wealth , particularly during economic instability. Brandt’s post suggests that Bitcoin currently serves as a more effective store of value than a tool for rapid wealth accumulation. He, therefore, warned Gen Z not to see Bitcoin as a “road to financial glory” or else they might suffer disappointment. In all, Bitcoin remains the leading digital currency in the market. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $118,180, representing a 2% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . “Invest-and-Forget” Approach for Bitcoin Meanwhile, earlier in the year, Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA Holdings, suggested a straightforward strategy for retail investors: invest in BTC regularly and let it be . In his words, “My recommendation to my kids, for example, is to put a little aside every month in BTC and let it grow over time.” He emphasized that, over a period of two to four years, this method can yield significant returns, noting Bitcoin’s average annual growth of 29% to over 50%. Thiel acknowledges the volatility inherent in Bitcoin compared to traditional financial assets. He remained confident in the cryptocurrency’s potential to outperform over extended periods. Intriguingly, MARA Holdings mirrors its CEO’s bullish stance on Bitcoin .
