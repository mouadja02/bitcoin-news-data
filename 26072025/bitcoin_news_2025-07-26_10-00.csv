Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.15896372 3.48% Market cap $ 187,135,894,266.66 Circulating Supply 59,239,646,627.00 Trading Volume $ 6,869,063,055.7940 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. The recent developments surrounding XRP have sparked optimism, particularly with the potential for increased legal clarity for digital assets. The debut of a spot ETF has raised hopes that other asset managers’ applications for spot XRP ETFs could be approved by the end of the year. On the charts, XRP’s rally resembles a breakout from the upper resistance of a falling wedge pattern. Since the third week of June, XRP has gained nearly 85%, and from the second week of July, it surged over 60%. However, the momentum faced a setback when a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen dumped $200 million worth of XRP in the past ten days, coinciding with XRP nearing local highs. This move led to accusations that Larsen was cashing out at the expense of retail investors, with some claiming that those buying the dip were merely providing exit liquidity. This turmoil triggered a significant profit-taking wave, causing XRP’s price to plummet 19% from its all-time high to $2.95 in just a few days during the fourth week of July. Yet, the price quickly rebounded from $2.95 to $3.08, with many on social media suggesting this was a strategic dip to attract larger investors. Experts are now encouraging buyers to seize this opportunity, believing a more substantial rise is on the horizon. The community sentiment is clear: “The strong will remain, while the weak will fall.” From a technical standpoint, the golden cross between XRP’s 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded, indicating bullish potential. If XRP continues to rise, it could soon retest the $3.40 and $3.66 levels by the end of July or into August. Conversely, if the price fails to hold the $3.00 support, a retest of the $2.60 and $2.40 levels may be on the table. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP AI Price Prediction For August 2025 Platform Low Price Average Price High Price Claude $3.00 – $3.15 $3.50 – $4.00 $7.50 – $8.20 Blackbox $2.50 $3.50 $5.00 Gemini $3.00 – $4.00 $4.50 – $6.00 $6.50 – $8.00+ XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026.

Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00.

The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The altcoins are also well in the green today, with ETH jumping back above $3,700 and SUI marking a notable double-digit surge. BTC Reclaims $117K The primary cryptocurrency was in a consolidation phase since July 14, when it hit a new all-time high of over $123,000. In the following ten days or so, it remained sideways around $118,000, with a few brief attempts for a breakout in each direction. The buyers and sellers managed to maintain equilibrium for a while, but the bears took control on Thursday evening as Galaxy Digital began disposing of massive portions of BTC. In a matter of hours, bitcoin’s price tumbled from over $119,000 to a two-week low at $114,500. After dumping by more than four grand, the bulls finally reemerged and didn’t allow a further breakdown. Just the opposite, BTC bounced off and jumped past $117,000, where it stands as of press time as well. Crypto analysts believe this could be a pivotal moment if it manages to maintain above this level, as it could open the doors for fresh ATHs next week. It’s very clear; if #Bitcoin can hold above $116.8K, then we’ll start to see new highs in the coming week. pic.twitter.com/jC0Gpg9db7 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 26, 2025 Alts in Green The altcoins experienced substantial losses at the end of the business week but have reacted well today, with notable gains.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is becoming aggressively bullish as in the year’s second half, July, a new ATH has been marked, smashing previous all-time highs of $112K . As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode.

With the Federal Reserve hinting at future rate cuts and market enthusiasm at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $115,765.69 and $119,298.17 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since breaking out of its consolidation phase in the last week of June, Bitcoin price has been propelled by whale accumulation, a surge in spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On July 14th, this momentum led Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high of $123,231. However, the excitement was tempered as traders began to take profits, causing the market to pause and recover from its exhaustion. Currently, the RSI has dropped from 75 to 52, nearing the neutral line, indicating a fierce battle between bulls and bears. This suggests that Bitcoin may cool off further and retest the 50-day EMA band, where renewed buying pressure could spark another rally. In the short term, Bitcoin has flipped the $116 level and is now retesting the 20-day EMA band at around $115,000. If it dips below this mark, it could retrace to the $110,000 swing low support zone, with the final line of defense resting at approximately $101,000. On the flip side, if the Bitcoin reverses from $115K then by surpassing the ATH it could eye the psychological milestone of $125,000. If the upward momentum persists, this level could be tested before the month concludes.

Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-26T07:31:07,"Ancient Whale From the Satoshi Era That Transferred 80,000 Bitcoins Sold Them All — The Whale’s Identity May Have Been Revealed","Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant, has put forward a remarkable theory regarding the recent 80,000 Bitcoin transfers. Stating that these BTCs were moved after remaining dormant for 14 years, Ju claimed that the funds first originated from the MyBitcoin wallet service, which collapsed in 2011. Ju made the following statement on social media: The latest transfer of 80,000 BTC, which had lain dormant for 14 years, originally came from wallets hosted by MyBitcoin. These wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin was hacked and collapsed in July 2011. It is highly likely that these BTC belong to either the hacker or the anonymous founder, Tom Williams. Related News: Analytics Firm Issues Warning: Unusual Data Coming in Bitcoin Options - Here's What It Signals Ki Young Ju also noted that these BTCs appear to have been purchased by Galaxy Digital, but she is unsure whether the firm has conducted any forensic analysis. Galaxy Digital, meanwhile, announced that it had completed one of the largest nominal Bitcoin transactions in history. The company completed the sale of over 80,000 Bitcoins on behalf of a client. According to Galaxy, the transaction, currently valued at over $9 billion, was made as part of a legacy planning strategy for a Satoshi-era user who was one of Bitcoin's early investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-26T07:25:10,"Ethereum Price: Is an Epic Pullback Looming Amidst Euphoric Frenzy?","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Is an Epic Pullback Looming Amidst Euphoric Frenzy? The world of cryptocurrency is a whirlwind of innovation, opportunity, and, often, intense emotional swings. Lately, all eyes have been on the remarkable surge in Ethereum price , as ETH has soared to impressive new heights. This rally has certainly sparked widespread excitement, yet seasoned observers and on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment are beginning to raise a cautious flag. Could this period of intense bullishness, described as ‘extreme euphoria,’ actually be signaling an impending short-term correction for Ethereum price ? Understanding the ‘Extreme Euphoria’ in Ethereum Price When we talk about ‘extreme euphoria’ in the context of Ethereum price , we’re primarily referring to a significant surge in social media mentions and overall public sentiment. Cointelegraph, citing Santiment, highlighted that social dominance for ETH has reached levels often associated with market tops. But what exactly does ‘social dominance’ mean, and why is it a warning sign? Social Dominance Explained: This metric tracks the percentage of cryptocurrency-related discussions on social media platforms (like X, Reddit, Telegram) that are focused on a particular asset, in this case, Ethereum. A high social dominance indicates that ETH is a hot topic, capturing a large share of the crypto conversation. The Contrarian Indicator: Historically, periods of overwhelming social euphoria often precede price corrections. When everyone is talking about an asset, and sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, it can suggest that most potential buyers have already entered the market. This leaves fewer new buyers to push the price higher, making the asset vulnerable to profit-taking. A Crowded Trade: High social dominance can also point to a ‘crowded trade,’ meaning a large number of investors are positioned on the same side (long). While this can fuel a rally in the short term, it creates significant downside risk if sentiment shifts, as many investors might rush to exit simultaneously. The recent spike in Ethereum price discussions on social platforms, reaching these ‘euphoric’ levels, serves as a crucial reminder for investors to approach the market with caution, despite the compelling narrative of growth. The ETH/BTC Ratio Surge: A Deeper Dive into Ethereum Price Dynamics Another significant factor contributing to the current market narrative around Ethereum price is its performance relative to Bitcoin. Since early May, the ETH/BTC price ratio has jumped an astounding 70%. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics and investor preference. Relative Strength: The ETH/BTC ratio is a key metric for understanding Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. When this ratio rises, it means Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, often signaling a period where capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins, particularly Ethereum. Altcoin Season Bellwether: A strong ETH/BTC ratio is frequently seen as a precursor or an active sign of an ‘altcoin season,’ where alternative cryptocurrencies experience significant gains. Ethereum, being the second-largest crypto and the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, often leads this charge. Implications for Portfolios: For investors, a rising ETH/BTC ratio suggests that holding Ethereum might be more profitable than holding Bitcoin during certain market phases. However, a sharp, rapid increase can also indicate an overheated market, where speculative fervor drives assets higher unsustainably. While the 70% jump in the ETH/BTC ratio undeniably showcases Ethereum’s recent dominance, it also amplifies the concern about a potentially overextended rally, adding another layer of complexity to the Ethereum price outlook. Are Broader Market Indicators Signaling Caution for Ethereum Price? Despite the warning signs from social sentiment and the ETH/BTC ratio, Santiment also noted a nuanced point: broader market indicators do not yet reflect ‘peak frothiness.’ This suggests that while individual asset sentiment might be high, the overall crypto market might not be at its absolute top, implying that the rally for Ethereum price could still have room to run. But what are these ‘broader market indicators,’ and how do they differ from social sentiment? On-Chain Metrics: These include data points like active addresses, transaction volumes, exchange inflows/outflows, and miner behavior. For instance, if a large amount of ETH is being moved off exchanges into self-custody, it can signal long-term holding intentions, reducing immediate selling pressure. Derivatives Market Data: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts, open interest, and options market data can provide insights into leverage in the system. Extremely high positive funding rates, for example, often indicate an overheated market with excessive bullish leverage. Institutional Flows: Tracking inflows into institutional products like Ethereum ETFs (where available) or Grayscale Ethereum Trust can indicate sustained institutional demand, which typically suggests a more robust and less ‘frothy’ market structure. Market Cap Dominance: Looking at Bitcoin’s dominance (BTC.D) can provide a macro view. If Bitcoin dominance is still relatively high, it might suggest that the overall market isn’t yet in full ‘altcoin frenzy’ mode, which typically characterizes the absolute peak of a bull run. The distinction between asset-specific euphoria and broader market ‘frothiness’ is critical. It implies that while Ethereum price might be facing short-term headwinds due to its own intense hype, the larger crypto ecosystem might still be absorbing capital, potentially offering a buffer against a severe, prolonged downturn for ETH. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Price Investors In a market characterized by such intense swings and mixed signals, how can investors best position themselves regarding the future of Ethereum price ? The key lies in informed decision-making, risk management, and a clear understanding of your investment goals. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, honestly evaluate how much volatility you can stomach. Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are inherently volatile. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification is Key: While Ethereum is a strong asset, putting all your eggs in one basket is rarely advisable. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This strategy, known as DCA, helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations on your overall Ethereum price acquisition cost. Stay Informed, But Avoid FOMO: Keep up-to-date with market news and on-chain analytics, but be wary of succumbing to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during euphoric periods or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during pullbacks. Base your decisions on data and your long-term strategy, not just emotion. Consider Profit-Taking Strategies: If you’ve experienced significant gains in your Ethereum price holdings, it might be prudent to consider taking some profits off the table. This could involve selling a portion of your holdings to secure gains or rebalancing your portfolio. Ultimately, navigating the current landscape of Ethereum price requires a balanced approach, combining an understanding of market psychology with sound investment principles. Historical Precedents: What Past Cycles Tell Us About Ethereum Price History, while not a guarantee of future performance, often rhymes. Looking back at previous crypto market cycles, we can observe patterns that shed light on the current situation for Ethereum price . Periods of ‘extreme euphoria’ are not new; they have consistently marked phases where market sentiment becomes detached from fundamental value, leading to unsustainable rallies. 2017 Bull Run: The ICO boom saw unprecedented levels of public excitement and social media frenzy. Many projects with little substance soared, only to crash dramatically during the subsequent bear market. Ethereum itself experienced massive gains but also significant pullbacks. 2021 Bull Run: The DeFi and NFT explosions brought a new wave of euphoria. While Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthened considerably, the rapid price appreciation, especially in memecoins and speculative NFTs, eventually led to a broad market correction. The Role of Corrections: Corrections are a natural and often healthy part of market cycles. They purge excessive leverage, wash out weak hands, and allow for a reset, paving the way for more sustainable growth in the long term. For Ethereum price , a short-term pullback could provide a healthier foundation for future rallies. These historical patterns underscore the importance of recognizing the signs of overheating, even for fundamentally strong assets like Ethereum. While the underlying technology and ecosystem of Ethereum continue to grow, market sentiment can temporarily override fundamentals, leading to periods of overvaluation. The current buzz around Ethereum price is undeniable, driven by significant rallies and widespread enthusiasm. However, the surge in social dominance to ‘extreme euphoria’ levels, as highlighted by Santiment, serves as a potent reminder of potential short-term volatility. While broader market indicators may not yet signal a complete top, the specific exuberance around ETH warrants caution. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant, manage their risks, and base their decisions on a comprehensive understanding of both sentiment and fundamental data. The crypto market is a marathon, not a sprint, and navigating its peaks and valleys requires a strategic and disciplined approach to secure long-term success in your Ethereum price investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Ethereum Price Q1: What does ‘extreme euphoria’ mean for Ethereum price? A: ‘Extreme euphoria’ for Ethereum price typically refers to a period where social media mentions and public sentiment about ETH reach exceptionally high and overwhelmingly positive levels. Historically, such periods often act as a contrarian indicator, suggesting that the asset might be overvalued in the short term and prone to a price correction as most potential buyers have already entered the market. Q2: Why is the ETH/BTC ratio important for Ethereum price analysis? A: The ETH/BTC ratio measures Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio indicates that Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, often signaling a shift of capital into altcoins. While a strong ETH/BTC ratio is positive, a rapid surge, like the recent 70% jump, can suggest an overheated market for Ethereum price , indicating speculative fervor that might not be sustainable. Q3: What are ‘broader market indicators’ and how do they relate to Ethereum price? A: Broader market indicators encompass a wider range of data points beyond just social sentiment, such as on-chain metrics (e.g., exchange flows, active addresses), derivatives market data (e.g., funding rates, open interest), and institutional investment flows. While Ethereum price might show signs of euphoria, if these broader indicators don’t reflect ‘peak frothiness,’ it suggests the overall crypto market might still have room to grow, potentially cushioning a sharp ETH-specific downturn. Q4: What actionable steps can investors take given the current Ethereum price outlook? A: Given the mixed signals for Ethereum price , investors should consider several actionable steps: assess personal risk tolerance, diversify portfolios, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility, stay informed but avoid emotional decisions (FOMO/FUD), and contemplate profit-taking strategies if significant gains have been realized. Prudent risk management is key. Q5: Have we seen ‘extreme euphoria’ for Ethereum price before? A: Yes, periods of ‘extreme euphoria’ are a recurring theme in cryptocurrency market cycles, including for Ethereum price . Past bull runs (e.g., 2017, 2021) saw similar surges in social excitement and speculative activity, which were often followed by significant market corrections.

However, industry experts now note that these patterns have been fading and new forces are starting to shape the market. Is the 4-Year Cycle Breaking Down? Bitcoin recently broke above its new all-time highs and surged past $123,000. Bitcoin cycles typically last around 1,070 days from the market bottom to the next peak. If history repeats, this bull run could continue until October 20, 2025, which suggests that the cycle isn’t over yet. BITCOIN CYCLE ISN'T OVER Each Bitcoin cycle has lasted approximately 1,070 days from the bottom of the bear market to the bull market peak. If this trend continues, the bull market is expected to last until October 20, 2025. pic.twitter.com/6tLHf8wGwz — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 26, 2025 Long-Term Forces Will Outpower the 4-Year Cycle Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan , is one of those who think that the classic four-year crypto cycle is breaking down. He notes that Bitcoin halvings matter less each time. Interest rates that were once a headwind are now helping crypto. With clear regulations in place and more institutional players, major blowups are now less likely. ETF adoption has just begun, and he believes that it is a 5-10 year trend. Institutional money is slowly entering, with pensions, endowments, and national platforms now considering crypto. Wall Street is finally investing seriously in crypto, and he expects that it will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. Big names like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are already exploring crypto products. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year,” he said. The Biggest Risk? However, he notes that “the biggest emergent cyclical-style risk” is the rise of Treasury companies. In the last month alone, 22 public companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing the total to 160. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju had also said that the old Bitcoin cycle is over. He says the pattern of predicting markets by tracking whale buys and retail FOMO no longer fits. This time, old whales are selling to new long-term holders, not retail. BTC Still On Track But some have stuck by the 4-year cycle. Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes Bitcoin is still closely tracking its four-year cycle, pointing to its recent all-time highs. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the cycle still exists but is weaker. With more stable money flowing in, the wild crashes may turn into smaller dips. Bitcoin is around 975 days into its current cycle, and past cycles peaked just after 1,060 days. This shows that a possible top may occur by mid-October. On-chain signs also support the idea of a final parabolic run, potentially pushing BTC toward $250,000. Pi Cycle Top Is Speeding Up While there are claims that this cycle is different, similar optimism was seen in the past cycles, and the classic four-year pattern held each time. History still points to a Bitcoin peak in late 2025.

2025-07-26T07:04:50,"US Lawmakers Hit JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America Boss Brian Moynihan With Subpoenas Over Role in Tesla Supplier’s IPO: Report","US lawmakers are reportedly subpoenaing the heads of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America for their roles in the initial public offering (IPO) of a global Chinese battery supplier. The lawmakers are demanding JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan produce documents related to the Hong Kong listing of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which supplies batteries to Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers, reports the Wall Street Journal. The politicians making the demands of the two US banks serve on the House of Representatives’ Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which focuses on the national security threat posed by China. In April, the congressional committee urged JPMorgan and Bank of America to cease their involvement in CATL’s listing since the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” and the committee warned of “serious regulatory, financial, and reputational risks” if they did not. Despite the warning, JPMorgan and Bank of America helped underwrite CATL’s IPO. Says Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), the committee chair, in the subpoena, “CATL’s industry-leading role in battery manufacturing – a sector explicitly targeted by China’s state-driven military-civil fusion policy – poses significant US investor and national security risks.” The committee says in its subpoenas that the banks failed to produce previously requested information on the IPO matter. Meanwhile, Dimon defended underwriting CATL’s IPO in a May interview on Bloomberg TV. “We and other investment banks did a lot of due diligence around all the issues that people raised. If we thought it was wrong, we wouldn’t do it.” Meanwhile, a Bank of America spokesman says the bank will continue to work with the committee. Contemporary Amperex Technology says in its public documents that it believes the DOD incorrectly added it to the list and is “engaging with DOD to address the false designation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
