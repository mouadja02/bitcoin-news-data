The company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) model. The project aims to legitimize Toncoin ownership via public markets. The Ton Foundation and investment firm Kingsway Capital Partners are working to launch a treasury company, according to Bloomberg. The initiative will focus on custodial services for Toncoin, with an initial investment target of $400 million. According to informed sources, the company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) structure, in which a public company issues shares to a select group of private investors. One of the investors will be Kingsway, headed by Manuel Stotz, who also serves as the current president of the Ton Foundation. Neither Stotz nor representatives from the foundation commented at the time of publication. The project is receiving financial backing from Cohen & Co, which previously helped organize a $1.5 billion structure linked to Ethereum. Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading company in establishing public crypto holdings, has also shown interest in the project. Increased interest in such initiatives is due to the success of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), founded by Michael Saylor, which invested heavily in Bitcoin and saw its shares jump over 3,400% in five years. More than 100 entities have since developed models to own crypto assets via the stock market. The new Ton Foundation project aims to follow this model by concentrating assets in Toncoin for institutional investment. Although TON is formally separate from Telegram, its price remains sensitive to news about the messaging platform and its founder, Pavel Durov. At the time of publication, Toncoin is ranked 21st among crypto assets by market capitalization, at $7.7 billion, having declined nearly 40% since the start of the year while Bitcoin has surged alongside Telegram’s continued expansion. Experts believe the project could strengthen Toncoin’s institutional adoption and open a new channel for token investment in public markets, particularly in the US, where the fund is expanding its presence.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10204/ton-foundation-and-kingsway-plan-400-m-pipe-structure-to-boost-toncoin-s-institutional-adoption,"MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTC|TREASURY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-25T23:30:04,"Analyst Forecasts $20 to $30 XRP, But There’s A Catch","A prominent commentator within the XRP community has reiterated his expectation for a significant price surge, predicting that XRP could peak between $20 and $30 in the current cycle. However, he also anticipates a sharp market correction following such a rally, warning investors to prepare accordingly. XRP Price Outlook and Cycle Top Projections Zach Rector, a well-known figure in the XRP space, continues to maintain a bullish outlook, stating that XRP has the potential to rise dramatically in the ongoing market cycle. According to Rector, a price top ranging from $20 to $30 is plausible . Despite this optimistic target, he cautioned that a major pullback could follow once XRP reaches those levels. Rector’s position is based on long-standing market behavior. He acknowledges that although some market dynamics have evolved, the core investor psychology, particularly the tendency to take profits during peaks, remains unchanged. He believes this will likely lead to a correction of up to 50% after XRP reaches its projected high. In follow-up remarks, Rector elaborated that while the traditional four-year crypto cycle may not apply as rigidly as it once did, investor behavior still drives market volatility. He emphasized that understanding these emotional responses is essential for portfolio risk management. The 4 year crypto cycles have been disrupted but people are still going to take profits. Which is why I still believe after a $20-$30 XRP top we will see atleast a 50% correction. Not encouraging folks to trade this move but instead, just making sure you are ready to stomach that… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 22, 2025 Views Among Analysts Not everyone in the XRP community agrees with Rector’s outlook. Johnny Utah, another well-known XRP proponent, challenged the idea that a major correction is inevitable. He argued that the current market is fundamentally different due to increased regulatory clarity, expanding real-world adoption, and rising institutional interest, particularly through financial instruments like ETFs . Utah’s viewpoint mirrors that of Michael Saylor, an advocate for Bitcoin and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, who recently suggested that Bitcoin may not experience a substantial correction until it reaches much higher valuations. Utah believes the same may hold for XRP, suggesting that the traditional correction phase could be bypassed due to these new market conditions. While Rector acknowledged these changing factors, he remained firm in his prediction, emphasizing that global liquidity cycles still influence market movements regardless of macroeconomic developments or regulatory advancements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Cycle Top Forecasts Several other analysts have issued optimistic projections for XRP’s potential peak. Tony Severino anticipates a rapid rise to $13, citing technical breakout patterns and referencing the pace of XRP’s movement in previous bull markets. He believes this upward move could occur within a matter of weeks. Market analyst CasiTrades initially set a near-term target range of $6.50 to $8 for July. However, if the current market momentum continues, she believes XRP could reach as high as $26 before the end of the year. Another analyst, EGRAG, analyzed historical data and predicted a likely average peak around $20. He also noted that if XRP follows its 2017 trajectory, the price could extend to as much as $33. His overall forecast places the likely range for a cycle top between $7 and $21. Meanwhile, Ripple Van Wickle estimates that XRP could reach approximately $14 if Bitcoin climbs to $140,000. In a similar vein, Armando Pantoja expects XRP to achieve a maximum value of $25 over the next two years . He also dismissed common concerns about the asset’s market capitalization becoming a limiting factor. While many analysts agree on a bullish outlook for XRP, opinions diverge on how the asset will behave after reaching its peak. Some believe the market will follow familiar correction patterns, while others argue that structural changes in the crypto space may lead to a new market dynamic. As the debate continues, investors are advised to stay informed and manage expectations amid developing conditions.

2025-07-25T23:24:00,"Saylor’s Strategy Expands Stretch Shares Amid Surging Investor Demand","Saylor announced an increase in the new STRC share offering from $500 million to $2.8 billion. The rise was driven by strong investor demand, as the shares offer a 9% annual dividend. These preferred shares have higher payout priority than regular shares. Bitcoin enthusiast and co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Michael Saylor, has announced an increase in the offering of preferred shares from $500 million to $2.8 billion, citing strong investor demand, according to Bloomberg . The new shares, named Stretch (STRC), offer a 9% annual dividend and have no fixed maturity date, an uncommon feature even among complex exchange-traded instruments. The publication highlighted this move as further proof of Saylor’s unique strategy: transforming a former IT company into a global Bitcoin treasury giant. Strategy initially announced the issuance of STRC shares to raise $500 million for additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite the complexity of the company’s capital structure and rising risks, there has been overwhelming demand for the new issue. Shares are being sold at a discounted price of $90 per share, compared to the nominal $100—a move designed to attract even more investors, especially among Saylor’s retail following. In recent years, Strategy has introduced several innovative financial instruments, including other share types such as Strike, Stride, and Strife, which have proven popular with investors. According to a person familiar with the deal, the new Stretch shares rank above regular common shares in the capital structure but remain subordinate to convertible bonds. The company can adjust the dividend monthly to keep the market price near $100, offering price flexibility and trust—underscoring Strategy’s unconventional approach to corporate finance. “This is not the first example of financial engineering by Strategy. If a company is valued above its fundamental value, it is a good opportunity to raise capital,” said Campbell Harvey, professor of economics at Duke University. Overall, Strategy’s shares have risen 43% year-to-date. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 607,770 BTC, valued at over $70 billion at the time of writing. Saylor continues to inspire other public companies to pursue similar crypto treasury strategies. Notably, private and public companies worldwide have accumulated a total of 1.18 million BTC.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10203/saylor-s-strategy-expands-stretch-shares-amid-surging-investor-demand,"BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-25T23:10:21,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 25 July – XRP, Pepe, Shiba Inu","Crypto progenitor Bitcoin’s historic move to an unprecedented price high of $122,838 last Monday reignited strong bullish sentiment among traders. Although the asset has since retreated by 5.7%, optimism remains high for another potential breakout. The rapid ascent in Bitcoin’s value has simultaneously propelled major altcoins and many of the best meme coins upwards. Tokens such as XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have all marked fresh all-time highs within the last year, reinforcing confidence in a broader market expansion. Currently, the total crypto market cap hovers just below the $4 trillion mark. A slight market-wide correction of 5.3% over the past day indicates a stabilisation phase as prices consolidate after this powerful upswing. With expectations of a significant bull run mounting, investors are turning their focus towards digital assets with the potential to surpass previous price peaks. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Leader Reaches New Price Records Ripple’s XRP continues to cement itself as a key bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchain networks. On July 18, XRP climbed to a fresh record of $3.65, overtaking its former 2018 high of $3.40. XRP trades around $3.11, marking a 14.3% decline from its peak, suggesting it is entering a correction period. Nonetheless, recent developments keep traders hopeful for renewed upward movement. With its lightning-fast settlement times, negligible fees, and frictionless cross-border transacting sans intermediaries, XRP has attracted considerable institutional adoption, including from the United Nations. Following four years of litigation, Ripple secured a major victory in 2023 when a U.S. court determined that XRP’s retail sales were not securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC closed its case, ending years of regulatory uncertainty and solidifying XRP’s market standing. This clarity has driven substantial capital inflows into XRP, resulting in a price surge of over 413% in the last 365 days, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 81% increase over the year. XRP’s RSI dipped to 60 from Monday’s overheated level of 86, indicating growing selling momentum. After a remarkable 44% rally over the past month – significantly outperforming Bitcoin’s 9% rise – traders are now realising their profits and will likely continue doing so over the weekend, depreciating the price and providing a buy-in opportunity. Over the past 7 days, XRP declined by 10% and may continue easing until its RSI reaches a neutral 50 and its price aligns with its 30-day moving average. Further losses are likely to be minimal, since XRP enjoys strong psychological support near its previous resistance level at $3. Between late last year and early April, XRP formed a bullish flag pattern, a structure often preceding strong upward moves, implying that a push towards $4 could materialise by autumn. Pepe ($PEPE): The Biggest Frog in Crypto Eyes New Price Highs In less than two years, Pepe ($PEPE) rose to become one of the top three meme coins, leveraging its cultural relevance to build substantial market dominance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic frog character, Pepe has delivered impressive returns to early holders, reaching a market cap over $5.1 billion. Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe has inspired countless copycats, yet none have managed to match its momentum. The token’s profile skyrocketed further when X CEO Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed avatar. Currently trading around $0.00001221, Pepe has gained 23% in the past month. Despite this, it remains 56.4% below its late-2024 historic peak of $0.00002803. Earlier this year, Pepe charted a falling wedge formation, a technical setup often preceding upward breakouts. With its RSI at 52 and downtrending, a selloff is ensuing which could discount the popular meme coin further over the weekend, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to buy in. While crypto’s broader $3.9 trillion market dipped 5.3%, Pepe has held the fort with only a 2% decline, mirroring Bitcoin and reflecting the fact that larger market cap meme coins can often retain value more like traditional cryptocurrencies as the market grows. Pepe enthusiasts remain hopeful that favourable crypto market conditions and geopolitical stability will ignite another surge before summer concludes. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Ethereum-Based Dogecoin Challenger Could Triple in Price Since launching in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme cryptocurrency after Dogecoin, with a market cap stretching to nearly $8 billion. SHIB has slipped 0.3% in the past 24 hours and is now trading near $0.00001347. Given the fact that crypto’s wider $79 billion meme coin market dipped 4.4% in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s nominal decline highlights its robustness and resillience as a meme coin. The token remains well-positioned for a potential major rally. Recent chart patterns highlight two bullish formations – a descending wedge from November to March and a bullish flag since mid-May – both of which imply continued upward momentum. Should SHIB break past its key resistance at $0.000022 with ongoing market optimism, analysts expect it could rise above $0.00003 before the end of summer. Some forecasts suggest it might even reach between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by year-end if the industry enters a bull market. Unlike most meme tokens, Shiba Inu offers real-world utility via Shibarium, its Ethereum-based Layer-2 network designed to reduce fees, enhance transaction speeds, and improve scalability and privacy. Snorter ($SNORT): Low Price Presale for a Meme Coin and Advanced Crypto Trading Bot Hybrid Identifying promising early-stage projects is critical to maximising crypto returns. While dominant altcoins continue their momentum, emerging tokens still present lucrative opportunities. One such rising project is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid trading bot and meme coin built on Solana, with future cross-chain integrations planned.
