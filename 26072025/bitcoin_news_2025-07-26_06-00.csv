2025-07-26T03:40:07,"Founders Must Be the Signal Amid Web 3.0 Noise","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Recycled buzzwords and hashtags are not enough in the modern Web 3.0 market. If you want to break through in today’s Web 3.0 space, the only way to do that is by creating a monopoly in something consumers want. Very few times has this been done in blockchain. Bitcoin stands as a new asset class, while Ethereum has proven viable for creating mainly NFTs (non-fungible tokens). There is a class of blockchain firms serving traditional financial markets as well as experimenting with stablecoins, RWAs (real-world assets) and more. And while these innovations may make a global impact, they will be dominated by a few players. That is becoming clearer, especially as Web 3.0 takes a backseat to AI. At this point in Web 3.0’s evolution, nobody cares about your whitepaper, roadmap, tokenomics or governance model. It’s no longer 2016. You’re not going to build the next unicorn through hashtags and recycled ideas. Your minute on-chain metrics are meaningless in the grand scheme of all things crypto. All it shows is a lack of adoption and a lack of product market fit, or in other words, value. As a Web 3.0 founder, your survival depends on the uniqueness of your project. You must understand and clearly explain what makes both you and your project not just special but truly one-of-a-kind. Your individuality, as well as that of your company, is your biggest strength. Remember this important truth. The best way to make your project unique entails carving out a monopoly in a niche that solves a big problem. If you find yourself leaning into jargon, perhaps your idea serves no purpose. Perhaps not even you know what it is you are attempting to do. It could be merely that the timing is wrong. Either way, your project must have tangible benefits for consumers and deliver it at least 10 times better than the next best. Ask yourself this question: Is your company story just a rehash of the same old buzzwords Web 3.0 has been throwing around now for more than a decade? If so, you might find resistance gaining traction as you share your story on X and LinkedIn. People have heard it all before. Are you highlighting the correct parts of your expertise and real-world experience? Are your product launches and milestones solving problems for consumers, or are they announcements for the sake of announcements? Avoid those. If your consumer can’t experience an announcement for themselves, don’t bother with the public relations aspect. Save that for when you have something that can improve people’s lives. While you are free to publish insights and case studies on your project, they should be hyper-focused on the unique aspects of your project. Don’t write whitepapers that are not focused on your core strengths and your mission. What does your team do better than any other team in the Web 3.0 space? All of your team’s energy should go towards this strength. Generally speaking, avoid side quests in business. Many founders grow bored with their initial vision, start a side quest, get spread too thin and run out of business. Stay focused on building a monopoly within Web 3.0. Many Web 3.0 companies put too much energy into incestuous partnerships with other Web 3.0 companies, with minimal innovation. Instead, you must look towards large corporations for partnerships that will impact your business in the way you want. Instead of focusing on partnerships with Web 3.0 companies, focus on partnerships with companies outside the space, like from the red-hot AI industry. These are the partnerships you should be announcing on social media, not partnerships with other early-stage Web 3.0 companies. This doesn’t mean you should not attend hackathons and Web 3.0 conferences, but perhaps the purpose there will be to tap into consumers, not partners. When you do speak at conferences, do you offer a unique perspective compared with the rest of the speakers and panelists, or are you repeating views of the industry that have been flogged to death already? Again, you must consider what makes your view or work in the industry unique and lean into that and only that. When you speak before an audience, take risks. Make your wildest claims, assuming they’re backed by logic and reason. Instead of posting into the void on social media – or cross-promoting projects for joint marketing campaigns, AMAs (ask me anything) and more – reach out to the largest technology journals in the world, including Reuters, Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, TechCrunch and others. Reach out to the largest publications in your region. You may not hear back, but these are the publications with the readers you want to know your name. Offer them your insights on timely technology news stories. Don’t chase every opportunity. Focus on the big pieces of your empire – that is, big product shipments, behemoth partnerships and mainstream press. One deal with a high-impact venture capital firm, technology company or protocol can be worth 10,000 small ones. It’s similar for constant exposure in the mainstream compared to industry publications. Building a monopoly is not about testing pitches – it’s about providing value. If the market accepts you, the venture capitalists will surely follow. Web 3.0 projects have to move beyond partnering with other niche Web 3.0 projects. Hype-driven companies are no longer making a splash in Web 3.0. Founders must be unique, and so too must their projects. Crypto bubbles are not creating viable startups anymore. The Web 3.0 projects of today are those solving real problems and showing tangible results. Most past the buzzwords and tiny wins. Build what matters – on ly then will the Web 3.0 market and beyond take notice. Archer Wolfe is the CEO and founder of 1stimpression.com , a premium personal branding agency based out of Hong Kong.

With rising uncertainty in major economies due to various political and macroeconomic conditions, BTC remains a “safer” alternative, at least for now. Another Player in The Game An AI-focused firm headquartered in Japan, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Quantum Solutions Co., is the latest addition to public companies that have adopted the Bitcoin treasury model. In the shared press release, it outlined an initial plan to raise $10 million (¥1.48 billion) for purchasing the asset, with the ultimate goal of accumulating a maximum of 3,000 BTC over the next 12 months. The board of directors meeting had decreed that a subsidiary of the enterprise would launch a new business focused on crypto investments. The company is currently assessing how the investment can potentially impact its finances for the fiscal year ending in February 2026, so the exact method of acquiring the capital has not been decided yet. The firm further stated in the news release: Amidst ongoing yen depreciation and increasing international financial uncertainty, the investment and holding of Bitcoin are gaining importance among global listed companies and institutional investors as a means of diversifying assets, mitigating currency risks, and hedging against inflation. The investment business will be promoted under a few key policies: Purchase and holding of Bitcoin for long-term value Phases of implementation will be in place for the acquisition volume and holding ratio, with constant monitoring Countermeasures for price fluctuation risk and cybersecurity, encompassing a risk management strategy Economic Conditions in Japan and The Trade Deal The shift in sentiment and adoption of Bitcoin by numerous companies comes at a time of financial instability and a crashing bond market in Japan.

The agreement is touted to restore American industrial power, as Japan is directed to invest $550 billion to revitalize several key industries in the United States, including energy production, semiconductor manufacturing, mineral mining, and others. The US will retain 90% of the profits from this investment.

2025-07-26T03:25:10,"Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Decoding the Dramatic 24-Hour Market Shake-Up","BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Decoding the Dramatic 24-Hour Market Shake-Up The cryptocurrency market is a realm of exhilarating highs and sudden, gut-wrenching lows. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of derivatives, particularly with crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Over the past 24 hours, the digital asset landscape witnessed a significant shake-up, with hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions wiped out. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks involved in trading perpetual futures. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these numbers truly mean for traders and the broader market. What Exactly are Crypto Perpetual Futures, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the recent liquidation figures, it’s crucial to grasp the mechanics of crypto perpetual futures . Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This unique feature allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are incredibly popular because they offer: High Leverage: Traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. 24/7 Trading: Mirroring the underlying crypto market, perpetual futures trade around the clock. Price Discovery: Their continuous nature makes them key instruments for price discovery in the crypto ecosystem. However, with great power comes great responsibility – and significant risk. The ability to amplify gains also means the potential to amplify losses, making understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation paramount. Decoding Liquidation: The Trader’s Nightmare So, what exactly is “liquidation” in the context of crypto perpetual futures liquidation ? Simply put, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to a failure to meet margin requirements. When the market moves against a trader’s position, and their margin balance falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange automatically liquidates the position to prevent further losses to the trader and the exchange itself. This often happens rapidly and can result in the loss of the entire initial margin. Key factors leading to liquidation include: Volatile Price Swings: Sudden, sharp movements in the underlying asset’s price. High Leverage: The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to trigger liquidation. Insufficient Margin: Not having enough collateral to cover potential losses. The term “long liquidation” means that positions betting on price increases (longs) were closed out, typically because the price fell. Conversely, “short liquidation” occurs when prices rise, forcing positions betting on price decreases (shorts) to close. The Dramatic 24-Hour Breakdown: Who Got Hit and Why? The past 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation impacting major assets. Here’s a closer look at the data: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (USD) Percentage Long Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $147.42 million 79.09% Ethereum (ETH) $106.23 million 53.93% Solana (SOL) $28.21 million 65.55% This data reveals a clear trend: a significant majority of the liquidated positions were “longs.” This indicates a prevailing downward price movement across these assets that caught many bullish traders off guard. For Bitcoin, nearly 80% of the liquidated value came from long positions, suggesting a strong price correction or bearish momentum that overwhelmed leveraged BTC longs. Ethereum also saw substantial long liquidations, though slightly less pronounced than BTC, while Solana experienced considerable long pressure as well. Such concentrated long liquidations can create a “cascade effect.” As one position is liquidated, it adds selling pressure to the market, which can then trigger more liquidations, leading to further price drops. This domino effect is a critical aspect of understanding large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Why Do These Liquidation Numbers Matter to You? Beyond the raw figures, understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation data offers invaluable insights for all market participants, not just those actively trading derivatives: Market Sentiment Indicator: High long liquidations often signal bearish sentiment or a market correction. Conversely, high short liquidations can precede a rally. Volatility Gauge: Large liquidation sums highlight periods of extreme market volatility, indicating increased risk. Understanding Market Structure: It reveals where significant leverage is concentrated and thus where potential vulnerabilities lie. Risk Management Lessons: For traders, it’s a stark reminder of the importance of prudent risk management and avoiding excessive leverage. These events underscore the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. A major liquidation event in one asset can send ripples across the entire market, influencing spot prices and overall sentiment. Navigating the Perils: Challenges of Trading Perpetual Futures While the allure of high returns through leverage is strong, the challenges associated with trading crypto perpetual futures are equally potent. The primary hurdles include: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Small price movements, when magnified by leverage, can quickly erode capital. Funding Rates: Perpetual futures contracts involve “funding rates” – periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions to keep the contract price pegged to the spot price. These rates can eat into profits or add to costs, especially during prolonged periods. Emotional Trading: The rapid swings and the fear of liquidation can lead to impulsive decisions, often resulting in poor trading outcomes. Technical Complexity: Understanding margin, leverage, funding rates, and order types requires a certain level of technical proficiency. Ignoring these challenges is akin to sailing into a storm without a compass. A comprehensive understanding of the risks is the first step towards successful navigation in the derivatives market. Mastering Risk: Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation For those venturing into or already participating in the world of crypto perpetual futures , mitigating the risk of liquidation is paramount. Here are actionable strategies: Prudent Leverage Management: This is arguably the most critical step. Avoid maxing out your leverage. Use lower leverage ratios, especially when starting out or during highly volatile periods. A 2x or 3x leverage can still amplify gains without putting your entire capital at immediate risk. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. This is your primary defense against sudden adverse price movements and cascading liquidations. Maintain Adequate Margin: Always ensure you have sufficient collateral in your margin account. Actively monitor your margin health and be prepared to add more funds (margin call) if your position is nearing liquidation. Diversify Your Portfolio: While specific to spot trading, the principle applies. Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged positions on a single asset. Stay Informed and Analyze Market Trends: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. Understanding the broader market sentiment and potential catalysts can help you anticipate significant price movements. Practice with Demo Accounts: Many exchanges offer demo or paper trading accounts. Utilize these to practice your strategies and get comfortable with the platform without risking real capital. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all losses, but to manage them effectively so that one bad trade doesn’t wipe out your entire trading capital. Learning from past crypto perpetual futures liquidation events is a powerful tool for future success. Actionable Insights from the Recent Liquidation Wave The recent 24-hour liquidation data offers clear takeaways for traders: Beware of Over-Leveraged Longs: When market sentiment is already fragile or showing signs of weakness, going heavily long with high leverage can be extremely risky. The high percentage of long liquidations in BTC, ETH, and SOL serves as a strong warning. Market Reversals Can Be Swift: Even seemingly stable assets can experience rapid downward movements, triggering widespread liquidations. Always be prepared for unexpected volatility. Opportunity for Astute Traders: While liquidations are painful for some, they can present opportunities for others. Periods of high volatility and price discovery often create entry points for traders with a well-defined strategy and strong risk management. By studying these patterns, traders can refine their strategies, adjust their risk exposure, and potentially capitalize on future market movements. The data from crypto perpetual futures liquidation is a powerful educational tool. Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Perpetual Futures The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While perpetual futures offer incredible opportunities for magnified gains, they come hand-in-hand with magnified risks. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation, recognizing the patterns in the data, and rigorously applying sound risk management strategies are not just recommendations—they are necessities for survival and success in this high-stakes arena. By learning from past market shake-ups, traders can better position themselves to navigate future volatility and make more informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their margin balance falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement. This is typically triggered by adverse price movements against the trader’s position, especially when high leverage is used. 2. How can traders avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Traders can minimize liquidation risk by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and actively monitoring market conditions. Prudent risk management is key. 3. What’s the difference between long and short liquidation? Long liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price increase (a ‘long’ position) is forced to close their position because the price of the asset falls significantly. Short liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price decrease (a ‘short’ position) is forced to close because the price of the asset rises significantly. 4. Does crypto perpetual futures liquidation impact the spot market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can impact the spot market. When positions are liquidated, exchanges often sell the underlying assets to cover losses, adding selling pressure to the spot market and potentially causing further price drops, creating a cascading effect. 5. Are perpetual futures suitable for beginners? Generally, perpetual futures are considered high-risk instruments due to leverage and volatility. They are often not recommended for beginners without a solid understanding of market mechanics, risk management, and trading strategies. Starting with spot trading or demo accounts is advisable. 6. What is a funding rate in perpetual futures? A funding rate is a small, periodic payment exchanged between long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts. It helps to keep the contract’s price anchored to the spot price of the underlying asset. If the funding rate is positive, longs pay shorts; if negative, shorts pay longs.
