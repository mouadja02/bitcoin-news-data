2025-05-20T13:00:22.000Z,"Strategy Buys Another 7,390 Bitcoin: How Much Profit Is The Firm Holding Now?","Strategy has just announced its brand new Bitcoin purchase. Here’s how the profit-loss situation of the firm’s holdings looks now. Strategy Has Made A New Bitcoin Acquisition Worth $764 Million In a new post on X, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has shared the announcement related to the latest Bitcoin purchase by the company. With this new buy, the firm has added another 7,390 BTC to its holdings. These tokens were purchased at a price of about $103,498 per coin or approximately $764.9 million in total. This is the third acquisition that the company has made in this month of May and it’s far larger than the $180 million first buy, but significantly falls behind the $1.34 billion second purchase. Following this acquisition, Strategy now holds about 576,230 BTC. The company has spent a total of $40.18 billion on its BTC purchases, which comes down to about $69,726 per coin. This value is clearly significant under the current spot price, so the firm’s holdings would be in notable profit. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared a chart in an X post that shows exactly how much profit Strategy is in at the moment. As displayed in the above graph, Strategy has naturally seen its unrealized gain spike alongside the latest surge in the cryptocurrency’s price. The firm’s Bitcoin stack is now sitting on a whopping $21.1 billion in profit. From the chart, it’s visible that the company’s holdings have remained in the green since late 2023, being unshaken by any volatility that BTC has faced during the past year. Naturally, if the current BTC rally is going to last, then Strategy should maintain its greenness in the near term. As for whether the run can actually sustain, an indicator that can provide hints about it is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As analyst Ali Martinez has explained in an X post , the daily value of the metric has surged into the overbought territory recently. The RSI is a metric that basically measures the speed and magnitude of the changes happening in any asset’s price over a given period. In the current case, the period is the 14-day one. When the indicator’s value is greater than 70, it can be a sign that Bitcoin is becoming overpriced. On the other hand, it being under 30 implies underbought conditions. As is apparent from the chart, the Bitcoin RSI fell out of the overbought region earlier, but now, it has made a return to it. As such, if the indicator is anything to go by, it’s possible that BTC could encounter turbulence in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone through a rollercoaster over the past day with its price witnessing sharp swings in either direction, with the latest one taking it to $105,200.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-buys-another-7390-bitcoin-much-profit-firm/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin profit|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T12:52:33.000Z,"5 Bullish and 2 Bearish Indicators for Bitcoin as BTC Price Approaches ATH Levels","Just a month and a half ago, this article would have made no sense when BTC’s price tumbled below $75,000 and the main speculations within the community turned on whether the bull run had abruptly ended. Yesterday, bitcoin’s price stood at $30,000 higher, and it came just 2% away from breaking its all-time high from January. It sits slightly lower now, but there’s something in the air that suggests a new peak is coming. Let’s see what on-chain data and some technical indicators will say about that. The Bull Case We begin with large accumulations. After all, prices tend to rise if there’s more buying momentum, right? Lookonchain listed a number of whales that have gone on an accumulation spree in the past few days, purchasing in total over $250 million worth of BTC. Many whales are accumulating $BTC ! bc1qcp withdrew another 1,350 $BTC ($141.91M) from #Binance 8 hours ago and currently holds 20,723 $BTC ($2.19B). bc1qpu (linked to Abraxas Capital) withdrew 675 $BTC ($71.03M) from #Kraken 7 hours ago and currently holds 1,797 $BTC ($190.11M). A… pic.twitter.com/Jccvs4xhvK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 20, 2025 The accumulation group is typically led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin didn’t disappoint this week. On Monday, the NASDAQ-listed company announced the latest purchase of BTC, worth three-quarters of a billion. Metaplanet also joined the pack by acquiring over 1,000 BTC for $104 million. In the same context, it’s also worth exploring the ETF inflows, which have been in the green for most of the past month. In fact, there have been only four red examples since April 14 out of 25 trading days. According to data from Farside, the value of net inflows has surged past $3.3 billion since May 1. Finishing off the accumulations with data from Glassnode, which reads that (almost) all sorts of BTC wallets have been buying recently – it’s not just whales and corporations. Accumulation is now visible across nearly the entire wallet spectrum. Even $BTC holders have flipped from distribution to light accumulation (~0.55), joining larger cohorts like 100–1K (~0.9) and 1K–10K #BTC (~0.85). Only 1–10 #BTC remain net sellers. pic.twitter.com/C4C9ZLlwNs — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 The fifth bullish signal for bitcoin comes from a slightly different perspective, as the overall market sentiment has switched to more positive ground. This is evident from the growing number of BTC leaving exchanges and the MVRV ratio, which is far from the peak levels. The Bearish Side When there are bulls, there have to be some bears, right? Well, their narrative receives support from the daily RSI, which has gone into an overbought territory, according to data shared by Ali Martinez. #Bitcoin $BTC is currently trading in overbought territory, according to the daily RSI; a potential signal for short-term caution. pic.twitter.com/frK8sYUjyX — Ali (@ali_charts) May 19, 2025 The popular analyst shared another worrying sign for BTC’s future price movements as miners, the backbone of the world’s largest blockchain network, have gone on a selling spree in the past day or so, disposing of over $250 million worth of the asset.

Built on Avalanche, Fusion features a two-layer architecture that includes composers, customizable layer-1 networks and modules, which offer plug-and-play services like compute, identity and data oracles. The team said this approach would be the answer for mainstream adoption, as they attempt to deliver “outcome-driven, domain-specific” blockchain-based economies. “In order to achieve widespread adoption, our industry needs to shift from selling blockspace to delivering business value,” a Fusion spokesperson told Cointelegraph. They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes. Fusion expects traction in composer and module development The Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years. “Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. Fusion’s architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added. “Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche’s position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value. Related: Indonesia’s DigiAsia shares pop 90% on plan to raise $100M to buy Bitcoin $100 million fund to come from existing Avalanche programs The project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs. According to Fusion’s announcement, the funds will come from Avalanche’s Multiverse, an incentive program to accelerate the adoption of Avalanche subnets, and Retro9000, a grant program that rewards developers who build infrastructure and tools. Fusion also uses funds from InfraBUIDL and InfraBUIDL AI, programs designed to fund Avalanche-based projects. “The funds will be distributed to support the medium-term growth of the Fusion ecosystem, including composers, modules and end-users,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

2025-05-20T12:19:07.000Z,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Seems Ready to Break Out of Consolidation Phase","XRP remains in a prolonged consolidation phase, trading within channels across both its USD and BTC pairs. The structure is tightening, signalling an imminent breakout. However, momentum has cooled, and the market is awaiting a catalyst. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair XRP/USDT continues to respect the boundaries of a large descending channel. The price recently failed to break above the $2.60–$2.80 resistance zone, which aligns with the upper trendline of the pattern. On the downside, the $2.10-$2.30 support area remains critical, especially with both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages holding below the price in this range. A confirmed breakdown of this level could open the door for a retest of the $1.90 zone, while a breakout above $2.60 may push the price toward the $3.20 region. Meanwhile, the RSI sits around 50%, indicating a neutral stance with a slight bearish bias. The BTC Pair XRP/BTC is compressing within a falling wedge, currently trading just above the 2100 SAT support area. The pair recently got rejected from the 2500 SAT resistance zone, which overlaps with the wedge’s upper trendline and the 100-day moving average. The 200-day MA near the 2300 SAT mark has also been broken to the downside, making further downside and breakdown of the 2100 region highly probable. The RSI also shows values around 40%, signaling that the bearish momentum is still in play. So, unless buyers step in soon, a breakdown from the wedge pattern could trigger further Ripple weakness against Bitcoin, which could also translate to a downtrend against the dollar.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin. According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra , the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated. “This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction. Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space. “If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said. Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton Mail Government says review may follow The Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation. The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.” Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registration While this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers. The lawyer also showed that he misunderstood the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, claiming that he was from Japan: “It was created by someone from Japan who used a fake name.” Concerns over misuse Kant also expressed concern over the misuse of cryptocurrencies during the hearing. He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.” Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.” India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators. The lack of regulation has drawn criticism from both the industry and policymakers amid the asset class’s continued growth.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin breaks past $105k, all eyes are turning to early-stage memecoins, and leading the charge is Pepeto, a low-cap contender stirring serious buzz. The crypto market is roaring once again as Bitcoin smashes through the $105,000 mark, reigniting investor interest across the entire digital asset landscape. But while BTC celebrates its new highs, savvy investors are shifting their focus to where the real upside lies, early-stage meme coins with momentum, narrative, and unmatched upside potential. And leading the charge? A project that’s quickly stealing the spotlight: Pepeto. With a presale price of just $0.000000129, Pepeto isn’t just another frog-themed memecoin, it’s a statement. Born from the untold chapters of Pepe’s history, Pepeto reclaims the original vision left behind. There’s even growing buzz in the crypto community that one of the original PEPE founders, allegedly pushed out before launch, is now behind Pepeto, finally delivering the roadmap, that was once abandoned. That story alone is fueling speculation and sparking community-driven momentum that’s impossible to ignore. But Pepeto’s appeal isn’t just tied to lore. It’s also deeply rooted in utility and strategy. The team has been steadily teasing a top-tier 1 exchange listing, expected to drop soon, a milestone that could massively boost visibility and credibility. Add to that the upcoming Pepeto Exchange, a memecoin-focused platform that offers zero listing fees and AI-powered fraud detection, and it’s clear that Pepeto isn’t just riding the meme wave, it’s shaping it. The project also integrates PepetoSwap, an advanced cross-chain bridge designed to make transfers between blockchains seamless, secure, and cost-effective. With a 420 trillion token supply, mirroring PEPE’s, and a rapidly growing community, Pepeto is positioning itself not just as a meme, but as a movement. While coins like Shiba and Pepe had their moments, Pepeto is giving the next generation of memecoin believers something fresh to rally behind.

DigiAsia reported in an update in April that it forecast $101 million in revenue and $12 million in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for 2024. It remains to be seen whether the company will successfully raise funds and implement its Bitcoin purchasing strategy, but the announcement has clearly piqued the interest of investors. DigiAsia joins companies like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet that are positioning Bitcoin as a long-term institutional asset. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T12:08:30.000Z,"Strategy's STRK Hits Record Proceeds, Has Outperformed Bitcoin, S&P 500 Since Debut","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this report owns shares of Strategy (MSTR). Strategy’s (MSTR) perpetual preferred stock, STRK, achieved the largest proceeds from its weekly at-the-market (ATM) issuance since the program started in February, according to X account DogCandles , raising $59.7 million that was used to buy more bitcoin BTC, according to a Monday SEC filing. That amount corresponds to the issuance of approximately 621,555 STRK shares. Strategy has about $20.79 billion still available in the STRK ATM facility. The company led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is plowing ahead with its bitcoin-buying strategy even as the price of the largest cryptocurrency holds above $100,000, with an eye on its January record of $109,000. Strategy's Monday BTC purchase took its total holdings to 576,230 BTC. This represents a 16.3% BTC yield , a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the year-to-date percentage increase in the ratio of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, effectively measuring the growth in BTC exposure on a per-share basis. The recent STRK issuance represents just under 9% of the total proceeds generated from the ATM program for the common stock, which has raised $705.7 million to date. This highlights the increasing role STRK is playing in Strategy’s bitcoin acquisition model. STRK features a fixed 8% annual dividend, which is based on the $100 per share liquidation preference, resulting in an annual payout of $8.00 per share. That gives it an effective yield, annual dividend divided by STRK share price, of 8.1%. Importantly, this yield is inversely related to the share price. As STRK trades higher, the yield decreases, and vice versa. Since its launch on Feb. 10, STRK has risen by 16%, outperforming both bitcoin, which has added 10%, and the S&P 500, which has declined by 2% over the same period. According to data from the Strategy dashboard, STRK exhibits the lowest correlation with MSTR common stock, sitting at just 44%. In contrast, STRK maintains relatively higher correlations with broader market benchmarks: 71% with bitcoin and 72% with the SPY exchange-traded fund. This suggests that STRK trades with a unique profile, potentially appealing to investors seeking differentiated exposure due to its hybrid nature as a preferred equity instrument with bitcoin-tied capital deployment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/20/strategys-strk-hits-record-proceeds-has-outperformed-bitcoin-sp-500-since-debut,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|S&P 500|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T12:03:14.000Z,"Bitcoin Dominance Drops; Bullish and Bearish Altcoin Scenarios Revealed","The post Bitcoin Dominance Drops; Bullish and Bearish Altcoin Scenarios Revealed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is off to a strong start today, as Bitcoin is close to its highest price ever, and altcoins are also going up. The rally comes as the GENIUS stablecoin bill passed a key vote in the Senate, which lifted market confidence. If BTC breaks past its $109K all-time high, it could drive prices even higher, triggering a full-blown altcoin season. Crypto market just broke out after 3 years and retested key levels. Analysts believe that altcoins will rally more than BTC due to the upcoming rate cuts, staking ETFs, and new regulations that will boost risk assets. Bitcoin vs Altcoins The battle between Bitcoin and altcoins is heating up and it all comes down to one crucial level on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. Bitcoin Dominance is currently at 64%, a crossroads that could either send altcoins crashing or launch them into a new rally. What happens next could shape the short to mid-term outlook for altcoins. What If Bitcoin Dominance Rises? If Bitcoin moves higher from here, breaking above the 64% dominance, then it could attract even more attention and capital. This could mean that altcoins might stay weak or even drop further. But if Bitcoin gets pushed down below 64%, then altcoins could bounce, sparking an altcoin rally in the market. If Bitcoin’s price keeps climbing, then BTC dominance could stay high and altcoins will lag behind. And if Bitcoin pulls back or stays steady, altcoins will get a chance to shine on. Altcoin Season To Start After BTC Hits Key Level Arthur Hayes predicts that altcoin season will not start until Bitcoin breaks above $110,000. Once that level is cleared, Bitcoin could rally toward $150K–$200K by summer, with profits likely flowing into altcoins soon after. He expects the 2025 alt season to be smaller than 2021’s noting that many older tokens with high FDVs and low demand may not bounce back. Is It Too Early For Altcoin Season? Ethereum has outpaced Bitcoin, pushing the ETH/BTC pair up 34% in a week, its first major breakout since Dec 2024. This has fueled altcoin season talks. However, key indicators say it’s not here yet. Altseason isn't cancelled. It's delayed! pic.twitter.com/iyykrJD68J — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) May 20, 2025 In 2022, Ethereum jumped 121% in just over a month, that sparked a major altcoin season. Back then, 75% of the top 50 coins outperformed Bitcoin, and the altcoin season index hit 96. However, currently the Altcoin Season Index is just at 25, and only 18% of top 50 coins are outperfroming BTC. A full altcoin season may still be a few weeks away, but its not confirmed yet. Bitcoin Dominance has dropped to 63% as of writing. Will Markets Stablilise? Some analysts claim that the drop in Bitcoin dominance does not guarantee an altcoin season. Investors might shift to Bitcoin if volatility kicks in again due to the ongoing macro uncertainties. Instead, with both bitcoin and altcoins having strong reasons to stay, the market could stabilize rather than shift dramatically.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-dominance-drops-bullish-and-bearish-altcoin-scenarios-revealed/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T11:47:02.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 20, 2025?","In a significant turn, all top 100 coins per market cap saw a notable upswing, largely driven by institutional adoption and regulatory developments. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.2% over the past 24 hours, now standing at $3.46 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $124 billion at the time of writing. TLDR: The crypto market has recorded a significant upswing, turning all the top 100 coins green; BTC briefly surpassed the weekly high of $106,500 yet again, before pulling back to $105,500; ‘Current Price May Be a New Baseline, Not a Transient Bubble’; Institutional interest and positive regulatory developments support the rally, primarily the US stablecoin bill advancement and the JPMorgan BTC announcement; The rally may be sustainable, not including typical pullbacks, but worries remain about overconfidence leading to corrections. Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 20, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers In a sharp reversal from yesterday, when all top 10 coins per market cap were red, all have turned green today. Recording the highest decrease a day ago, Ethereum (ETH) is the best performer today. It’s up 7.1% to the price of $2,544. Its daily high is $2,693. Solana (SOL) is the second-highest gainer, having risen 4.8% to $168. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated 3%, now trading at $105,498. This is a pullback from the day’s high of $106,518. Notably, not a single one of the top 100 coins saw their prices decrease in this time frame. Three recorded double-digit increases, becoming the day’s best performers. Aave (AAVE) is up 24.3% to the current price of $267.23, while Curve DAO (CRV) increased by 11% to the price of $0.7346. Lastly, Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is up 10%, now changing hands at $1.97. Overall, the current upswing in the crypto market seems to be the result of a beneficial combination of institutional involvement, regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and technical market indicators. More specifically, following a week of intense negotiations, the US Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. However, a final vote to pass the act will likely have to wait until after a federal holiday on 26 May. Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 20, 2025 ‘Current Price May Be a New Baseline, Not a Transient Bubble’ James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, commented on the similarities between the current bull run and BTC’s boom in November 2024, especially given the proximity to the all-time high. “There are definitely echoes of similarity,” he argues. In May 2025, Bitcoin increased from $94,000 to over $106,000, which was a 13% rise. Yes, “November’s bull run was far more energetic.” The price went up by 37% in a month, from $70,000 to $96,000. Nonetheless, “many of the driving forces appear to be the same with both periods marked by rapid price increases and strong institutional interest,” Toledano says. The current rise is fueled by the cooling tariffs, which helped ease market chaos and increased ETF inflows. Also, “unlike the largely sentiment-driven November rally, the current uptrend seems to be underpinned by tangible institutional adoption and policy support, suggesting a more sustainable growth trajectory.” According to Toledano, speculative elements remain, but the combination of institutional adoption and favorable economic conditions “suggests that the current price levels may represent a new baseline rather than a transient bubble, but as always anything is possible in crypto.” #BTC 's price surge stalled just below $106.6K – a level with 31K $BTC held at that cost basis. This supply cluster originated on Dec 16 and remains unshaken. Holders haven’t redistributed, nor averaged down – making $106.6K an important level to watch in the short term. pic.twitter.com/f7rXqtP6qD — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next Since yesterday, Bitcoin has surpassed the weekly high of $104,400, previously seen in December 2024, and it has hit a new weekly high of $106,518. As BTC broke briefly through the $106,000 level, it now needs to be seen if it’ll be able to grab and hold it for long enough to be propelled further up. On the other hand, a support level is at $103,870, followed by the next significant one at $102,250, and then $97,000. The latter one is critical as a previous consolidation zone. Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 71 to 68. This suggests optimistic sentiment, signaling investor confidence and willingness to take risks. This is typically the result of rising prices, increased buying, and high trading volumes. However, greed can also signal overvaluation and precede corrections. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, the market is boosted by investors entering it. Notably, US Banking giant JPMorgan will soon let clients buy Bitcoin . CEO and Bitcoin critic Jamie Dimon said on Monday: “We are going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 Additionally, there have been consistent spot ETF inflows supporting the price rise. According to a May 19 report by digital asset manager CoinShares , digital asset investment products recorded a fifth consecutive week of inflows last week, with $785 million. With this, the year-to-date inflows increased to $7.5 billion. On the one hand, this amount surpassed the previous high of $7.2 billion from early February. On the other hand, it “also fully recovers the near $7 billion of outflows experienced during the February–March price correction.” Source: CoinChares Meanwhile, the US Justice Department has opened an investigation into the recent security breach at Coinbase Global. Depending on the course of the investigation, it may have an impact on the market. What kind of impact, remains to be seen. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto market and the US stock markets posted gains due to the increase in investor optimism and macro elements overall. While the crypto market turned green across the board since yesterday, the S&P 500 went up 0.088%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.089%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.32%. That said, investors seem slightly more confident in the crypto markets today, especially as the US dollar has weakened. Is this dip sustainable? The current rally seems to be supported by significant institutional interest, as well as encouraging regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions. Still, liquidity and market sentiment remain a concern, signaling continued caution.

2025-05-20T11:40:38.000Z,"8 Crypto Startups Powering the Next Wave of Embedded Finance","The post 8 Crypto Startups Powering the Next Wave of Embedded Finance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Embedded finance is everywhere. That’s its job. Rather than forcing you to visit a payment gateway every time you need to pay for something online, or to open your banking app when you order an Uber, embedded finance brings the checkout to you. By integrating directly into the social media apps and other non-financial platforms you use, it makes life that little bit simpler by eliminating friction. Even if you haven’t used the term, you’ve certainly used embedded financial services in your daily life. Powered by APIs and smart fintech solutions, the technology enhances user experience and expands access to financial services. And we’re not just talking about traditional financial services either: the same trend applies equally to crypto, which has been quietly making in-roads into mainstream apps and websites. Credit for driving this stealth takeover must go to the following crypto companies in particular, which have done more than most to deeply embed web3 services into every facet of our digital lives. Stripe As a global fintech payments leader, Stripe needs no introduction. It does it all and that includes crypto. Despite not being a crypto-native company, Stripe’s on- and off-ramp APIs allow developers to connect crypto to their apps effortlessly. From Coinbase to Uniswap and MetaMask to Phantom, Stripe’s worked with a host of leading crypto companies and its pilot with Solana and USDC is a case study in how major fintechs can embrace digital assets. Like Circle, Stripe is primarily interested in stablecoins when it comes to crypto acceptance and it deserves credit for working quietly yet efficiently to mainstream stablecoin acceptance among global businesses. Thanks to its Stablecoin Financial Accounts service, companies in more than 100 companies can accept assets such as USDC and connect blockchain rails to traditional financial ones such as SEPA and ACH. Mercuryo Mercuryo is a full-stack fiat-crypto infrastructure provider that’s intent on making it easier to move money in and out of the thriving cryptoconomy. It’s deeply integrated into a slew of fintech applications, both web3 and web2, making fiat-crypto conversion a cinch. Mercuryo’s on-ramps can be found in the apps you use everyday and the DeFi services you connect to using your web wallet, bolstered by Passkey login for biometric UX that adds an additional layer of security while simplifying authentication. When you decide it’s time to convert your cold storage crypto back into fiat, for example, Mercuryo’s Ledger Live integration is the solution you turn to. Its Spend crypto debit card, embedded in Ledger Live and other major wallets such as MetaMask, securely facilitates this. Mercuryo does similar for centralized crypto exchanges too such as Bitget and Bybit and has recently added partners such as zkSync and 1inch. The power of Mercuryo lies in its ability to make crypto spendable in the real world without needing to leave the sanctity of your web wallet or switching apps. It’s convenient and it’s just what crypto needs to inch its way into mainstream finance. Circle You might not have interacted with them directly, but if you’re a crypto user, you’ve almost certainly used Circle . Issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin by market cap with a total supply approaching $50B , Circle has done more than virtually any other company to mainstream crypto adoption. Not by shilling volatile tokens, but by quietly providing the infrastructure for blockchain-based payments to flourish. Dull, predictable, and drama-free, USDC does everything you could ever wish of a stablecoin. But driving mainstream adoption of stablecoins calls for more than merely issuing millions of the tokens onchain: there needs to be a way of getting them into the wallets of ordinary people – people who might not ordinarily have cause to consider using crypto. To achieve that, Circle’s constructed APIs and SDKs to embed stablecoin payments and treasury management into web2 and web3 platforms. Circle has its tentacles into fintech and e-commerce apps all over the web, making it easier to pay for goods and services using USDC. Zero Hash Zero Hash is a lot better than it sounds. Its API-based infra is all about making crypto easier for businesses to accept – with a particular focus on stablecoins. Are you spotting a pattern yet? Zero Hash has proven to be particularly popular with neobanks and fintechs that are looking to add crypto functionality. After getting them accustomed to the softer stuff – stablecoins – Zero Hash is amenable to serving them harder cryptos such as BTC, but all in good time. A phrase you’ll encounter a lot in the context of embedded finance is “turnkey” which can be loosely translated as “we’ll do the hard work for you.” Zero Hash’s turnkey solution allows your business to send and receive crypto without getting bogged down in integration and regulation. With more than $45B in volume settled through its infra, Zero Hash is the largest crypto company you’ve never heard of. That’s because it’s all abstracted away, freeing the company to focus on supplying crypto-as-a-service infrastructure to power trading, custody, and rewards in apps such as Step and Stripe. Ramp Network Looking for an on-ramp? An off-ramp perhaps? There’s a full-stack crypto provider out there that’s got what you need. Ramp Network is in the ramp business, giving web2 and web3 companies the tools they need to move from onchain to off and then back again on a dime. Its embeddable fiat-crypto ramps, complete with customizable UX, slot seamlessly into your app – that’s why they call it embedded finance. There’s a lot to like about Ramp, such as free integration, excellent support, and the promise of ultra-fast transactions, putting an end to interminable waiting for crypto to confirm. This may not mean much to the current generation of crypto kids, but to the OGs who were raised on Bitcoin’s 10-minute block times – with no instant mempool confirmation – it means a lot. Integrated into leading wallets such as Ledger, Brave, and Trust Wallet, Ramp is a much-loved gateway to and from the cryptosphere. All roads lead through Ramp. Stables No surprises for guessing what Stables is all about. The Australian startup offers stablecoin-powered wallets and Mastercard debit cards that integrate into everyday apps. The firm’s all about making it easier to use dollar-pegged tokens in daily life, be it for savings, bill payments, or groceries. Users can access Apple or Google Pay via the Stables app, with the crypto-fiat conversion slickly handled in the background. Stables is also popular with users requiring remittance services – something that stablecoins are well equipped to do given their borderless nature and instant settlement. The Stables app allows users to send stablecoins and receive cash, converting to more than 30 fiat currencies. Particularly popular across APAC markets, Stables is bringing onchain payments into the real world by blurring the lines between where one ends and the other begins. Unlimit Unlimit is a UK-based payment processor that bridges traditional finance and crypto via embedded rails for DeFi, wallets, and exchanges. Its cross-border, plug-and-play payment modules are prized by crypto companies expanding into global markets. Unlimit’s target market is businesses operating across EMEA, APAC, and LatAm, but it’ll work anywhere there’s a web connection and a need to convert between currencies. Unlimit helps businesses accept credit and debit cards in multiple currencies and from all the major card issuers. As a result, it forms a universal solution for businesses that are looking to expand but don’t want to get bogged down in regional regulations and red tape. A single API integration courtesy of Unlimit allows web businesses to accept it all. Nunchuk Nunchuk is a little different from the other companies featured here in that its primary business is Bitcoin custody. But make no mistake, it’s still a participant in embedded finance, since its multisig solutions are designed to be easily integrated by third parties. Nunchuk allows multisig key management, spending policies, and hardware security to be embedded into DeFi and treasury tools. As Bitcoin evolves into a global currency and digital gold – the bedrock for a host of other financial products – it’s critical that security for managing it is top-notch. In the future, you’ll take a loan against your BTC assets and Nunchuk’s multsig technology will protect it all, ensuring that everyone from DAOs to institutions is able to offer Bitcoin-backed products. Embedded Finance Is Taking Root Embedded crypto finance is the quiet revolution, mainstreaming digital assets from stablecoins to BTC with little fanfare. When it’s working properly – as it invariably is – you don’t even notice it’s there. But that’s the whole point. Its role is to meet people where they are on their turf, be it their favorite video game or their go-to social media app. For payments and savings; for tipping and remittance; for on-ramping and off-ramping. For value transfer of all kinds, crypto’s leading payment specialists are proving that anything traditional finance can do, they can do every bit as well.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/8-crypto-startups-powering-the-next-wave-of-embedded-finance/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC","Information",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T11:40:32.000Z,"Genesis Sues DCG and Barry Silbert for $3.3B Over Alleged Fraud and Asset Drain","The post Genesis Sues DCG and Barry Silbert for $3.3B Over Alleged Fraud and Asset Drain appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Genesis Global Capital, the crypto lending firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2023, has launched two major lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG) , and CEO Barry Silbert . The allegations are serious— fraud, reckless mismanagement, and siphoning over $1 billion in assets from Genesis. At the heart of the case: Genesis’s creditors are still owed over $2.2 billion , and the company now seeks to recover $3.3 billion through legal action. Key Allegations Against DCG and Barry Silbert Sham transactions and insider deals allegedly drained Genesis of its assets. Genesis accuses DCG of using the company like a “corporate ATM.” The lawsuits claim strategic mismanagement led to forced exposure to risky, illiquid assets like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares. Over $1.2 billion was withdrawn from Genesis after it was allegedly already insolvent. Let’s break down the two lawsuits. Lawsuit 1: Genesis vs DCG in Delaware Court Filed in Delaware , this lawsuit targets fraud and reckless mismanagement by DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. The filing outlines a series of questionable decisions made to favor DCG and its subsidiaries —especially Grayscale —at the expense of Genesis and its creditors. Highlights: Genesis claims it was forced to accept GBTC shares as collateral, a move that amplified risk due to their illiquidity. DCG is accused of draining over $1 billion in value through insider loans and financial engineering. The suit alleges DCG prioritized its own interests while retail and institutional lenders suffered massive losses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : South Korea Eyes Won-Backed Stablecoin Ahead of 2025 Presidential Election , Lawsuit 2: Bankruptcy Filing in New York Court The second lawsuit, filed in the New York bankruptcy court , dives deeper into insider withdrawals and mismanagement during market turmoil . Key Points: DCG allegedly withdrew $1.2 billion in crypto and cash while Genesis was insolvent. The withdrawals occurred during major crypto crashes —including Terra-Luna, 3AC, and FTX . Meanwhile, insiders reportedly recovered almost all their funds , while external clients remain at a loss. Who’s Paying the Price? Despite the legal action, it’s the retail and institutional clients who bear the brunt of Genesis’s collapse. With over $14 billion in outstanding loans at the time of its bankruptcy, the scale of the fallout is enormous.Genesis aims to recover $3.3 billion through these lawsuits.

2025-05-20T11:38:09.000Z,"Moody's Downgrade of US Credit Rating Reflected Positively on Crypto Market! Here is the Latest Data","The cryptocurrency market continues its upward momentum. Ethereum (ETH) rose 8% to above $2,900, while Bitcoin (BTC) climbed towards the $106,000 level. Ethereum Up 8%, Bitcoin Nears $108,000: Cryptocurrencies Outperform as Market Unrest Continues This rise came despite the widespread risk aversion in traditional markets following Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating. The surprising resilience of digital assets has been in sharp contrast to stocks and gold, which have slumped in response to Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to persistent fiscal deficits and rising political polarization. Gold, often a traditional hedge during times of uncertainty, is down about 7% from its May highs, while stocks are also down. Meanwhile, Bitcoin pulled back slightly after briefly touching $107,000 on Sunday. “Despite the risk aversion in stocks following Moody’s downgrade, Bitcoin’s rally over the weekend has strengthened Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate store of value.” Despite Ethereum not being a new catalyst, it outperformed other major tokens on the day, driven by renewed staking interest and sentiment around the recent Pectra update. ETH’s rally has added to the optimism in the altcoin market. Other notable moves included: Solana (SOL), XRP, BNB and Dogecoin (DOGE) are all up between 2-4%. Aave (AAVE) is up over 25%, but the increase appears speculative as no new governance proposals or technical updates have been reported. The DeFi token remains 60% below its 2021 highs. Analysts have noted a developing divergence between bitcoin and traditional hard assets such as gold, which often move together during periods of macroeconomic stress. “Unlike previous months when BTC and gold rose together, bitcoin is rising despite the decline in spot gold prices, and this is reflected in ETF flows.” — Augustine Fan, SignalPlus Fan noted that while gold ETFs have seen recent outflows, bitcoin ETF products have continued to attract capital, including through futures markets on the CME. The divergence could signal a shift in investor preferences and the relative value opportunities emerging between the two stores of value, he added. As global macro uncertainty persists, the strength cryptocurrencies have shown in the face of broader market weakness could further solidify their role in diversified portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T11:35:44.000Z,"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick offloads Cantor Fitzgerald stakes, leaving crypto behind","Howard Lutnick has given up control of Cantor Fitzgerald, ending over 30 years of leadership at one of Wall Street’s most well-known firms. On Monday, Cantor confirmed that Howard transferred his entire stake in the company to his children and a group of outside investors. The decision comes after his February 24 swearing-in as Commerce Secretary under President Donald Trump, and it fulfills ethics rules requiring officials to cut financial ties that might create conflicts of interest. According to Reuters, the stake is going into trusts for Howard’s adult children, with control resting in the hands of his son Brandon Lutnick, who now serves as Cantor’s CEO and chairman. In addition to the family transfer, Cantor announced that Josh Harris, founder of alternative asset firm 26North, and Glenn August, who runs Oak Hill Advisors, will join as minority investors. Howard gives up BGC and Newmark shares worth $278 million Howard also sold off his Class A shares in two of Cantor’s biggest subsidiaries. He sold BGC Group shares for $151.5 million and shares in Newmark Group, a real estate firm, for $127 million. Both companies bought the shares back directly. Cantor Fitzgerald will also take ownership of his Class B BGC shares, keeping majority control of both BGC and Newmark in-house. Cantor said Howard will no longer receive any financial benefits from Cantor Fitzgerald, BGC, or Newmark as of May 16. “Secretary Lutnick has fully complied with federal ethics obligations,” the firm said in a statement. That includes stepping away from any future income or equity tied to his longtime companies. This clears the way for Brandon, who is now fully running the show, to drive Cantor into crypto—a path his father set in motion but now legally has to step away from. Howard had previously helped structure partnerships between Cantor and Tether , a major stablecoin company. Brandon is taking that foundation and pushing forward with a much bigger plan. Brandon Lutnick leads Twenty One Capital with $3.6 billion bitcoin fund Brandon is now working with Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank to launch a bitcoin holding vehicle called Twenty One Capital. The fund will start with 42,000 Bitcoins, which would make it the third-largest BTC reserve in the world. Brandon’s plan is to create a public crypto company modeled after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which grew its market cap to $91 billion after loading up on Bitcoin. The vehicle is being built through a reverse merger with Cantor Equity Partners, Brandon’s SPAC that raised $100 million in 2024. According to Twenty One Capital, the entire deal values the firm at $3.6 billion, assuming Bitcoin stays at $85,000. The goal is to go even bigger by raising a $385 million convertible bond and a $200 million private equity placement to buy more Bitcoins on top of the initial reserves. Each of the partners is contributing Bitcoin directly. Tether will provide $1.5 billion in BTC. SoftBank and Bitfinex will add the rest, though exact numbers weren’t disclosed. Eventually, all of their Bitcoin will be converted into shares in Twenty One Capital. The pricing is already set: $13 per share for the private placement, and $10 per share for the convertible bond round. Brandon’s goal is to create a new kind of crypto investment company that sits alongside the industry’s largest players. The firm said in April that its structure allows it to “absorb billions in crypto” and position itself for long-term holdings—just like Strategy, but backed by some of the most powerful names in crypto finance. Howard, for now, is out of all of it. He’s no longer allowed to touch any part of the Cantor crypto pipeline. And with President Trump in the White House again, the pressure on top officials to comply with conflict-of-interest laws is higher than ever. Brandon is still using the Cantor name, but it’s clear he’s steering it somewhere very different than Howard ever did. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-20T11:34:05.000Z,"Why Bitcoin’s guarantee of $135,000 target could emerge this week","Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be on the verge of a major technical breakout that could come as early as this week, potentially targeting a record high of $135,000. In this line, analysis by TradingShot indicated that the asset is set to form its first one-day golden cross in seven months, the last occurring on October 27, 2024, which could trigger an immediate surge, the analyst noted in a TradingView post on May 20. This bullish signal, where the 50-day moving average ( MA ) crosses above the 200-day MA, has historically preceded strong rallies. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s next price target Notably, every one-day golden cross within Bitcoin’s two-and-a-half-year ascending channel has sparked a rapid price increase, with the smallest gain at 33.11%. The analyst projected a move to roughly $135,000 from the current price, aligning with the 0.236 Fibonacci level. Further strengthening the case, the one-week Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) has already flashed a bullish cross, a signal that preceded the last three golden crosses. These indicators suggest a breakout above Bitcoin’s previous all-time high of $109,000 may be imminent. After bouncing back strongly from the trade tension correction, Bitcoin is regaining momentum within its rising channel. Adding to the optimism, crypto analyst MikybullCrypto noted in a May 20 X post that, if confirmed, the golden cross could propel Bitcoin toward $145,000 based on historical patterns.

It has also claimed the sixth-largest asset by market cap position, surpassing Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Meanwhile, capital inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) are accelerating. On May 19, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $667.4 million in net inflows, the highest since May 2, driven by $306 million into the iShares Bitcoin Trust.

Source: Finbold While sentiment remains bullish, Bitcoin’s momentum could face short-term resistance. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) is 68, approaching overbought territory. Still, Bitcoin remains firmly above key technical levels. For instance, the 50-day ($92,255) and 200-day ($86,257) simple moving averages sit well below the current price, reinforcing its strong upward trend.

Country's Supreme Court Raps Government","India's Supreme Court has questioned why the country's central government cannot formulate a \""clear cut\"" policy on crypto regulation, the Economic Times reported on Monday . Justice Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said that there is \""parallel under-market\"" for cryptocurrency that can affect the economy. \""Why does centre not come out with a clear cut policy on regulating cryptocurrency?\"" they posed. \""By regulating the cryptocurrency, you can keep an eye on the trade.\"" Justice Kant added that bitcoin (BTC) trading is \""an illicit trade more or less like a Hawala business,\"" referring to a term used for the informal transferring of money from one place to another without the actual movement of physical money. Hawala transactions are illegal in India. The justices posed their question to Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, who requested to seek instruction on the matter. They were speaking while hearing a bail petition filed by Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, a Gujarat resident accused of crypto-related fraud. Bhati had claimed Bhatt was one of the biggest BTC trade aggregators in Gujarat, victimizing others with promises of high returns. The court however said that it could not ascertain whether Bhatt was a victimizer or a victim, lamenting the government's inability to come up with a clear regime regulating cryptocurrency. India's government had plans to release a discussion paper outlining its crypto policy stance by September last year, though this has yet to materialize.

2025-05-20T11:30:22.000Z,"Aave surges on Bitcoin and Ethereum rally","Aave (AAVE) rose more than 22% as the crypto market witnessed a sharp recovery for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. With BTC bouncing to above $105k after amid a volatile start to the week, Ethereum recaptured the $2,500 level to leave bears nursing pain after failing to strengthen around $2.3k. The gains for the top two digital assets by market cap helped altcoins higher. Aave price rose sharply, outpacing top 100 coins by market cap with 22% increase to highs of $269. It’s AAVE’s highest level in three months. The surge saw bulls retest a key level that could be important to buyers if the uptrend continues. QCP Group posted on X: As equities wobble under a cautious Fed and a Moody’s downgrade, Trump is feeling the heat — lashing out at Walmart and even hinting at a trip to China to revive trade talks. But amidst the macro noise, Bitcoin is holding steady. Why is Aave price spiking? As noted, most cryptocurrencies pumped after seeing a notable dip early Monday. But as the market reacted to regulatory developments in the United States, BTC shot up. ETH followed suit, and a cascading effect had buyers taking the dip as opportunity. However, Aave price also spiked as the decentralized finance protocol hit a key partnership milestone. On May 19, the Aave team announced that its integration with Aptos was live. “Aave’s v3 deployment on Aptos introduces a new era of cross-chain lending logic, rewritten in Move and ready for review,” the Aave team noted. It marks a new era for DeFi market’s leading protocol. Significantly, Aave has seen it’s total value locked skyrocket to a new all-time high. On May 12, 2025, the Aave TVL surpassed $40 billion, the highest ever mark for a DeFi protocol. AAVE’s TVL is almost four times that of the centralized finance lending market. “The TVL of CeFi lending: ~$11 billion. The TVL of AAVE: ~$39 billion,” crypto analyst The DeFi Investor pointed out recently. A single dApp has almost 4 times more TVL than CeFi lending sector. What next for Aave price? Crypto market outlook, Aave protocol growth and the Aptos integration are some of the current catalysts for the altcoin. Gains means bulls may eye $300 and then December 2024 peak of $383. Aave price has a year to date high of $275. If profit taking derails bulls, key support would be around $200 and then $175.

Despite the short-term volatility, key indicators justify that the market structure remains bullish. A shift in Bitcoin dominance and RSI behaviour could signal the onset of a strong altcoin rally. In this analysis, we explore market movements, key technical levels, and what you, as an investor/trader, could expect next! BTC Dominance at a Crossroads: Bitcoin vs Altcoins? The analysis by Front Runners mentions that BTC.D is currently testing the 64% resistance zone. The post highlights that a breakout from here could extend Bitcoin’s strength at the cost of altcoin performance. Conversely, a rejection would possibly mark a monetary shift into altcoins, giving a boost to their momentum and setting the stage for an aggressive rally. If BTC dominance fails to break above the 64% barrier and the total market cap forms a base near support, altcoins are expected to outperform. That being said, this shift has historically led to the start of an altseason. $3.2 Trillion Test: Pullback or Trend Reversal? The total market cap of the crypto industry has fallen to $3.32T, but what keeps the hope intact is that it has not broken the key support at $3.24T. Mayo Insights highlights that this indicates a temporary dip, and not a collapse. The RSI has reset to below 60 from overbought levels near 80, which is typical in bullish consolidations rather than bearish reversals. What About Indicators? The proponent highlights that RSI holding above 40 in a bull market signals that fear isn’t dominating. Moreover, the support levels between $3.0T and $3.11T align with the 50- and 100-day EMAs, offering an ideal accumulation area. A bounce from here would affirm the ongoing bullish momentum and likely bring altcoins into the spotlight. To know what Ethereum could do next, read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs What is altseason? Altseason is a phase in the bull cycle when altcoins outperform Bitcoin in price gains. This shift is driven by capital rotation and increased investor interest in altcoins. Where is Bitcoin dominance currently? Bitcoin dominance is presently at 62.9% and could test its resistance at 64%, failing which could boost altcoins. When could the altcoin season start?

Most respondents agreed that between 1% and 30% of gold reserves should be converted into BTC. 4 in 5 Americans want some US gold reserves converted to bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ibxXfe04g5 — The Nakamoto Project (@NakamotoProjct) May 19, 2025 Troy Cross, a co-founder of the Nakamoto Project, noted that people had doubts about the results, yet he assured them that they were accurate. He pointed out that only a small group of respondents suggested having 0% of the portfolio in Bitcoin. The majority of respondents chose to diversify, and younger respondents were more likely to pick Bitcoin than older ones. “When given a slider and asked to advise the US government on the right proportion of Bitcoin and gold, subjects were very reluctant to put that slider on 0% Bitcoin and 100% gold. Instead, they settled around 10% Bitcoin,” he explained. Satoshi Action Fund’s Dennis Porter said that the results were hard to trust because they showed a major shift in thought. He noted that Americans are now willing to use Bitcoin as a reserve asset rather than just relying on gold . Wh ite House s trategy could trigger massive Bitcoin a ccumulation Bo Hines at the White House has pushed for the Treasury Department to start investing in Bitcoin with funds from selling some gold. The plan could allow the government to buy up to 1 million BTC in the upcoming five years, massively increasing how much Bitcoin it holds. To fund Bitcoin purchases, the government is planning to sell Federal Reserve gold certificates. The proposal is consistent with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, which would declare Bitcoin as a key strategic national resource. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had previously recommended that the U.S. match its gold holdings with Bitcoin holdings. BiTBO reports that the U.S. owns 8,133 tons of gold worth over $830 billion and about 207,189 BTC valued at $22 billion. The plan allows for more increase in digital assets in the country. President Donald Trump has voiced his support and mentioned adopting Bitcoin as a strategy to make the U.S. a leader in digital finance. Many Republicans are endorsing digital asset policies, causing the federal atmosphere to adjust rapidly. States, corporations, and banks signal growing Bitcoin adoption There is increasing interest among companies to adopt Bitcoin. Recently, U.S. states have started adopting Bitcoin as part of their financial systems. Up to 5% of the state’s reserves can now be stored in Bitcoin and gold. Arizona is building a digital asset reserve using staking and token incentives, so it does not require funds from taxpayers. Corporations are following suit. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is continuing to increase its holdings of Bitcoin. Japanese company Metaplanet has invested part of its reserves in BTC, making Bitcoin a significant balance sheet asset. More banks are noticing the trend. According to JPMorgan analysts, Bitcoin is set to grow more rapidly than gold in 2025 because of new investors and important drivers. They reported that Bitcoin’s price has risen as gold’s price has fallen. “In all, we expect the YTD zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year. ” JP Morgan Bitcoin ETFs have received a lot of inflows, while gold ETFs such as SPDR Gold Trust have lost money since late April. According to JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the trend could persist for a while.

SBS Plus removed her from the final episode of “Because I’m Single.” Hwang has begun liquidating assets to repay the money ahead of a second hearing in August. South Korean actress Hwang Jung-eum has been removed from a major TV broadcast and commercial campaign after admitting in court to embezzling over $3 million from her own agency for cryptocurrency investments. The 39-year-old appeared before Jeju District Court last week, where she confessed to misappropriating ₩4.34 billion from a one-person agency she owned and operated. The prosecution has charged her under Korea’s Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. SBS Plus Cuts Hwang Jung-eum From Final Episode of ‘Because I’m Single’ The fallout was immediate. On Tuesday, SBS Plus announced that all of Hwang’s footage had been cut from the final episode of the reality show Because I’m Single . The network said her MC commentary would also be “minimized.” “I sincerely apologize for causing concern. I made the investment in hopes of growing the company, but it was a hasty and immature decision,” Hwang said in a public apology issued through her new agency, Y.One Entertainment. Meanwhile, health supplement brand Daesang Wellife Nucare pulled newly launched ads featuring the actress and canceled a related online event, citing “changes in internal schedules.” #HwangJungEum admits that she uses family company funds to invest in cryptocurrency.

(@KoreanUpdates) May 15, 2025 Hwang’s legal team argued that the embezzled funds originated from her own entertainment income, held temporarily by her company due to corporate restrictions on crypto ownership. “The agency’s profits come from her personal work, so they effectively belong to her,” her attorney stated. Hwang has reportedly sold a portion of her crypto assets and is preparing to liquidate real estate to cover the rest. Her next court date is set for August. The case unfolds as she navigates a highly publicized divorce and a recently attempted comeback on national television. South Korea Busts $540K Crypto Scam Ring Last week, South Korean police arrested 25 individuals tied to a major crypto scam ring that defrauded at least 48 victims out of ₩734 million ($540,000) by posing as crypto advisors. The groups operated fake call centers and counterfeit crypto exchanges, showing false profits to lure victims into larger investments. When victims tried to withdraw, they were ignored, and the scammers disappeared. Authorities have detained 20 suspects and continue investigating, warning that more victims may exist. Meanwhile, political support for institutional crypto investment is growing ahead of South Korea’s presidential elections. South Korea is set to go to the polls on June 3 after the Constitutional Court ruled to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier this year. Lee leads in most polls by a margin of about 20%. The DP has responded to the PPP’s bid to woo younger voters with crypto-friendly policies with its own crypto pledges. The party launched a Digital Asset Committee on May 13, headed by the pro-industry lawmaker Min Byoung-dug.

2025-05-20T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Stability Above $100K Is Cementing New Psychological Floor","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The big story in financial markets is not just global bond-market jitters , it's also bitcoin's (BTC) stability above $100,000. BTC has held above that level for 11 straight days after jumping sharply from around $75,000 in early April. Some might interpret that as a sign of uptrend exhaustion, but it could also be the market normalizing the six-figure mark. Think of it like this: When BTC first hit $100,000, many people likely thought, \""This is crazy. It's too expensive\"" and perhaps refrained from buying or even took profits on their holdings. But the longer it stays there, the more the price feels normal and becomes anchored in people's minds. In other words, don't be surprised if buying activity picks up across the spectrum of products tied to BTC. Confidence got a boost on Monday after Strategy, the largest publicly traded BTC holding firm, disclosed that it has recently bought 7,630 BTC at an average price of over $103,000. \""This aggressive buying campaign is aimed at solidifying $100K+ levels as the new floor for Bitcoin. ETF inflows echoed that strength,\"" Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN, told CoinDesk in an email. According to Fournier, a price rise in ether (ETH) \""seems driven more by organic demand than institutional flows — a potential sign of rising retail activity and decoupling performance between bitcoin and altcoins.\"" In other key developments, the market cap for Ethena Labs' synthetic stablecoin, USDe, has surged 35% to $5 billion in just over seven days, CoinDesk data show. The token maintains a soft peg with the U.S. dollar through an automated delta-hedging strategy that shorts bitcoin and ether perpetual futures to offset changes in the prices. The jump had some market observers drawing parallels with the sharp rise in the market cap weeks before BTC and the wider market went bonkers in November. Back then, Ethena's ENA token chalked out a five-fold rally to $1.25. Let's see if history repeats itself. The U.S. Senate on Monday voted in favor of the GENUIS Act, advancing the stablecoin bill to the final stage. \""The bill … could significantly boost market confidence and provide long-awaited clarity for issuers and investors alike, but doesn't fully address offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to play an outsized role in global liquidity,\"" Vugar Usi Zade, COO at Bitget, said in an email. \""For U.S.-based issuers, compliance will now come with steeper costs, likely accelerating consolidation across the market and favoring well-resourced players who can meet the new thresholds.\"" In traditional markets, yields on longer-duration bonds continued to rise across the advanced world, signaling growing concerns about the fiscal debt sustainability.

TokenFi’s association with Rice Robotics, which works with companies like Nvidia, Softbank and 7-Eleven Japan, lends legitimacy to the project’s RWA ambitions and strengthens long-term investor confidence in TOKEN, which sits at a $60 million market capitalization as of Tuesday. TokenFi will benefit from an upcoming RICE token airdrop to Floki and TokenFi holders, offering direct value accrual and potentially incentivizing new buyers and stakers of TOKEN in anticipation of eligibility. The TokenFi team said Monday it would be the title sponsor of the West Indies cricket team's tour of Ireland 2025, bringing its brand to viewers globally through broadcast partners like TNT Sports, Supersport and Fancode, giving the token a visibility boost among retail audiences.

Lee Jae-myung, the front-runner for president, wants to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin. And if it happens, it might flip the country’s financial system overnight and become the first to launch a government-backed digital currency that works? Won-Based Stablecoin To Launch Presidential candidate Lee has proposed a stablecoin backed by the Korean won, made just for the people of South Korea. And if it happens, it could completely turn into a full-blown national strategy, which will reduce the country’s reliance on foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar. Right now, Korean crypto traders mostly use U.S.-based stablecoins like USDT and USDC. But this means billions of dollars are leaving the country. In just three months this year, nearly $41 billion was withdrawn from Korean exchanges, much of it tied to dollar-backed coins. That’s money that could have stayed within Korea’s borders. Lee says, “We need a won-based stablecoin to stop national wealth from leaking overseas.” It’s a bold idea, and one that could help protect Korea’s economy in the long run. Crypto ETFs for the Masses Lee’s crypto vision doesn’t stop there. He also wants to legalize spot crypto ETFs, so people can invest in Bitcoin and other coins through regular stock exchanges. This would make crypto investing easier, safer, and more accessible, especially for those who don’t want to deal with wallets and exchanges. Even big institutions, like Korea’s National Pension Fund, might be allowed to invest once the market becomes more stable. Experts Are Split While many support the idea, some experts are warning about the risks. They believe stablecoins could act like “private banks,” creating money without enough control, and possibly shaking up the economy in dangerous ways. Still, others say now is the time for Korea to act. With 15 million crypto investors across the country, many of them young and eager to grow their wealth, there’s pressure on politicians to make bold moves. What’s Coming Next? To support all this, the government plans to introduce the Digital Asset Basic Act—a bill that would finally give crypto a proper legal framework in Korea. It will cover everything from stablecoin rules to how digital assets can be issued, traded, and regulated. If passed, it could open the door to a more open, fair, and modern financial system.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/south-korea-eyes-won-backed-stablecoin-ahead-of-2025-presidential-election/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T11:03:18.000Z,"CME’s XRP Futures Are Live: A Comparison with BTC, ETH Debuts","The launch of futures contracts for cryptocurrencies on regulated trading platforms like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is often significant, signaling institutional acceptance and opening the door for broader market participation. As such, first-day trading volumes can offer a valuable glimpse into market sentiment, liquidity, and investor appetite. With XRP joining Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the CME Group’s derivatives platform, comparisons are inevitable. XRP’s CME Debut: A Modest but Meaningful Start As CryptoPotato reported , on May 19, CME officially launched two XRP futures products: a standard contract, listed under the ticker code XRP, representing 50,000 tokens, and a micro contract (MXP) covering 2,500 XRP. With XRP trading at about $2.39, data from the exchange shows that the futures contracts recorded a combined notional volume of just over $19 million. This included 150 standard contracts totaling around $17.9 million and 207 micro contracts contributing roughly $1.23 million to the pot. In contrast, the launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures in December 2017 saw a far larger volume. According to CME statements at the time, on the first day, 1,049 BTC contracts were traded, equivalent to 5,254 BTC, given that one contract represented 5 BTC. The trades amounted to just over $100 million in daily trading volume, based on an average Bitcoin price of $19,100. On the other hand, ETH futures, launched on February 8, 2021, had a more tempered start compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. They registered over $34 million in day-one volumes, with 388 contracts traded. Each contract represented 50 ETH when the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was priced at around $1,800. Why the Discrepancy? Several factors may help explain the difference in launch volumes. First, market maturity and timing played an important role. CME’s BTC futures debut in 2017 came in the middle of a frenzied bull market and unprecedented media attention. Ethereum’s 2021 launch also benefited from bullish sentiment and growing institutional interest as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) pumped network usage. Meanwhile, while institutionally significant, yesterday’s introduction of the derivative platform’s XRP futures occurred in a market trying to find direction. Furthermore, the token still faces some regulatory headwinds. A long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs over the status of XRP, which many thought had finally concluded, hit a setback when Judge Analisa Torres rejected a proposed $50 million settlement between the two parties, citing procedural errors in their joint filing. Additionally, contract specifications matter. CME’s BTC and ETH contracts were traded at a time when there weren’t many crypto derivatives around, helping concentrate volume on the Chicago-based platform. However, its XRP product has entered a more competitive market, with well-established alternatives on Binance, Coinbase, and others.

The increased interest is partly due to the return of the base trading strategy, where investors go long on spot ETFs and short on futures contracts on the CME to capture risk-free returns. That yield, known as an annualized basis, has nearly doubled in the past month to near 9%, presenting an attractive arbitrage opportunity for institutional investors. “That base level has now returned to the area that is attracting professional capital. It’s a significant reversal from the sub-5% yields seen in April,” said senior analyst James Van Straten. CME Bitcoin futures volume reached $8.4 billion on Monday, the most since April 23 and indicating a revival of activity. Open interest rose by more than 30,000 contracts from April’s lows to 158,000 BTC, according to Velo data. While both volume and open interest remain below January highs, when BTC reached a new all-time high of $109,000, the recent surge suggests significant growth potential. The widening base appears to be drawing back participants who exited the market earlier in the year. For example, recent 13F filings revealed that the Wisconsin State Retirement Board sold off its Bitcoin ETF holdings in the first quarter. This decision was likely due to reduced arbitrage opportunities at the time. However, with the base now recovering, analysts predict that large investors could return to the market in the second quarter to take advantage of improved spreads. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T10:53:58.000Z,"Binance Tries Again to Move Securities Case Out of US Courts","This latest development is the latest chapter in a years-long legal saga that reached the Supreme Court, which declined to hear Binance's appeal. Meanwhile, Coinbase is under investigation by the US Department of Justice after a data breach involving bribed customer support agents led to estimated user losses of up to $400 million. The breach also helped facilitate a number of scams, and triggered multiple lawsuits and intensified scrutiny from the SEC. In Australia, a court ruling may revolutionize crypto tax law by declaring Bitcoin a form of money rather than property. The ruling could potentially unlock up to $1 billion AUD in capital gains tax refunds. It is also expected that the decision could set a global precedent if upheld. Binance Argues Lawsuit Must Go Crypto exchange Binance renewed its push to move a US class-action lawsuit to arbitration, and recently pointed out that users agreed to waive their rights to sue as a group under its terms of service. In a May 16 filing to a federal court in New York, Binance argued that its 2019 Terms of Use include a binding arbitration clause, which should apply to all claims that arose after Feb. 20, 2019. The company also stated that these terms contain a class-action waiver that should cover all the plaintiffs’ claims. Part of Binance’s filing (Source: PACER) This comes in response to a prior ruling by Judge Andrew Carter, who in March declined to send all claims to arbitration—particularly for users who bought digital tokens on Binance between April of 2017 and February of 2019. The judge also partially denied Binance’s arbitration request for post-2019 claims, pending further clarification on how broadly the arbitration clause should be applied. In its latest argument, Binance said that its earlier terms of service already reserved the right to update the agreement without notifying each user individually. The crypto firm is pushing for the court to uphold the arbitration clause and enforce the waiver across all the relevant time periods. The case has a long legal history. It was originally dismissed in March of 2022 after Judge Carter sided with Binance, which claimed it was not subject to US securities laws due to a lack of physical presence in the country. However, that decision was overturned by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in March 2024. Binance tried to appeal to the Supreme Court, which declined to take the case in January 2025. Binance’s legal challenges in North America have intensified over the past two years. In June of 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a high-profile lawsuit against Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities. That case was settled in November 2023 for $4.3 billion. In April 2024, Binance was also hit with a class-action lawsuit in Canada over alleged securities law violations. DOJ Probes Coinbase Data Breach Other crypto exchanges also find themselves in legal hot water. The US Department of Justice is reportedly investigating a data breach at Coinbase involving customer service agents in India who allegedly accepted bribes in exchange for giving criminals access to user information. The probe was first reported by Bloomberg on May 19, and it centers around a group of support contractors who were later terminated by Coinbase for abusing their system access. Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach on May 15 and said that it was working with the DOJ and international law enforcement agencies. Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, said that they were cooperiating and supporting the prosecution of the people who were involved. While Coinbase stated that no user passwords, private keys, or funds were directly exposed, the breach still facilitated a wave of social engineering attacks. One high-profile victim was reportedly a partner at Sequoia Capital. It is estimated that total user losses may have reached up to $400 million. To make things worse, the attackers demanded a $20 million extortion payment from Coinbase in exchange for silence, which the company refused to pay. Coinbase’s response to the data breach (Source: Coinbase ) Naturally, the breach led to multiple lawsuits from affected users, with claims that Coinbase failed to adequately protect personal data. Among the plaintiffs is a retired artist, Ed Suman , who says he lost $2 million due to the scam. At the same time, Coinbase is also under regulatory scrutiny from the SEC , which is examining whether the exchange misrepresented its number of verified users. The combination of legal pressures and security concerns also led to volatility in Coinbase’s stock. Court Shakes Up Crypto Tax Law in Australia In the latest crypto-related legal development from Australia, a recent court ruling could reshape the country’s approach to cryptocurrency taxation, and potentially unlock hundreds of millions in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds for Bitcoin users. The decision came as part of a criminal case involving former federal police officer William Wheatley, who was accused of stealing 81.6 Bitcoin in 2019. William Wheatley At the time, the digital assets were valued at approximately $492,000, but they are now worth over $13 million. In a landmark judgment, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin should be treated as a form of money rather than property, drawing parallels between the cryptocurrency and traditional Australian dollars. This classification stands in stark contrast to the Australian Taxation Office’s long-standing stance. Since 2014, the ATO categorized cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as CGT assets. Under this classification, any transaction involving the disposal of Bitcoin — whether it be a sale, exchange for another cryptocurrency, or use as payment for goods or services — constitutes a CGT event subject to taxation. The ruling, if upheld, will fundamentally challenge this framework by saying that Bitcoin operates as a monetary instrument rather than a tradable asset. Tax experts believe the ruling could have far-reaching consequences. Adrian Cartland, a tax lawyer that was interviewed by the Australian Financial Review , explained that if Bitcoin is not considered a CGT asset, then buying and selling it would carry no tax consequences. He estimated that Australians could be entitled to as much as 1 billion Australian dollars in potential CGT refunds. However, the ATO did not specifically confirm this figure and hold firm that there are no official estimates regarding the scale of possible refunds should the ruling be upheld on appeal. The outcome of any appeal could greatly impact not just Bitcoin holders but the broader legal and regulatory treatment of digital assets in Australia. Overall, the decision will be the start of a historic shift in recognizing cryptocurrency as money in the legal system, and it could inspire similar legal challenges to crypto tax regimes in other countries.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9186/binance-tries-again-to-move-securities-case-out-of-us-courts,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB","News|Legal",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T10:47:04.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K or Ozak AI to $1? Investors Debate 2025's Best Crypto Bet","Two vastly different projects—Bitcoin (BTC) and Ozak AI (OZ) —are at the center of a heated investor debate. One is the original crypto juggernaut with a proven track record; the other is a rising AI-powered altcoin still in its presale phase. The question is: will Bitcoin hit the coveted $250,000 mark, or will Ozak AI surge to $1 and offer a better return on investment? Bitcoin to $250K: Is the King Ready to Run Again? Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of legendary. From being worth a few cents to reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in 2021, Bitcoin has cemented its position as digital gold. With the recent halving in 2024 reducing mining rewards, many analysts believe the stage is set for another massive bull run. The $250K target may sound aggressive, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. Why some believe BTC could hit $250K: Institutional adoption is stronger than ever, with asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offering Bitcoin ETFs. Scarcity model post-halving supports bullish long-term price action. Macroeconomic shifts (inflation, fiat devaluation) continue to push investors toward decentralized assets. However, even if Bitcoin reaches $250,000, that represents roughly a 3x gain from current prices (~$65,000). Impressive—but not necessarily the life-changing ROI that some investors are seeking. Ozak AI: The Sleeper Altcoin With 300x Potential? While Bitcoin dominates headlines, Ozak AI is quietly building momentum as a new-age crypto backed by artificial intelligence. Priced at just $0.003 in its presale , Ozak AI is aiming for a realistic $1 target—a potential 300x return if achieved. It’s gaining traction as both a utility token and a high-growth speculative asset. What sets Ozak AI apart: AI integration: Offers decentralized tools for data analysis, trading bots, predictive modeling, and automation across DeFi platforms. Strong presale performance: Over $1 million raised, signaling early investor trust and demand. Low market cap entry: Smaller capital needed to make big moves compared to blue-chip cryptos. Narrative-driven appeal: Combining two of the hottest tech trends—AI and blockchain—makes it appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, which already commands a $1+ trillion market cap, Ozak AI’s journey is just beginning. The upside potential is undeniably larger for early backers if the project delivers on its roadmap. Bitcoin remains a solid bet for long-term wealth preservation and moderate growth, especially with institutional interest and a bullish post-halving setup. But for investors chasing exponential returns, Ozak AI’s $0.003 entry price and real-world AI utility offer a compelling case. While Bitcoin may climb to $250K by 2025, it’s the emerging plays like Ozak AI that could generate life-changing profits. For those with a higher risk appetite and belief in the future of AI and blockchain convergence, Ozak AI might just be the best crypto bet of 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that offers a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

2025-05-20T10:45:00.000Z,"Bitcoin privacy tool Payjoin receives $100K grant from Maelstrom","Bitcoin developer Ben Allen has received a $100,000 grant from investment firm Maelstrom to support the development of Payjoin, a privacy-focused tool aimed at improving Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy. According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy. Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev Kit Payjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction. “Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states. A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach: “We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“ Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEO Payjoin: Soon in wallets near you? Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time. The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added: “The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“ A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects. Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin? Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or not Hayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily. Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.

The survey, which involved 3,345 participants, asked how much of the gold reserve should be turned into BTC. Most preferred a conversion between 1% and 30%, with the median recommendation being 10% . The online survey was conducted from February to mid-March, with participants matched to U.S. Census demographics by age, gender, race, income, education, and region. Respondents were compensated for their time. Some questioned the credibility of the results, assuming it might only reflect the views of Bitcoin supporters. However, co-founder Troy Cross emphasized the data showed people didn’t lean entirely toward gold when given a balanced choice between the two assets. Younger participants were more open to larger Bitcoin allocations , which aligns with previous findings linking age and Bitcoin ownership. Dennis Porter, co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, noted the survey reflects Americans’ growing indifference toward gold and their general preference for diversified investment strategies. Currently, the U.S. owns over 8,133 tons of gold, valued at more than $830 billion, while its Bitcoin holdings stand at roughly 207,189 BTC—just under 3% of the gold's value. There's significant room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a plan to use profits from gold reserves to buy Bitcoin, possibly acquiring up to 1 million BTC over five years . This idea supports a proposal from Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025. Robert F.

While stocks and gold struggled, Bitcoin showed strength. Ethereum led the charge in altcoins, up 5%, while Solana, XRP, BNB, and Dogecoin climbed 2-4%. Golden Cross Signals Rally, But Is Death Cross Here? Experts have observed that Bitcoin is about to form a “golden cross”, a classic bullish indicator that could kick off a strong rally in the next few days. The last two times it happened, Bitcoin surged 121% and 68%. All eyes are now on Bitcoin if it could reach $110K soon ,and altcoins might perform even better. However, Analyst Benjamin Cowen has analyzed a different pattern. He noticed that every time Bitcoin goes through a “death cross”, that is when the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day, it often hits a local low right around then. This happened in Q3 of both 2023 and 2024, and again in Q2 this year (2025). Now, he warns that if Q3 is weak again this year, Bitcoin could dip one more time and more downside might be coming. Is Bitcoin Losing Strength? Analyst Ali Martinez also pointed out that Bitcoin might be losing strength after facing strong resistance. Momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD are showing signs of weakness, which shows the momentum is fading even as the price rises. On the flip side, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a massive $667 million inflow on May 19, the biggest in over two weeks, which shows strong institutional interest is back. Data from Farside Investors shows that the spot BTC ETFs have recorded inflows in 18 out of 21 days, bringing in $6.9 billion in capital in just three weeks. Markets Look Balanced According to a latest analysis by Cryptoquant , Bitcoin’s latest rebound looks healthier than past rallies. In earlier bull runs, when Bitcoin hit new highs, it quickly overheated, then crashed soon after. But this time, Bitcoin is bouncing back with no warning signs, the buying activity and market conditions look balanced. So Bitcoin could keep going up without dropping. This shows that the market is building strength steadily and not just rushing through hype and Bitcoin could break its all-time high again more sustainably this time.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-eyes-110k-next-etf-inflows-golden-cross-fuel-bullish-momentum/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Will Cole, the son-in-law of Senator Cynthia Lummis, recently reignited controversy by openly slamming XRP and its parent company Ripple, calling the project a “centralized joke of a scam.” Cole, who has been vocal in the past, doubled down on his criticism by claiming Ripple’s security fraud troubles are only the tip of the iceberg. He also took direct aim at the company’s leadership, accusing Ripple’s founders of being excessively greedy and dishonest about their connection to the XRP token. Why Senator Lummis Might Be Avoiding Ripple? Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan weighed in and said that if Senator Lummis shares even a fraction of her son-in-law’s views, it could explain her recent avoidance of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Recently, Brad Garlinghouse had planned to meet Senator Cynthia Lummis in Washington, D.C. to discuss crypto regulations, but she cancelled and hasn’t rescheduled. To this, Brad expressed his disappointment, since Lummis plays a major role in shaping crypto policy as head of the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee. Morgan speculated that a public meeting with Garlinghouse could invite backlash within her political and personal circles, potentially triggering accusations of favoritism or conflicts of interest — something politicians are typically keen to avoid. Some in the crypto community called her out for favoring Bitcoin and not supporting a level playing field for all digital assets. But Bitcoin proponents, like Troy Cross, praised her for “keeping the scammers at bay,” showing distrust toward XRP. Bitcoiners Slam XRP as “Fake Token” Targeting Retail Investors Adding to the debate, Pierre Rochard, CEO of Catholic Bitcoin, took a shot at Garlinghouse, saying that he ruined his reputation by backing CBDCs and attacking Bitcoin. He called his comments childish and said that the crypto space needs more serious leaders. Also, Cole has recently reshared some strong critiques of XRP from Pierre Rochard, highlighting that holding XRP could be a major mistake. He believes that XRP isn’t a serious asset for institutions and even calls it a “fake token” targeting retail investors. Earlier, Bitcoiners were upset when President Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve for the US that included XRP among several other altcoins. JAN3 CEO Samson Mow slammed the move, calling it “ hypershitcoinization ,” accusing the reserve of enriching project founders like Ripple, Vitalik Buterin, and others. All these comments show how some key voices in the crypto community still remain very skeptical about XRP’s value and legitimacy.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/political-insider-calls-xrp-a-scam-ripple-ceo-meeting-with-senator-lummis-canceled/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","News",cryptocompare

Spot XRP ETF could come soon The launch of CME’s XRP futures has made analysts a little more optimistic about a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. According to Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, the debut of XRP futures at CME makes a spot ETF approval more likely, saying on social media that it’s “only a matter of time.” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that eight spot XRP ETFs are currently under review by the SEC.

Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time.The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Coinbase also has an agreement with Circle to put USDC onto its exchange.Circle filed for an IPO on April 1 with a goal to complete the process by the end of that month.

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart.

The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls.

If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus.

2025-05-19T17:17:19.000Z,"Bitcoin ignores Moody’s US debt downgrade, rallies back to $105K after profit-taking sell-off","Key takeaways:Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts.

This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-19T05:06:21.000Z,"Coinbase faces lawsuit over alleged breaches of Illinois biometric privacy law","A group of Coinbase users from Illinois have filed a class-action lawsuit against the crypto exchange, alleging that its identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged. The complaint said Coinbase requires users to verify their identity by uploading a government-issued photo ID and a selfie, which is then sent to a third-party facial recognition software to scan and extract facial geometry. This process captures biometric identifiers without users’ informed written consent, which the suit claimed violates BIPA.Coinbase ID verification procedures.
