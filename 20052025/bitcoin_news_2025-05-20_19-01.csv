2025-05-20T16:55:41.000Z,"Man Faces Multiple Charges in Alleged $350,000 Check Kiting Scam Targeting US Banks","A 42-year-old man from Connecticut has been taken into custody for his alleged role in a check fraud ring that stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from US banks. In a website post, the Connecticut State Police say they’ve arrested and charged Eric J. Christian with violating the Corrupt Organizations & Racketeering Act, conspiracy to commit first-degree larceny, fraudulent use of an ATM, illegal possession of a personal identification information device, issuing a bad check between $500-$1,000, conspiracy to commit third-degree identity theft and third-degree forgery. Police accuse Christian of participation in a check-kiting crew that defrauded US banks. Authorities say the thieves wrote bad checks from bank accounts with little to no money and deposited them into other accounts, making it appear that the funds existed. They would subsequently withdraw the funds before the check bounced. Christian has allegedly been recruiting individuals since 2020 to open accounts at various banks to facilitate the check fraud scheme. Evidence in the arrest warrant shows the fraud scheme caused banks to lose more than $350,000, but authorities say the actual figure is believed to be much higher. Six other individuals have also been arrested in connection with the case, with the expectation of more arrests. Christian is slated to appear in a Superior Court on May 22nd.

2025-05-20T16:50:56.000Z,"Americans want to ditch gold reserves for Bitcoin? New survey raises eyebrows","A survey by the Nakamoto Project attracted criticism after indicating that 8 out of 10 Americans want the U.S. to sell some of its gold reserves to buy Bitcoin. The U.S. crypto reserve continues to be a divisive issue, as revealed by the reactions to one recent survey. On May 20, the Nakamoto Project, a pro-Bitcoin (BTC) non-profit organization, claimed that one in four Americans want the U.S. to convert at least some of its gold reserves into Bitcoin. However, the findings quickly raised questions about the survey’s methodology. You might also like: Bitcoin, gold rise while stocks fall: is decoupling here to stay? Troy Cross, Chief Editor at the Nakamoto Project, explained that the survey had 3,345 respondents. These were selected to match the U.S. census by key demographic points, including age, gender, and race, to ensure the results were representative. Nakamoto Project survey on converting gold reserves to Bitcoin | Source: X Respondents were asked what percentage of gold reserves the U.S. should convert into Bitcoin. They were given a slider to select any value between 0% and 100% to indicate their answer. “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?,” was the exact survey question. You might also like: Bitcoin price target if its market cap matched that of gold Bitcoin reserve survey criticized for leading question The methodology quickly drew scrutiny, even within crypto circles. Many criticized the use of a slider and suggested that a yes-or-no question would have been more meaningful. Jan Wüstenfeld, lead researcher at Melanion GreenTech, called the design “unfortunate.” “The way you framed it and set it up, you effectively pushed people to answer with a non-zero allocation,” Wüstenfeld wrote. “You say it yourself: People are reluctant to set a slider at zero.” Nakamoto Project’s Troy Cross acknowledged the framing effects, but pointed out that the survey still gave valuable results. For instance, younger people favored bigger allocations, while women recommended smaller allocations than men.

2025-05-20T16:41:37.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction: Ripple-Circle Stablecoin Deal Rumors Emerge – $1,000 XRP Incoming?","Rumors of a potential acquisition of Circle Internet Financial — the firm behind the USDC stablecoin — have injected fresh momentum into XRP, sparking a 5% price jump and strengthening the bullish XRP price prediction . Still, the news may not be fully priced in. XRP has since retraced to $2.35, alongside a 25% drop in trading volume in the 24 hours following the report. With many investors remaining on the sidelines and competing bidders in the mix, it has not yet made a compelling case as the best crypto to buy . Better-than-expected April inflation data have lifted sentiment, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s reluctance on rate cuts has tempered risk appetite, leaving the market cautiously optimistic. Ripple Wants Circle, But it Faces Tough Competition While Circle is still committed to going public, Fortune-reported informal talks with Coinbase and Ripple suggest it is exploring multiple paths. Sources from the banking and private equity sector say Circle is seeking at least $5 billion, the same valuation it is targeting for the IPO. Ripple has already made a bid in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion , but that offer was turned down as too low, according to Bloomberg. With a shared history dating back to 2018 through the Centre Consortium—a venture to establish fiat-backed stablecoins, including USDC—Coinbase is seen as the natural buyer. Though the consortium dissolved in 2023, Coinbase retains an equity stake in Circle and continues to share in the USDC revenue. Looks like Coinbase is trying to move in on Ripple’s plans… Looks like Coinbase is now interested in Circle USDC. However in my opinion I think Ripple got this… XRP RLUSD XLM USDC all under The Ripple Umbrella ——> USA Treasury pic.twitter.com/G93NsGmEpB — Remi In The System (@RemiRelief2) May 19, 2025 XRP Price Prediction: Could Ripple-Circle Pave the Way to $1000? Ripple Labs would likely integrate USDC into the XRP Ledger network, providing access to a sector expected to grow from $248 billion $2 trillion by 2030, according to Citigroup projections . Such an integration could significantly boost XRP Ledger transaction volumes, increasing the burn rate and utility demand for XRP. This would support long-term XRP price growth with deflationary pressure. However, in the near-term price action is likely to be defined by the breakout from the falling wedge pattern that has defined the multi-month XRP price downtrend. Momentum has faltered post-breakout, with the Rupple price now retesting the pattern’s former resistance as support. Crossing below this could invalidate the pattern completely. If momentum continues, the pattern sets an XRP price breakout target around $4 before the end of the year, representing a potential 70% surge from current prices. This outlook is supported by the MACD, which continues to lead above the signal line—often an early sign of a sustained mid-term trend. More so, the RSI holds in bullish territory above the neutral line at 50, though the balance remains delicate. Buying pressure continues to lead higher timeframes. The ongoing retest of past support at $2.20 in line with the 0.5 Fib retracement level—a common reversal zone—could mark a correction bottom if bulls fail to defend the current level. Looking further ahead, June 17 presents a major catalyst with the decision deadline on US XRP spot ETFs. Alongside a Ripple-Circle deal, the coveted $1,000 XRP price prediction could be in focus for the coming years. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially with the market in a state of cautious optimism. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones, starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $6 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 68% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-05-20T16:37:35.000Z,"Exploring The Meme Coin Ecosystem Beyond Husky Inu (HINU)","The crypto market is witnessing a significant uptick as major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), registered stunning rallies to cross key levels. BTC reclaimed $100,000 and crossed $105,000 this week, while ETH reclaimed the crucial $2,500 level. With cryptocurrencies rallying, investors are looking for low-cost, alternative investment options to enter the market. This is where meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Husky Inu (HINU) come into the picture. What Is Husky Inu (HINU)? Husky Inu (HINU) is the Solana Network’s latest meme coin offering. The fledgling project has created quite a furor in the meme coin ecosystem, positioning itself as an alternative to established meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and Dogwifhat (WIF). Husky Inu plans to conquer the meme coin ecosystem and build a supportive community offering enhanced rewards and innovative features. The project has completed its pre-sale and is in the middle of its pre-launch phase. The pre-launch phase has seen the HINU token price increase every two days. The token’s current price is $0.00017376, and the project has raised $762,568, as it gets closer to the $1.2 million milestone. Sizing Up The Competition Let’s look at the meme coins Husky Inu is set to go head-to-head with. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest meme coin by market capitalization, giving it an incumbent advantage over others. It was also one of the first cryptocurrencies created, made as a spoof on Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013. Investors who bought DOGE at its launch and HODL-ed made a significant profit. The meme coin became quite popular at launch, with the token and its blockchain having several use cases. Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021, making it one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Dogecoin has several high-profile backers and an enthusiastic community. However, none can match the profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the project’s most high-profile backer. Musk has taken the initiative to champion the token, putting it miles ahead of the competition and helping power significant gains for the asset. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest meme coins to enter the market. The project hopes to establish itself in the meme coin ecosystem and bring more value and utility to token holders and supporters by leveraging the Solana blockchain. The project and its native HINU token also hope to establish a strong and supportive community with enhanced rewards and innovative features. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) was a phenomenon in the meme coin ecosystem, setting itself apart from other players through its distinctive fusion of humor and ingenuity. The meme coin was inspired by the internet meme Doge, injecting a fresh twist into the meme-centric crypto landscape. The token has garnered a lively community around itself and has gained considerable traction in the crypto and meme coin ecosystem.

2025-05-20T16:32:25.000Z,"A Response to Bitcoin Maximalists Attacking XRP","In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, it’s not uncommon to see spirited debates between communities advocating for different cryptocurrencies. But sometimes, what begins as a technical discussion devolves into tribalism. This is exactly what prompted the latest rebuttal from the All Things XRP community, following a post by Bitcoin advocate Pierre Rochard, who referenced an early quirk in XRP Ledger’s history as a subtle dig at its legitimacy. In a tweet captioned simply “Sir,” Rochard highlighted a snippet from the XRP Ledger documentation explaining that due to a mishap in the ledger’s early days, the first 32,569 ledgers were lost. As a result, ledger #32,570 is the earliest available on record. The post went on to explain that a reset to index zero would have caused significant disruption, so ledger #32,570 was adopted as the de facto “genesis” ledger. While factually accurate, the underlying tone of Rochard’s post struck a nerve with many XRP supporters, who saw it not as a technical insight but as yet another veiled jab from the Bitcoin maximalist camp. In response, All Things XRP delivered a powerful and eloquent rebuttal, emphasizing unity, pragmatism, and the need to move past the toxic tribalism that has held the broader crypto community back for far too long. Beyond Tribalism: Crypto Isn’t a Zero-Sum Game The All Things XRP response opens with an important reminder: this space is big enough for everyone. Supporting one project doesn’t have to mean undermining another. Many XRP supporters, including those responding to Rochard, have cheered for Bitcoin’s success from the beginning. Not because they think XRP should be subordinated, but because Bitcoin’s rise has lifted the entire industry. A healthy, growing Bitcoin often signals robust investor confidence in crypto as a whole. A RESPONSE TO BITCOIN MAXIS ATTACKING XRP. I’m all for healthy debate in crypto, but the constant attacks on XRP from folks like @BitcoinPierre need addressing. I’m rooting for Bitcoin to win. Always have. Why? Because a rising tide lifts all boats. Crypto isn’t a zero-sum… pic.twitter.com/0HHLquT5QU — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 20, 2025 However, the frequent and often unwarranted attacks on XRP from staunch Bitcoin supporters suggest a different perspective—one rooted in a zero-sum mentality. This scarcity mindset proposes that only one chain can thrive in the long run. Not only is that idea fundamentally flawed, but it’s also dangerous. It inhibits innovation and distracts from the real mission of the crypto movement: building decentralized technologies that solve real-world problems. No Chain Is Without Flaws The All Things XRP rebuttal does not shy away from acknowledging XRP Ledger’s early history. Yes, there was a mishap, and yes, the first week’s worth of ledger data is no longer available. But is that reason enough to dismiss the entire project? If historical mishaps disqualify legitimacy, then Bitcoin, too, should be under scrutiny. Take, for instance, Bitcoin’s infamous overflow bug in 2010. Due to a coding error, over 184 billion BTC were minted in a single transaction—an amount vastly exceeding Bitcoin’s total supply cap of 21 million. The bug was quickly patched, but it serves as a poignant reminder that no blockchain, no matter how venerated, is perfect. Mistakes happen. What matters is how communities respond and build resilient systems going forward. XRP has done just that. Despite its early ledger loss, the network operates smoothly, with all states accurately recorded across versions. Its design remains robust enough to serve real-world applications today, processing billions of dollars in cross-border payments and enterprise-level transactions globally. It’s a story of adaptation, not failure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Real-World Adoption Speaks Louder Than Smear Campaigns Another point of emphasis from the All Things XRP community is XRP’s undeniable traction in institutional circles. Ripple, the leading company building on the XRP Ledger, has formed partnerships with hundreds of financial institutions worldwide. Their infrastructure powers a large volume of cross-border payments , remittances, and liquidity provisioning, especially in regions where traditional banking systems are slow or expensive. It’s easy to mock from the sidelines, but data doesn’t lie. While critics post sarcastic tweets, Ripple continues to ship products and expand its reach. That’s the essence of technological progress: shipping code, not just commentary. Focus on What Unites, Not What Divides Ultimately, the All Things XRP response calls for a redirection of energy. Instead of perpetuating cycles of ridicule and one-upmanship, the crypto space would benefit far more from collaborative efforts and mutual respect. There’s a wide field of opportunity still unexplored. Layer-1s and layer-2s alike are racing to bring decentralization to real-world finance, identity systems, gaming, and more. The adversaries are not other projects, but the outdated systems crypto seeks to replace. Pierre Rochard, like many Bitcoin maximalists, is certainly entitled to his views. But when those views contribute to division instead of discourse, they risk becoming obstacles to progress. The crypto movement was never meant to be a battlefield of ideologies, but a cooperative frontier of ideas. XRP’s early ledger history is a footnote, not a fatal flaw. Its practical utility, institutional integration, and strong developer base make it one of the most viable digital assets in circulation today. Attempts to reduce its legacy to a lost week of data reflect more on the narrowness of the critic’s perspective than the strength of the project. Crypto is not a war of attrition. It is a collaborative revolution. And as All Things XRP so aptly put it, it’s time we stopped fighting over scraps and started building the future together.

2025-05-20T16:22:14.000Z,"Trump Crypto Executive Order Impact Study: Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as Prime Beneficiary for Retail Investors","Following President Trump’s March 2025 executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, retail investors are now looking for ways to meaningfully participate in the nation’s evolving crypto landscape. Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as a standout opportunity, delivering real-time token rewards through mobile mining, a capped supply model, and user-first infrastructure — making it highly aligned with the core values being adopted at the federal level. The executive order, which formally designates Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, lays out plans for the US government to maintain its holdings indefinitely. Additional BTC will be acquired through budget-neutral strategies, and no sell-off is planned. This represents a significant institutional endorsement of decentralized assets — and Bitcoin Solaris mirrors these principles through its own fixed-supply, infrastructure-first design that empowers individuals, not just institutions. Direct Protocol Participation Through Mobile Mining Bitcoin Solaris enables users to mine BTC-S tokens passively via the Nova App, using just a smartphone. Participants allocate a small amount of device storage (1–5 GB) and idle CPU, allowing the app to operate quietly in the background. Unlike validator-based systems or speculative tokens, mining on Bitcoin Solaris requires no technical knowledge or staking capital. Rewards are earned daily based on actual network contribution. Behind this system is a dual-layer blockchain architecture built for scale and accessibility: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) for secure, low-energy consensus. The Solaris Layer operates using Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to support mobile mining and contract logic with 10,000+ TPS and 2-second finality. This architecture allows for seamless, protocol-level income without the costs and barriers that have historically defined mining ecosystems. Earning Begins Before Public Access Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million BTC-S (20%) are allocated to presale participants. There will be no inflation or further token issuance beyond what is distributed through the protocol’s mining and validator mechanisms. This presale phase provides early access to BTC-S before broader mining competition and exchange listings elevate demand. The structure rewards early participation, much like the incentive model that allowed early Bitcoin miners to benefit from protocol-driven scarcity — now made accessible to any smartphone owner. In a timely breakdown, HotCuppaCrypto explores how Bitcoin Solaris fits within the policy changes driven by Trump’s crypto executive order. The video details how Nova App mining provides real protocol access to individuals, even as the government prioritizes institutional Bitcoin accumulation. Security Confirmed by Independent Audits To support transparency and user trust, Bitcoin Solaris has completed extensive third-party audits and verification: Cyberscope Audit : Reviewed contract emissions, mining protocols, and smart contract reliability. Freshcoins Audit : Verified mining logic and overall scalability. KYC Verification : Confirmed team credentials and governance structure. These audits ensure BTC-S tokens are distributed securely under clearly defined protocol rules — aligning with broader trends of digital asset standardization. President Trump’s executive order represents a pivotal shift in US digital asset policy. But while institutions focus on reserves, Bitcoin Solaris empowers the retail segment — delivering mobile-based, protocol-native rewards through mining and a fixed-supply model. Now in Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it offers the most accessible entry point for users to participate in the developing crypto market.

2025-05-20T16:20:06.000Z,"Genesis’ New Lawsuits Target DCG Officials Over Lost Crypto Funds","Genesis Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), the company responsible for overseeing Genesis’s bankruptcy, has filed two new lawsuits. These legal actions target Genesis’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), its CEO, Barry Silbert, and other top executives. The lawsuits claim that billions of dollars were wrongly taken from Genesis before the company went bankrupt in 2023. Genesis Sues DCG for Funds Mismanagement and Deception The first lawsuit was filed in Delaware. It says Barry Silbert and his team recklessly ran Genesis. The complaint accuses them of misleading customers about the company’s financial health while taking money for their benefit. It also claimed the company’s officials moved money from Genesis to other parts of DCG, even when they knew the company was in trouble. Although Grayscale Investments, another company owned by DCG, was mentioned in the complaint, it was not named as a defendant. In this lawsuit, Genesis asks the court to help recover at least $2.2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other crypto assets. These funds would then be returned to the creditors still waiting to be paid. This class action comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged DCG and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro. In January, the agency claimed the company misled investors, with the case ending with a $38.5 million settlement. DCG Accused of Moving $1B From Genesis Before Collapse Another lawsuit was filed in New York’s Bankruptcy Court. It claimed that DCG and its insiders moved over $1 billion in cash and crypto out of Genesis while the company collided. The suit says these transfers took place when Genesis was already facing serious financial risks, especially after the crash of Terra-Luna. It also revealed that the firm had $14 billion in loans and was already insolvent by the end of 2021. According to the filing, a financial consulting firm warned DCG about these risks in November 2021, but no action was taken to fix the problems. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January 2023. At that time, it owed money to over 100,000 people and businesses, with total debts reaching as high as $10 billion. The company completed its restructuring process in August 2024 and has since started returning money to creditors. So far, Genesis has paid back more than $4 billion in assets. DCG Responds to the Lawsuits DCG has denied all the claims. A company spokesperson said the lawsuits are not new and that the accusations have been made before. It was also revealed that DCG worked with many people during the bankruptcy process to find a fair solution. The company says it will strongly defend itself against unfair and false accusations.

2025-05-20T16:18:50.000Z,"Elon Musk and Bitcoin: Ownership, Influence, and Crypto Myths","Elon Musk, Bitcoin, and the Power of Influence Billionaire entrepreneur and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become one of the world's most influential voices in cryptocurrency. His Twitter posts, interviews, and business actions can send bitcoin prices skyward or plummeting in a matter of minutes. But beyond the headlines, many people wonder: how much bitcoin does Elon Musk own, does Elon Musk own bitcoin at all, and is Elon Musk giving away bitcoin as some viral posts claim? How Much Bitcoin Does Elon Musk Own? The extent of bitcoin that Elon Musk controls has been the subject of outlandish speculation for years. Musk has personally confirmed his own holdings of bitcoin, but he has never publicly stated precisely how much he controls. In a tweet in 2018, he described how someone had sent him a small amount about 0.25 BTC — for laughs and that was all that he then controlled. But since that time, he has ramped up his bitcoin activity, and it's widely believed that his own holdings have expanded, especially inasmuch as he has been a big supporter of the cryptocurrency. What is publicly known is that Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have each had significant amounts of bitcoin on their books. Early in 2021, Tesla became global news after investing $1.5 billion in bitcoin, a development that triggered a rally in the cryptocurrency's price and led other businesses to look at similar investments. Tesla's holdings of bitcoin were as high as 40,000 BTC at its peak. However, Tesla sold its bitcoin holdings by as much as 75% during 2022 due to the desire to maximize cash liquidity amid uncertain economic times. As of early 2025, Tesla is reported to still hold over 11,000 BTC and is thus a leading corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Details on the holdings of SpaceX are shakier. Musk has confirmed that SpaceX holds bitcoin, but the company has not released any particular figures. Some estimate SpaceX's holdings at tens of millions of dollars, but confirmation is lacking. Yes, Elon Musk does own bitcoin. He has continued saying so himself, on Twitter and in public conversation. In July 2021, when he spoke about his personal crypto portfolio at ”The B Word” conference, he openly spoke about being a holder of bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. He has also explained why he owns bitcoin, calling it an inflation hedge and a store of value. Musk's investment in bitcoin is more than an individual investment. He has influenced company policy at Tesla and led the firm to make its historic bitcoin buy. For a brief time in 2021, Tesla even accepted bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, though the company later eliminated this option due to concern over the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining. Musk has been quoted since then on how Tesla would consider taking bitcoin again if mining is made more environmentally friendly. His public support of bitcoin has made him a hero to many in the crypto community, but it has also attracted criticism and attention. A few say that Musk's tweets and public remarks can be too influential, causing unwarranted market instability. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Elon Musk has bitcoin and remains an influencer in the crypto space. Is Elon Musk Giving Away Bitcoin? One of the longest-lived myths in the crypto space is that Elon Musk is offering a bitcoin giveaway. The myth has been fueled by millions of social media tweets, YouTube videos, and even reported livestreams claiming Musk is offering a bitcoin giveaway. All of them are actually scams. Scammers often use deepfake technology, tampered videos, or hacked social media accounts to impersonate Musk and spread false giveaways. The overall strategy asks the users to send a small amount of bitcoin to a specified address with guarantees they receive double or triple their amount in return. Unfortunately, the victims never receive their money. Musk and his businesses have repeatedly warned the public about these scams. Tesla, SpaceX, and Musk himself have issued official statements stating that he and his businesses are not issuing bitcoin or running any type of crypto giveaway. If you see a post or video claiming otherwise, it is likely a scam. The Impact of Elon Musk's Tweets and Market Moves Elon Musk's association with bitcoin goes beyond being mere personal or business ownership. His market power is profound. A single tweet from Musk can increase or decrease bitcoin's price within minutes. For example, when Musk announced that Tesla had made its first purchase of bitcoin, bitcoin's price surged to new all-time highs. However, when he raised concerns about the environmental viability of bitcoin, the price fell. This incident, also called ”The Musk Effect,” goes to show the extent of impact that celebrity personalities have in the still new and volatile crypto market. While some investors appreciate Musk's transparency and commitment to engaging with the community, others worry that his power has a tendency to bring about volatile price action and greater risk for retail traders. Musk's tweets have also spawned a wave of ”meme coins” and copycat projects, some of which have found success merely because he gave them a name. The dynamic has generated hype and cynicism among the crypto community, as investors are seeking to separate genuine innovation from speculative mania. The Risks of Celebrity Crypto Scams The wave of fake scams stating that Elon Musk is giving away free bitcoin is a caution about the dangers of celebrity frenzy in the crypto world. Scammers are riding on Musk's fame and the fact that people have faith in his brand to get people to send them money. The scams have become so large in scale that cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies have sounded several alarms. To protect yourself, always verify information against credible sources. Neither Elon Musk nor his companies are running bitcoin giveaways. If you're sent a post, livestream, or message claiming otherwise, it is most likely a scam. Never send bitcoin or any other currency to a stranger, even if they promise to send you more in return. Conclusion: Fact, Fiction, and the Future Elon Musk's interest in bitcoin is complex, compelling, and often misguided. While he does own some bitcoin and has directed his businesses to invest in the cryptocurrency, he does not disclose how much. Although rumors continue to circulate, Elon Musk isn't giving away bitcoin, and any claims to the contrary are frauds. Musk's influence in the marketplace cannot be disputed. His tweets and business moves can move billions of dollars in a matter of minutes, and his bitcoin approvals have made cryptocurrency mainstream. But with great influence there must be great responsibility — and risk. As the crypto market expands, investors need to be cautious, do their own research, and beware of scams that capitalize on celebrity names. In the end, the story of Elon Musk and bitcoin is a reminder of both the promise and the peril of the digital asset revolution. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newcomer, staying informed and cautious is the best way to navigate this ever-evolving landscape.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9202/elon-musk-and-bitcoin-ownership-influence-and-crypto-myths,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T16:17:27.000Z,"How security and compliance can bring institutions to DeFi","Talk about a buzzword—decentralized finance, or DeFi, gets thrown around a lot as the next big thing set to shake up how money works. And yeah, the core ideas—open access for everyone, transparent transaction trails, new ways to earn—are pretty exciting. But if DeFi wants to break out of its current (though growing) crypto corner and become a real player in mainstream finance, it needs to convince the institutions, the big-money players, to jump in. Those institutions? They like DeFi’s potential, sure. Who wouldn’t be interested in new efficiencies and bit returns? DeFi’s “trustless” setup, where smart contracts replace intermediaries, sounds great, but it can also look risky from their perspective. They see the massive potential, but they also see the news flashes about hacks, stolen funds, and fuzzy regulations. Regulatory clarity will be a big driver for further institutional adoption of DeFi tech and investment and the US is looking to lead the way. Binance CEO Richard Teng was interviewed recently by UAE based publication The National while speaking at the Token2040 conference. Teng discussed his recent meeting with US officials about upcoming regulations: “The new efforts and optimism is very real in the US. So, I believe the US is going to come out with very enlightened, pro-industry and smart regulations that support the industry but also manages the risk at the same time. So you’re probably going to see some of the new legislation coming through by August this year.” For DeFi to really attract that next flood of serious capital, tightening up security and getting onboard with clear compliance rules isn’t just helpful—it’s absolutely critical. Big investors are already testing the crypto waters (including DeFi) Don’t get it twisted—institutional money is already dipping its toes into crypto, and DeFi is definitely catching their eye. We saw a huge sign of this back in March 2025. That’s when MGX, a big tech investment firm from Abu Dhabi, dropped a massive $2 billion into the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. That wasn’t just pocket change; it was the single largest investment ever in a crypto company, and notably, Binance’s first institutional investment—all paid in stablecoins. That headline-grabbing deal isn’t the only proof. Check the numbers from BitcoinTreasuries on May 7, 2025: institutional players are now holding over 12% of the total BTC supply. And a 2024 report from PwC and AIMA found something interesting: nearly half (47%) of the traditional hedge funds they surveyed were already dabbling in digital assets . That’s way up from 29% just the year before. Plus, a third of those already planned to put more money into crypto by the end of 2024. It seems they’re getting savvier, too. The same report showed traditional hedge funds are increasingly using derivatives (up to 58% in 2024 from 38% in 2023) rather than just buying crypto directly. On top of that, the arrival of regulated spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, especially in the US, has been a game-changer. These ETFs pulled in over $44 billion globally in their first year alone, giving institutions a familiar, regulated way to get involved. You also see big banks like Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan , and Citi experimenting with putting real-world assets like bonds onto the blockchain. The interest is definitely real. But DeFi needs to clean up its act for the next big leap Okay, so the interest is there. But for DeFi specifically to grab a bigger share of that institutional money, it has to tackle some major issues head-on, mostly around keeping funds safe and playing by the rules. Let’s be frank: the decentralized finance space has been a bit like the Wild West when it comes to hacks and exploits. Massive losses, like the $1.4 billion Bybit hack (caused by weak transfer security and risky ‘blind signing’), make institutions think twice, maybe three times, before parking millions in DeFi protocols. The constant worry about smart contract bugs or validator mistakes leading to theft is a huge deterrent. It’s not just about preventing theft, either. The regulatory picture is still pretty murky and inconsistent globally. As the lawyers at Guha PLLC noted, different US agencies often have conflicting ideas about how rules apply, creating “treacherous waters” for anyone trying to stay compliant. Institutions need clear, predictable rules. They need to know they’re dealing with platforms that take AML and KYC rules seriously—things that DeFi’s open-access nature doesn’t always easily align with. Building that institutional trust is job number one. DeFi platforms can’t just be built for crypto wizards; they need user interfaces that make sense for traditional finance pros. Things like integrating solid blockchain analytics tools to monitor transactions in real-time and flag shady activity are essential for AML compliance. New ideas are popping up too, like intent-based architecture, which tries to make transactions safer by default—reducing risks like MEV exploitation (where bots front-run trades) and making sure deals only happen when everyone’s conditions are met. The potential payoff is enormous. Analysts at the Boston Consulting Group think the market for tokenized real-world assets could hit $16 trillion by 2030 , and DeFi could be central to that. If DeFi players truly want to see those institutional billions flow their way, they have a clear to-do list: make security ironclad, demystify the compliance journey, and create user experiences that sophisticated financial firms expect. Pulling that off won’t be easy; it’ll need a real team effort from the tech folks, the regulators, and the institutions. But getting this right is how DeFi moves from being just “disruptive” to being genuinely safe and reliable for everyone.

2025-05-20T16:08:52.000Z,"Solaxy Fades as Bitcoin Pepe Announces Major May Exchange Listings","In less than 11 days, the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, Bitcoin Pepe , hits center stage, and traders are circling like hawks. Meanwhile, over in the Solana camp, Solaxy is showing signs of fatigue after raising a solid $37M. Respectable for sure, but in a market that runs on energy and headlines, investors are starting to squint. With BTC now back above 100k, what we’re seeing presently is a vibe shift. Traders, degens, and even a few BTC maxis are turning toward meme-driven rockets with real market punch. With Solaxy’s presale fatigue, delayed mainnet, and slow pace, it’s quite a tough sell when traders want action yesterday. So now the race is on, not just to raise capital or launch products, but to stay relevant in a market with a short attention span and an even shorter fuse. Here’s what you need to know! Bitcoin Pepe: Solana speed, Bitcoin bones, meme coin 1000x potential What happens when you jam Solana’s speed into Bitcoin’s raw, battle-tested security? You get Bitcoin Pepe, Bitcoin’s Trojan horse. Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 brings BTC back to life. It is building out real infrastructure, a full-on DeFi platform, NFTs, staking, the works. Gas fees that don’t induce an anxiety attack and transactions that actually feel instant, all on Bitcoin this time, not Ethereum or Solana. The PEP-20 token standard means that now everyone and their cousin can spin up tokens right on BTC. This could be a protocol upgrade paving the way for a full-blown meme coin stampede. Bitcoin, which has long been viewed as a boomer asset and referred to as gold 2.0, will now feature a layer 2 solution that offers Solana-like performance, positioning it to become the hub for degens and everything that retail investors desire. It’s trading built for Zoomers, locked onto the chain Boomers still trust. And this time, everyone’s invited. Solaxy vs Bitcoin Pepe: Which one is the best investment opportunity? Solaxy started strong, without question, but the presale’s almost topped out, and unless you got in early, the upside’s already thinning out. A layer 2 built on Solana is surely noteworthy, but lately, things have slowed. Solaxy’s presale is wrapping up, price movement has mellowed out, and everyone’s now eyeing the mainnet, still in the works. The roadmap is all about long-term utility, but rewards feel far off, and the hype is running cold. On the other hand, Bitcoin Pepe is sprinting through milestones, with over $10.3m already raised. Tier-1 listings are locked in, and with only a few days left until the big launch on 31st May, the vibe is pure FOMO. There’s actual utility, with rewards, staking, and the first-ever meme coin infrastructure built natively on Bitcoin. BPEP is perfectly wedged between BTC’s resurgence and the market’s appetite for volatility. If Solana could do 1000x without Bitcoin behind it… Imagine what happens when meme coins, NFTs, and all things DeFi run on BTC. Bitcoin Pepe could slam this cycle home Right now, the crowd is chasing speed, hype, and immediate upside. Bitcoin Pepe , the world's only Bitcoin meme ICO, meets all these criteria. To put it simply, PEP-20 is uncharted territory on crypto’s most trusted blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe could be precisely what BTC needs to break through and stay above the ATH. Analysts are already throwing around words like “Cambrian explosion” for Bitcoin this year, expected to outperform gold for the rest of 2025. It’s no secret that BTC has become the institutional favorite, but meme culture is how you bring the masses back in. Bitcoin Pepe is going live on May 31st, and its current price of $0.0359 may be the last time it's this cheap, this early, and off the radar.

2025-05-20T16:00:59.000Z,"Why is Ethereum (ETH) price up today?","Key takeaways: Ether’s price rose over 5% to $2,520 on May 20, mirroring similar upward moves across the wider cryptocurrency market. Ethereum’s record open interest, rising funding rates and a significant short squeeze fuel the rally. A classic recovery pattern suggests a potential 92% rally toward $4,800 as ETH holds key support. Ether ( ETH ) price rose by over 5% in the last 24 hours to around $2,520 on May 20 amid increasing futures open interest. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows ETH gained as much as 10%, rising to an intraday high of $2,590 on May 20 from a low of $2,350 on May 19. ETHUSD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Ether price move mirrors marketwide recovery ETH’s price rise on May 20 mirrors the bullish sentiment in the market that has seen crypto prices recover across the board. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has risen 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $105,000. While other major altcoins such as XRP ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ) rose by 1.4% and 3.3%, respectively. 24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360 Similarly, the total crypto market cap has increased by 2.2% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.33 trillion at the time of publication. This performance comes as a positive sentiment remained in the cryptocurrency market despite Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit score , which saw equities drop and gold extend its downtrend. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies have held their ground, with Bitcoin rallying as high as $107,000 , producing the highest-ever daily candle close on Sunday, May 18. Ether followed suit, rallying to about $2,600 before retracing. “BTC’s ability to rally over the weekend despite a risk-off tone in equities following the Moody’s US credit rating downgrade” particularly stands out, said trading firm QCP Capital in a May 19 Telegram note to investors, adding: “This reinforces BTC’s positioning as a legitimate store of value, a narrative that continues to gather momentum and may serve as a long-term catalyst.” The firm pointed to consistent inflows into crypto investment products and institutional demand as catalysts, even as derivatives markets saw increased investor interest. Ether short squeeze and record OI boost ETH price Ether’s bullishness on May 20 is accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market, signaling strong upward pressure. Over $57.2 million worth of short ETH positions have been liquidated over the last 24 hours, compared to $22 million in long liquidations. Total ETH liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Since May 8, traders betting against Ether have been forced to close their positions, with approximately $913 million in short liquidations recorded, accompanying a 40% rise in price. At the same time, Ether’s open interest (OI), the total value of outstanding futures contracts, has increased sharply to an all-time high of 20.1 million ETH on May 20 from 11.76 million ETH on May 8. This indicates increased trading activity in the derivatives market. Ether’s OI across all exchanges.

Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric has increased to 0.0078% from $0.0012% over the same period. ETH funding rates across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass This rise in open interest shows more traders are entering the market and opening new positions. Higher funding rates indicate that more traders are going long (betting on higher prices) and are willing to pay extra fees to keep those positions open. Both metrics signal bullish bias among ETH futures traders. ETH price V-shaped recovery targets all-time highs Ether’s price has been forming a V-shaped recovery pattern on the weekly chart since December 2024, as shown below. A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline. ETH appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $2,600 and $2,800, where the 100-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMAs) sit. This suggests that bulls need to push the price above this area in order to increase the chances of the price rising to the neckline at $4,100 to complete the V-shaped pattern. Higher than that, the next logical move would be toward the 2021 all-time high of $4,800, representing a 92% increase from the current price. ETH/USD weekly chart.

2025-05-20T15:57:08.000Z,"Kraken: Just a Little XRP Can Cut Risk and Lift Returns","A recent report from Kraken Exchange highlights XRP as a valuable asset in diversified crypto portfolios. The report uses a data-driven framework that incorporates Monte Carlo simulations and efficient frontier modeling.At the time of this report, XRP was changing hands at $2.33, having declined from its weekly high of $2.66. The crypto has seen moderate fluctuations throughout the week, aligning with the broader market.However, amid these fluctuations, Kraken’s report used a framework called Monte Carlo simulations to gauge XRP's constructiveness. This statistical technique models and analyzes the behavior of complex systems that involve uncertainty and randomness.The report , titled “In a Portfolio of Digital Assets, XRP is Constructive,” concludes that even a modest allocation of 3.9% to XRP can improve overall portfolio efficiency. This level of exposure, determined within a minimum-variance framework, reportedly sustains annualized returns near 14% while also reducing portfolio volatility.The simulations, which tested thousands of market scenarios, provide statistical support for XRP’s risk-adjusted performance. The analysis highlights XRP’s value as a portfolio diversifier, given its moderate correlations with major layer-1 assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. By not moving in lockstep with these dominant cryptocurrencies, XRP helps smooth portfolio volatility, especially during periods of elevated market stress.Diversification and Risk Metrics Point to Strategic AllocationIn addition to lower correlation, Kraken’s research notes that XRP shows resilience during broad market drawdowns. Simulated portfolios with XRP included experienced shallower declines, suggesting reduced exposure to protocol-specific risks. This resilience, combined with XRP’s historical upside, including prior triple-digit monthly gains, strengthens its positioning as a contributor to improved risk-adjusted returns.Further, the report finds that small allocations to XRP lead to notable improvements in key portfolio performance metrics. Specifically, the Sharpe and Sortino ratios, used to measure risk-adjusted returns, show better results with XRP included. Kraken emphasizes that large capital commitments are not necessary. Even low-single-digit allocations provide the intended diversification and efficiency gains. These findings reflect a broader application of XRP in retail and institutional portfolio structures.Technical Analysis Supports Long-Term Price StructureMeanwhile, a separate analysis from analyst \""GalaxyBTC\"" outlines long-term technical patterns in XRP’s historical price cycles. The review identifies two major consolidation periods: the 2014–2017 cycle, which lasted about 1,267 days, and the ongoing 2018–2025 cycle, which spans approximately 2,471 days. Following the earlier consolidation, XRP surged from $0.0067 to $3.84 after breaking out and retesting its trendline.In early 2025, XRP mirrored this pattern by breaking out of the multi-year downtrend. As of now, XRP trades near $2.38. Galaxy suggests that this longer consolidation phase may lead to a stronger rally, with technical projections pointing toward a potential price target of $40, if historical structures repeat.

2025-05-20T15:48:31.000Z,"Why Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins","President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is set to become law, a move that some argue will increase U.S. deficits and debt while likely boosting Bitcoin and altcoin prices in the long term. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts Trump signed into law. It also introduces new tax measures he campaigned on, including a $1,000 tax credit for all children born in the country and exemptions for tips. It will also raise the estate tax exemption to $15 million. The “big, beautiful” bill will likely be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins for several reasons. Big, beautiful bill to boost Bitcoin and altcoins First, the bill is expected to increase the U.S. public debt and deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it will raise public debt by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years. It will also push the debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% to 125%, compared to 117% under current law. The surging debt comes as the U.S. has lost its last triple-A credit rating from Moody’s. S&P Global and Fitch Ratings downgraded the country’s rating in 2011 and 2023, respectively. Rising risks of a U.S. government default are considered bullish for Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a safe-haven asset. Many Bitcoin analysts, including BlackRock’s Larry Fink , believe that it is digital gold. In a recent white paper , BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a unique diversifier and that many investors are buying it to hedge against growing U.S. debt.

Second, the “big, beautiful bill” could also boost Bitcoin by introducing new tax breaks, increasing the disposable income of many Americans. More disposable income could lead some people to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins. A notable example occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when Americans used stimulus checks to purchase Bitcoin. Additionally, the bill will likely expand the M2 money supply in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve may be forced to print money to fund the growing deficit. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked the M2 money supply, albeit with a lag. Most altcoins then tend to follow Bitcoin’s price movements. https://twitter.com/TedPillows/status/1919421366799126899 Finally, the bill’s tax cuts and deregulation measures could help to offset the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs and help to reduce recession risks.

The privacy coin continued to grow, outperforming other assets, as demand returns. Monero (XMR) is making a return after posting a new peak for 2025 and the highest level for the past 12 months. XMR rose to $353.71 after weeks of gradual growth. The coin is now back to price levels not seen since 2021, setting up expectations for an even more active appreciation cycle.

The asset has limited exposure to mainstream exchanges after delistings but retains its influence as a privately mined coin. XMR gets a boost from Asian markets The recent exposure for Monero on social media does not immediately translate to increased global trading. There are several specifics around XMR that may cut the rally short. More than 50% of XMR volumes are on KuCoin and HTX, exchanges that are usually difficult to access for international traders. XMR is also traded on smaller markets with significant counterparty risk. The asset is mostly banned from US-based and EU brokerages and exchanges due to its anonymous origins and untraceable wallets. Exchanges may also have problems with XMR withdrawals and reserves in the case of real rising demand for the coin. Some market operators also use a tokenized version of Monero. The asset is difficult to track. In the past day of growth, the XMR/ETH pair on KuCoin also showed anomalous activity, with volumes rising by over 274% in a day. The XMR/ETH pair was also highly active at the end of April as the hacker tried to swap out assets, leading to peak volumes. The other activity hub for XMR was Kraken, where the busiest pair expanded its volumes by over 1,621%. The biggest shift came from the smaller market Bitrue, where XMR activity spiked by 10,000% in an otherwise low-liquidity pair. The available liquidity for XMR may still be low for a proper bull market. In the short term, XMR has often outperformed other altcoins and even BTC. The revival of XMR is not only in its market activity. Monero mining is at an all-time high, more than doubling since April 2024. The network hashrate grew exponentially in the past month, showing a trend of returning to the network as a source of newly mined privacy coins. Monero mining reached an all-time high, with exponential expansion in the past month. | Source: Coinwarz Miners produce only 432 XMR per day, comparable to the BTC mining reward. The coin remains scarce as exchanges carry insignificant balances. Acquiring XMR may be the most accessible for miners, causing real scarcity for potential buyers. Monero uses CPU and GPU mining, offering easier access compared to ASIC.

2025-05-20T15:46:01.000Z,"21Shares Predicts Supply Crunch to Push Bitcoin Toward $138K","21Shares reports rising institutional demand and tightening supply could push the Bitcoin price higher amid improving global macro conditions. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching a key breakout phase, bolstered by a convergence of structural factors that extend beyond retail speculation. According to a recent forecast by investment firm 21Shares, Bitcoin could reach $138,500 by the end of 2025. The projection considers rising institutional participation, favorable macroeconomic shifts, and a deepening supply crunch.As of today, Bitcoin trades at $104,684, marking a 2.16% increase over the last 24 hours and a 0.95% rise over the past seven days.Institutional Buying Accelerates as Supply Dwindles21Shares reports that institutional capital has moved to the forefront of Bitcoin’s demand structure. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become consistent net buyers, now absorbing more than the daily 450 BTC generated through mining. https://twitter.com/21Shares/status/1924807485556457684This persistent mismatch between supply and demand is reducing available inventory and supporting higher prices. Simultaneously, institutions are exploring alternative exposure strategies, including allocations via companies such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and the upcoming Twenty One Capital.In parallel, per 21Shares’ report , some public companies are beginning to hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. Additionally, jurisdictions such as New Hampshire and Texas have proposed legislation to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves. Internationally, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund is reportedly accumulating BTC, signaling growing state-level interest in the asset. These developments indicate a foundational shift in how Bitcoin is being adopted and retained by long-term holders.Macroeconomic Trends Reinforce Positive OutlookThe broader macroeconomic environment is also playing a significant role in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are expected to reverse course after two years of rate hikes.Real yields are falling, and the U.S. dollar has weakened in recent months. Concurrently, global liquidity is expanding as central banks in Europe, Japan, and China increase their balance sheets. These changes support risk assets, with Bitcoin notably sensitive to such liquidity movements.Per 21Shares , improved U.S.–China relations have also added momentum. A recent easing of trade tensions between the two countries has lifted investor sentiment. Equity markets have risen, credit spreads have tightened, and monetary indicators such as M2 and the ISM Manufacturing Index have begun to recover. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked M2 growth with a 12-week lag, a pattern that appears to be repeating.Historical Trends Inform Current Projections21Shares notes how Bitcoin’s previous rallies have typically occurred six to twelve months after a halving event. Past cycles, such as those in 2017 and 2020, were often driven by retail enthusiasm and loose monetary policy. While a tenfold gain is not anticipated this time, 21Shares states that a doubling or tripling from Bitcoin’s previous $69,000 peak aligns with historical post-halving behavior.Additionally, retail participation remains moderate compared to past cycles, suggesting that current price growth is primarily institutional in nature. Capital is reportedly flowing from registered investment advisors (RIAs), wirehouses, and corporate investors. This pattern, distinct from prior bull runs, points to a more durable demand base.Other Firms Eyeing $130K And Above In October of last year, research firm Ecoinometrics released an analysis indicating that Bitcoin’s value could potentially double over the following 12 months. This projection was based on the assumption that both Bitcoin and the broader equity markets would sustain upward momentum throughout the period. Under such conditions, the firm suggested that BTC could reach around $130,000 by late 2025, marking a 100% increase from its value at the time of the report.Meanwhile, investment manager VanEck, known for issuing crypto ETFs, outlined a long-term forecast for Bitcoin extending through 2050. The firm presented three distinct scenarios, with its baseline case placing Bitcoin’s value at $2.9 million by 2050. In contrast, VanEck’s conservative—or bear—case forecasted a minimum value of $130,314 by that time.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/20/21shares-predicts-supply-crunch-to-push-bitcoin-toward-138k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=21shares-predicts-supply-crunch-to-push-bitcoin-toward-138k,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Trending Now|Bitcoin Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T15:35:00.000Z,"Cryptocurrencies Are Going Mainstream, On Wall Street And In Washington","Summary Bitcoin and crypto are becoming increasingly integrated into Wall Street and Washington. The global crypto market skyrocketed from a $4 billion to $3.5 trillion market cap over the past decade. Pro-crypto policies are increasingly in favor in Washington, but volatility and consumer protections remain concerns. By James Picerno When bitcoin was launched 16 years ago, few, if any, observers anticipated that the world’s original cryptocurrency would usher in a digital asset revolution that would become deeply woven into the existing financial system. Crypto, after all, was designed to be a revolution against the status quo. But in 2025, digital currencies increasingly look like a part of the establishment rather than the idealistic libertarian crusade initially envisioned. The original motivation for crypto was that it would reinvent, if not subvert, traditional finance, while providing individuals with an off-the-grid alternative to the conventional monetary ecosystem. But as recent events remind, crypto continues to go mainstream and is becoming ever more integrated into Wall Street and Washington. Surprising? Maybe not, when you consider that there’s more money to be made in established world of finance vs. the radical fringe. Yet, the evolution of crypto can be bewildering when you consider that there are still few legal uses for bitcoin (and its growing list of competitors) as a currency beyond speculation. So far, however, that hasn’t slowed the rise of crypto as a widely held asset. A big winner is the underlying plumbing - the blockchain system that enables crypto transactions. This distributed, decentralized computer network for transactions is finding wider adoption across the financial industry, which in turn is helping spawn demand for all things crypto. The overall growth has been nothing less than astonishing. A decade the global market value of crypto currencies was less than $4 billion, according to CoinGecko . The dollar value has since surged to nearly $3.5 trillion - an increase of nearly 87,000%! By comparison, the US stock market (S&P 500 Index ( SPX )) has increased 216% over past ten years. The latest milestone for crypto’s evolution as a mainstream industry: shares of Coinbase ( COIN ), a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, were added to the S&P 500 Index last week. In a sign of the times, Coinbase replaced Discover Financial Services, a conventional bank and credit card firm that’s being acquired by Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF ). Joining the S&P 500 is more than a decision on a whim by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee, which oversees the stock market index. The S&P requires that a company clear several hurdles, including posting a profit in its latest quarterly update and maintaining a market capitalization of at least $10 billion. On the Nasdaq stock exchange, DeFi Technologies ( DEFT ) recently started trading. The company, which a few years ago was considered a long-shot financial disrupter, has evolved into a major player in crypto finance. Another corner of crypto that’s rapidly finding adoption by the mainstream is the so-called stablecoin market, which is shorthand for digital tokens backed by conventional assets, such as Tether, which has a market capitalization of more than $151 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. As products that connect cryptocurrencies with traditional currencies, such as the US dollar, stablecoins seek to maintain a steady value and facilitate conventional financial transactions. Mastercard ( MA ) - one of the major credit card firms - recently said it will allow companies and individuals to make and receive payments in stablecoin accounts. Earlier this year, Stripe ( STRIP ) - a payments platform - bought Bridge, a stablecoin platform. The acquisition is widely seen as a sign that the stablecoin market, after years of growth, is on track for wider use in the financial system. By one estimate, the total value of transactions in stablecoins in 2024 was comparable to Visa’s ( V ), another leading firm in the credit card industry. Meanwhile, Washington has become a center of crypto enthusiasm with the arrival of the Trump administration. In addition to the President’s launch of a meme coin this year, along with his sons’ promotion of various crypto ventures, the US federal regulatory environment for digital assets has become much friendlier in 2025. In contrast with the Biden administration’s aggressive (some would say hostile) approach to overseeing the industry, the White House this year has appointed pro-crypto regulators, such as Paul Atkins, who heads the Securities and Exchange Commission and previously was co-chairman of Token Alliance, an advocacy group for the crypto industry. Wall Street hasn’t been shy about cashing in on crypto. There are now nearly 40 ETFs targeting various niches, including bitcoin and ether as well as trading strategies focused on the assets. The largest crypto ETF is iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). Launched in January 2024, the fund currently has more than $65 billion in assets. Since inception, IBIT’s price has more than doubled, far ahead of the S&P 500’s roughly 25% increase over that span, based on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). With so much going right for the crypto industry, what could go wrong? Several familiar risks continue to lurk, including high market volatility for the likes of bitcoin and the rise of crypto-related cybercrime and scams. A more fundamental challenge for the longer run is developing consumer protections on par with traditional financial assets. Although the regulatory outlook has turned friendly in Washington for crypto, legislation remains a work in progress. The latest step toward wider adoption of crypto arrived on Monday, when the US Senate advanced the GENUIS Act bill, the first major crypto regulatory reform for the stablecoins. Critics charge that the legislation will give Big Tech firms, such as Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Apple ( AAPL ), a relatively free hand to operate their own stablecoins. But while debate rolls on about what constitutes consumer-friendly regulation, there’s a near-consensus that with or without approval of the GENUIS Act, time favors the business opportunities for crypto. Or so it appears, based on investor sentiment for the business outlook. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), which holds a portfolio of companies operating in the crypto economy, is outperforming the US stock market by a wide margin over the past year with a 56% rally vs. 24% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ((SPY)). A key question is how much of crypto’s fortunes rely on the political success and influence of Republicans? To the extent that there’s bipartisan support in Washington for crypto regulation, the odds will look more favorable for expecting that crypto’s mainstream adoption and integration into the wider economy will flourish beyond the next election cycle.

(NYSE American: KULR), announced on Tuesday that it has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 800.3 BTC following an additional $9 million investment. In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said that this brings the company’s total Bitcoin acquisitions to $78 million, with the latest tranche purchased at a weighted average price of $103,234 per BTC. $KULR has acquired 83.3 BTC for ~ 9 million To learn more about our acquistion and our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, check out today's press release. https://t.co/vuQk90DCgh pic.twitter.com/KrW3E4e700 — KULR Technology (@KULRTech) May 20, 2025 This move is part of KULR’s broader Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, first announced on December 4, 2024, which allows for up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash reserves to be allocated to Bitcoin. The company said it sees this as a way to preserve and potentially enhance shareholder value in an inflationary economic environment. KULR Reports BTC Yield of 220.26% Central to this strategy is KULR’s use of “BTC Yield” as a key performance indicator (KPI). Year-to-date, the company reports a BTC Yield of 220.26%, demonstrating the growth in Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s fully diluted share count. This metric provides insight into the effectiveness of KULR’s treasury allocation model. “BTC Yield offers a unique lens through which to evaluate how effectively we’re leveraging digital assets to drive long-term value,” a company spokesperson stated. “It’s a forward-thinking approach to corporate treasury management.” However, KULR also cautions investors against viewing BTC Yield as a direct measure of operational or financial performance. It does not account for liabilities, nor is it designed to predict stock performance. Instead, it serves as a supplemental tool for understanding the growth of digital asset holdings in relation to share dilution. Despite the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies, KULR said it remains committed to disciplined financial management and long-term strategic planning. The company urges investors to consider BTC Yield in conjunction with traditional financial statements and SEC filings. Firms Adding Bitcoin to Their Balance Sheets KULR joins a growing list of companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy. This includes MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. On Monday, Nasdaq-listed Strategy also acquired more Bitcoin.

2025-05-20T15:32:44.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips Below $105,000 As Momentum Continues To Lag","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses during the ongoing session, dropping below the $105,000 level as selling pressure at higher levels kept bullish momentum at bay. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $102,145 on Monday as it started the week in the red before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,573. Despite the decline, BTC remains up by over 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,700. Australia Court Ruling Could Lead To $640M In BTC Tax Refunds A court ruling in Australia could see as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions. The judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. According to reports, the decision came during a hearing for a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole over 80 Bitcoin in 2019. Judge Michael O’Connell ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, linking the asset to Australian Dollars instead of shares, gold, or foreign currency. Judge O’Connell’s interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially putting Bitcoin outside the purview of Australia’s CGT regime. Tax lawyer Adrian Cartland stated that the verdict upends the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position on crypto assets. The ATO has classified Bitcoin and other crypto assets as CGT assets. This meant holders had to pay tax when trading or selling the assets. The ATO stated that selling or exchanging Bitcoin for any other crypto or using it to purchase goods and services was a CGT event. Cartland stated, “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences.” JPMorgan CEO Says Bank Will Allow Clients To Buy Bitcoin JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, has said that the bank will allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin. Dimon announced the move during a speech at the bank’s annual investor day on May 19. “We are going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” The decision to allow customers to purchase Bitcoin is significant, given Dimon’s views on the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader crypto market. Dimon had called Bitcoin worthless in 2021, and reiterated his stance in 2023 during a Senate hearing and again in 2024 at the World Economic Forum. The JPMorgan CEO had stated that he has always been opposed to Bitcoin and crypto, noting that the only true use case of cryptocurrencies for criminals, money laundering, and tax evasion. While the JPMorgan CEO has maintained a negative view of crypto and BTC , the broader banking and financial system has embraced them, with institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley tapping into the crypto ecosystem for their clients. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck under $105,000 as it extended its losses during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week with a drop to $102,045 as selling pressure intensified. However, it recouped some losses, rising to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,573. Analysts believe that despite BTC’s less-than-impressive start to the week, the overall sentiment around the asset was bullish. “The break above key support levels and targeting of the resistance zone near $107,500 suggest a strong potential for a new all-time high, driven by healthier market dynamics rather than speculative excess. Institutional interest remains a key catalyst, as evidenced by JPMorgan’s recent announcement to offer Bitcoin access via spot ETFs, a significant endorsement from a major traditional finance player following Morgan Stanley’s similar moves.” Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered their best day of trading since the beginning of May as smaller funds registered healthy inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw inflows worth $188 million in 24 hours, while ARK 21Shares registered inflows of $155 million. The two funds accounted for half the funds invested across all Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. Bitcoin ETFs registered total inflows of $667 million as BTC maintained its position above $100,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated, “Bitcoin faces strong resistance at $107,000 and must remain above $105,000 to break through this level. Spot ETF inflows continue to boost the asset, with $360 million recorded yesterday. If this move sustains a new high ($110,000) is likely this month where open interest among derivatives is concentrated.” BTC started the previous weekend on a positive note, rising nearly 2% on Saturday and settling at $104,617. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, dropping almost 1% to $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,458 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Source: TradingView Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, registering a marginal decline. BTC continued to drop on Saturday, falling 0.30% and settling at $103,235. The price rebounded on Sunday as bullish sentiment returned, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. BTC lost momentum on Sunday as selling pressure returned, falling to a low of $102,145 before settling at $105,573, ultimately registering a marginal decline.

2025-05-20T15:30:35.000Z,"Ripple CEO Clashes With Senate Crypto Chair Lummis","A simmering dispute between Ripple Labs chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) burst into the open on Monday, May 19, after the senator’s staff cancelled a meeting with the fintech executive and declined to offer a new date. Ripple CEO Starts Public Dispute Garlinghouse, already in Washington to lobby for the pending GENIUS Act on stablecoins and for broader market-structure reform, took the unusual step of airing the dispute on X. “Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation … That said, @SenLummis, as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, cancelled a meeting with me (and won’t reschedule),” he wrote, before challenging the senator to debate him “anytime” in an X Space or on stage at upcoming industry conferences. “As a leader in Congress and Senator from one of the most crypto-friendly states (WY), I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto. I invite you to join me on an X Space anytime (or a live convo onstage at one of the many events we cross paths at) to talk about how to make the US the crypto capital of the world, as is the goal of the Trump Administration. I will continue to do everything possible to support that goal,” Garlinghouse wrote via X. Senator Lummis has not commented publicly on the cancellation, but her office confirmed she is concentrating this week on floor action related to the stable-coin bill, which cleared a 65-32 procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday morning and will now face a lengthy amendment process. The Wyoming Republican—long celebrated by Bitcoin advocates—was tapped in January to chair the Banking Committee’s new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, a post that gives her first crack at shaping federal crypto legislation. At the time of her appointment she declared that “digital assets are the future” and pressed colleagues to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Garlinghouse’s public rebuke exposed a deepening philosophical divide: the Ripple chief argues that US policy must be “multichain,” whereas Lummis has positioned herself as the Senate’s fiercest pro-Bitcoin voice. Bitcoin Maximalists Cheer, Ripple Allies Bristle The senator’s supporters inside the Bitcoin community applauded the snub. Troy Cross of the Bitcoin Policy Institute thanked Lummis: “Just when you thought Lummis couldn’t be a better Bitcoiner. Sen Lummis for keeping the scammers at bay.” Pierre Rochard, vice-president of research at Riot Platforms, derided Garlinghouse on X, claiming he had “ ruined [his] reputation and lost all credibility by pushing for CBDCs and against Bitcoin,” while market commentator Joe Consorti said the Ripple chief’s “lifetime of bashing Bitcoin” had left him with “zero credibility.” XRP partisans fired back.

2025-05-20T15:25:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe Presale Countdown Begins—May Exchange Listings Confirmed","The charts are glowing green again, and crypto confidence is creeping back fast. Bitcoin has surpassed $100K, market sentiment is shifting, and there is a familiar sense of \""don’t miss the next one\"" in the air. Right on cue, Bitcoin Pepe , the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, is about to go live. Bitcoin maxis will finally stop coping because an entire layer 2 platform is being created where DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins can thrive on Bitcoin. With a presale that’s raised over $8m, Bitcoin Pepe is confident and already building. It lists 31st May, which means time’s almost up to scoop up BPEP for just $0.0326. As BTC approaches its previous all-time highs, this might be the ideal opportunity for a subsequent trade. Here’s why! Bitcoin Pepe: Boomer base layer, zoomer energy Bitcoin Pepe is building what no one has pulled off yet: a Solana-style network experience running on top of Bitcoin. This translates to quicker transactions, reduced fees, and a more seamless interface, all while utilizing Bitcoin's robust security features. At the heart of it is PEP-20, a new token standard purpose-built for Bitcoin. It allows anyone to issue tokens natively on BTC’s base layer, cutting out the friction that’s kept Bitcoin behind in meme culture, retail activity, and DeFi. It’s like ERC-20’s explosive early days, but now on the oldest, most trusted chain. The goal is to unlock Bitcoin’s vast capital base, now at over $2 trillion , and finally connect it with the meme ecosystems, NFT platforms, and fast-moving token economies that have so far belonged to Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin Pepe is building infrastructure, and if successful, it could set the standard for how future token projects live and grow on Bitcoin. Solana on Bitcoin + meme mania = 1000x crypto energy incoming Bitcoin dominance just surged above 60% for the first time since early 2021. But most of that capital is idle, locked in cold storage, held by institutions, or priced out of growth opportunities. Bitcoin Pepe offers a new outlet: one that taps into BTC’s reputation for security while layering on the culture, speed, and experimentation that have always driven outsized gains. For the first time, holders will be able to stake, trade, and participate in meme-native activity without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. BPEP arrives as both a protocol and a product that speaks to where the market is headed: performance, participation, and permissionless culture. Solana launched with speed, low fees, and a $0.22 token, and it pulled off one of the biggest runs the market’s seen. But that was a different cycle; Solana was new, and it still had to earn trust. It didn’t have much of a runway, timing, or execution. Bitcoin Pepe is focusing intensively on timing, leverage, architecture, and attention. As capital rushes back in, with Tier 1 listings already in sight, this may not just echo Solana’s rise; it might outrun it. BPEP launches on 31st May as markets open up If you have ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through charts and muttering to yourself, \""I should have invested earlier,\"" then this is your opportunity to reset. This is a market turning green, Bitcoin leading again, and a clear gap where culture meets infrastructure. It’s not copying what worked elsewhere; it’s building what never existed here in the first place. Namely, Bitcoin Pepe is launching straight into the core of crypto’s most trusted, most capital-rich network, Bitcoin, right as momentum returns to the entire market. It unlocks a side of it that’s never been touched. With launch set for the end of May and Tier-1 exchange interest starting to surface, the current price of $0.0326 may be the lowest BPEP will ever see.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Brazil’s Méliuz Commits to Bitcoin Treasury Strategy with $28.4M Acquisition","Brazilian fintech firm Méliuz has announced that it has become the country’s first Bitcoin treasury company, by acquiring $28.4 million in Bitcoin as part of a long-term corporate strategy to integrate the cryptocurrency into its financial operations. Méliuz - Brazil’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm? The strategic move to acquire $28.4 million worth of Bitcoin was confirmed by Méliuz chairman Israel Salmen on X, marking a strategic shift in the firm’s financial operations as it integrates cryptocurrency into its core treasury model. Announcing the acquisition, Salmen described it as a “historic day” for both Méliuz and Brazil’s financial sector. He revealed that shareholders had approved, with a significant majority, the company’s transition into a Bitcoin-focused treasury firm listed in Brazil . Expanding Bitcoin Holdings The recent purchase saw Méliuz acquire 274.52 Bitcoin at an average price of $103,604, bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to 320.2 BTC, with an average acquisition cost of $101,703.80. The latest transaction builds on the company’s initial Bitcoin acquisition of 45.73 BTC in early March. At current market prices, Méliuz’s Bitcoin holdings now exceed $33 million, with data from CoinMarketCap placing Bitcoin at $104,012 at the time of reporting. However, despite Méliuz’s leadership claim in Brazil, regional figures show that e-commerce platform MercadoLibre currently holds a larger Bitcoin treasury in Latin America - 570 Bitcoin valued at approximately $59.2 million, following its most recent purchase of 157.7 BTC in March. Strategic Treasury Model Earlier this month, Méliuz clarified its Bitcoin strategy, stating that it intends to accumulate the asset in an “accretive way” for shareholders through various financial instruments. Rather than treating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency depreciation, the firm has integrated it into its broader business strategy, with the goal of increasing Bitcoin per share for investors. Salmen noted in his announcement, “Our shareholders have approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed in Brazil.” This treasury strategy mirrors the playbook of U.S.-based MicroStrategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Salmen recently met with Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, to celebrate Méliuz’s crypto-focused direction, crediting Saylor for “paving the way” for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Market Response and Industry Standing Méliuz (CASH3.SA) has experienced a surge in stock performance since its initial Bitcoin announcement on March 6. The stock has risen by over 117% since then, based on Google Finance data, propelling the company’s market capitalization to 727.9 million Brazilian real, or roughly $128 million. The fintech firm has also been strengthening its presence in the crypto ecosystem by joining Bitcoin For Corporations as an executive member. The platform announced the development on X, praising Méliuz for “transforming Brazil’s fintech landscape” and integrating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy as part of its long-term vision in a fast-evolving financial world.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Spikes to $107,000, Drops to $102,000 After US AAA Credit Rating Downgrade","After spiking to just over $107,000 early on Monday, Bitcoin bears arrived in force to lop off $5,000 in the period of just a few hours. In traditional finance, Moody’s credit rating agency downgraded US debt to AA1. Is Bitcoin front-running a potential US stock market dip? Bond yields spike and Bitcoin drops as US receives downgrade On Friday, the last of the top three credit rating agencies in the United States downgraded the US credit rating on its debt to Aa1, from Aaa, a rating it had held since 1917. With all three major credit rating agencies having now downgraded the US, the impact on the economy is probably about to be felt. Firstly, treasury yields have already risen as investors perceive the higher risk of holding U.S. Treasury bonds. The baseline 10-year yield has spiked to 4.52%, while the 20 yr and 30 yr yields have surged to over 5%. Volatility is going to be a major factor on Monday, while overall, the downgrade means that the US dollar just will not have the same safe haven attraction for investors as it has up to now. The Bitcoin (BTC) drop to $102,000 may have been a bit of an overreaction, or perhaps the result of profit taking, with the uncertainty of how the US stock market will react probably a major concern. It remains to be seen how the premier cryptocurrency will perform when the markets open later today. A final thought on this is that after the previous two rating agency downgrades, the longer term impact on markets was fairly limited. It might even be asked, if investors lose confidence in the US dollar, into which other fiat currency will they put their money? $BTC drops to 0.786 Fibonacci and gets bought up again Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC chart in the 4-hour time frame, it can be noted that the price crept along the descending trendline for a while before finally breaking free and hitting that $107,000 top early on Monday. However, once it got there the reversal was fairly dramatic and took the price down to perfectly touch the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786, at around $102,000. From there the price has been bought up again. By using the impending downgrade fallout in the US stock market, market manipulators have probably had a good day so far. $BTC bullish weekly candle close Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BTC continues to display a positive story. The weekly candle closed above the critical $104,000 horizontal level - a very bullish event. Of course, the price is back under this level straight away on Monday, but with the rest of the week still to come, another close above $104,000 could be a possibility. The indicators in the Stochastic RSI are coming to the top now, but with the 2-week indicators climbing as well, the weekly indicator lines could stay above the 80.00 level for quite some time. The Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is starting to dip, but once again, there is the whole week left for this to change. All eyes will be on the US stock market when it opens later on Monday. This is likely going to add a lot of volatility to the mix. That said, the market prices these things in ahead of time, and it would not be a surprise for this bad news to be shaken off relatively quickly. The Global Manufacturing PMI data is released on Thursday - could the Moody’s downgrade be a thing of the past by then? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction: The Quiet Signal That Could Ignite the Next Crypto Explosion","Once seen as a joke, Shiba Inu stunned the market with an unexpected surge that turned early holders into millionaires. While much of the hype has cooled, SHIB still commands a strong following and remains one of the most searched meme coins. Its price movements continue to raise questions about whether another breakout may be brewing beneath the surface. What’s different now is how investors look at meme tokens. It’s no longer just about viral moments. They’re watching for deeper signals like community engagement, real-world use cases, and development progress. These signs are quieter than the headlines but may be more reliable. Tokens like Dawgz AI are entering the conversation as attention shifts toward the next crypto to explode. Dawgz AI blends meme coin culture with blockchain and artificial intelligence. While SHIB holds its place in the spotlight, a new wave of projects is quietly gaining traction in unexpected ways. Market Context: Why Shiba Inu Still Matters As of May 18, 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at approximately $0.000014, with a market capitalization of around $8.71 billion. This positions it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap according to CoinMarketCap . Despite price drops since its all-time high in 2021, daily trading volume has stayed consistently strong. It suggests that interest in SHIB hasn't disappeared—it has simply matured. One reason SHIB still holds value is its community. Over 1.3 million wallet addresses currently hold SHIB, according to Etherscan . The project continues to expand its use case with tools like Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution that aims to lower fees and support development on the Shiba Inu ecosystem. These moves help keep the project relevant as newer meme coins enter the market. Investors are also watching SHIB’s burn mechanism. CoinDesk shows billions of tokens have been removed from circulation through manual and automated burns, which are meant to reduce supply and gradually increase scarcity. While not a guaranteed price driver, this kind of deflationary pressure keeps long-term holders interested. SHIB may not be moving fast, but signals like steady volume, project development, and supply control are why many believe it still matters in the broader crypto conversation. Shiba Inu Price Prediction 2025: Patterns & Possibilities Market predictions around Shiba Inu often lean on patterns in past performance. After the 2021 rally, SHIB dropped sharply but then found a zone of stability between $0.000006 and $0.00001. Many traders now consider this range a key support area. If SHIB breaks above $0.000012 with strong volume, some analysts suggest a potential climb back toward the $0.00002 level. This move requires renewed retail interest and a strong push from whales. TradingView charts show that short bursts in volume often coincide with meme-driven market activity. Looking ahead, a realistic Shib Inu price prediction for 2025 depends on three key factors: token burns, Layer 2 adoption, and broader sentiment around meme coins. With Shibarium gaining traction, developers are starting to build projects directly on the SHIB network. If this momentum continues, it could support higher transaction volume and lead to increased utility. That said, prices are also closely tied to Bitcoin cycles. A strong BTC run tends to pull meme coins along for the ride. Investors are cautious but curious. According to CoinGecko , SHIB has remained in the top 10 most searched cryptocurrencies for much of 2024. It signals steady attention, even during quieter market conditions. If Bitcoin regains upward momentum in 2025 and retail traders return, SHIB may ride that wave. But gains are likely to be slower and tied more closely to project milestones rather than just hype. Long-Term Forecast: Shiba Inu Price Prediction 2040 & 2050 Projecting SHIB's price decades ahead requires caution. By 2040 or 2050, supply pressure will remain a major factor. SHIB’s total supply is capped at one quadrillion tokens, but consistent burning has already removed over 410 trillion from circulation. If adoption increases and utility strengthens, analysts from Forbes Digital Assets believe meme tokens could find a lasting role. That would require SHIB to stay relevant and continue building real use cases. On the other hand, if development slows or interest fades, SHIB may struggle to maintain value. Whether it remains a cultural token or becomes a functional one will shape its long-term future. Its price may climb, stay flat, or decline—but its community strength will influence which path it takes. Short-Term Moves: Shiba Inu Price Prediction Tomorrow Short-term traders are watching Shiba Inu closely as price action remains compressed within a narrow band. As of today, SHIB is trading around $0.000014 with daily volume holding steady above $150 million, based on CoinMarketCap data . This kind of sideways movement often creates tension in the market, especially when volume stays high. It can signal that buyers and sellers are waiting for a trigger that sends the price in a clear direction. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are showing neutral readings. It means the market is not currently overbought or oversold. According to TradingView analysis , any move above the 50-day moving average could attract short-term interest. However, without a catalyst, such as a burn event or exchange listing, the token may remain range-bound. Price prediction for tomorrow depends more on market sentiment than fundamentals. Social media mentions and search trends can create sudden surges. It is important to note that short-term gains come with higher risk due to the speed at which meme tokens can reverse direction. What Is the Next Crypto to Explode? Signs Beyond SHIB The search for the next crypto to explode leads investors to projects that show strong community support and have room to grow. Tokens that succeed in breakout cycles combine market appeal with early utility. According to Forbes Digital Assets , coins with a clear use case, active development, and investor interest are more likely to gain traction. Meme coins that adapt and offer something different tend to stand out during quiet market periods. Shiba Inu sparked interest because of its viral rise, but newer tokens are building around deeper trends. Projects tied to artificial intelligence, smart contracts, or social interaction are gaining momentum. Many investors now use tools like Coinbase and Binance to track low-cap assets that show early signs of growth. These platforms also report trending searches and trading activity that can indicate where attention is shifting next. Some crypto enthusiasts are now looking at Dawgz AI as a potential breakout token. It combines meme coin energy with artificial intelligence and aims to offer more than just market hype. Although still in its early phase, Dawgz AI is part of a trend where communities are drawn to tokens that carry a purpose. While SHIB holds its place in meme coin history, attention is starting to spread toward projects that are trying new things on the same foundation. Dawgz AI: The Meme Coin with a Machine Mind As interest shifts toward tokens with more than just viral potential, a few newer projects are starting to gain traction among crypto enthusiasts. One of the names appearing across community forums and presale trackers is Dawgz AI, a meme token built on Ethereum that connects artificial intelligence with decentralized ownership. What makes it stand out is not just the theme but the structure behind it. Dawgz AI is not tied to NFTs and is instead focused on building a utility-backed token powered by AI functions that serve its holders. The project recently passed a public audit with SolidProof , which adds transparency for new investors. The token is currently priced at $0.004 and has already raised over $3.6 million in its presale. These early signals are helping Dawgz AI build momentum without depending on inflated marketing claims. Investors are watching how the project develops, especially since it enters the market with clear messaging and a technical foundation. The meme coin space has often been unpredictable, but tokens with verifiable structure tend to hold interest longer. Dawgz AI reflects a shift in how meme coins are built and marketed. Instead of just chasing hype, it introduces AI-backed goals that resonate with users looking for practical value. This hybrid approach may appeal to a new wave of buyers who want fun combined with function. While the token is still in its presale phase, its early progress and growing visibility suggest it is worth tracking as part of the “next crypto to explode” conversation. For further insights, please check out this video: Risk Factors: What Investors Should Know Every crypto project carries risk, and meme coins are no exception. Whether it’s Shiba Inu or a newer token like Dawgz AI, understanding the risks can help investors make better decisions. Below are key concerns to keep in mind: Volatility remains highMeme coins often see sharp price swings within hours. SHIB has dropped more than 80% from its all-time high according to CoinGecko , and similar behavior is expected from low-cap tokens. Dawgz AI is still in its presale phase, which means price discovery will likely be unpredictable once it hits the open market. Lack of long-term utility can stall momentumWhile Dawgz AI is building AI-based use cases, most meme coins struggle to maintain relevance over time. If utility does not grow alongside the token supply, the price may remain flat even during bull cycles. Shiba Inu has avoided this to some degree by expanding its ecosystem, but that does not guarantee future growth. Regulatory uncertainty adds pressureCountries are tightening rules on meme coins and low-utility assets. A recent report from CNBC outlined how regulators are reviewing crypto categories more closely. Dawgz AI passed an audit from SolidProof, which may help increase trust, but it still operates in a space that lacks global clarity. Bottom Line: Dawgz AI and the Quiet Signals Behind the Next Surge Shiba Inu remains one of the most watched meme coins for a reason. It has history, a loyal base, and ongoing efforts to expand its ecosystem. But today’s market is shifting. Traders are not just chasing hype. They are following subtle patterns that suggest where new attention might go next. Dawgz AI is not trying to replace SHIB. It is part of a broader move toward tokens that offer more than a meme. Its audit, AI integration, and presale traction make it one of the early-stage projects worth watching. These are the kinds of quiet signals that have historically come before explosive moves in crypto. If you’re tracking the next wave of meme coins with substance, now is the time to watch Dawgz AI. Visit the Dawgz AI , follow its progress, and stay alert as it develops in real time. The next breakout doesn’t always come from the loudest token. Sometimes, it starts with a quiet idea backed by action. FAQs Section What is the Shiba Inu price prediction for 2025? Shiba Inu could stay range-bound unless Shibarium adoption and token burns gain momentum. While long-term holders remain active, newer tokens like Dawgz AI are drawing attention from investors looking for different growth signals. Is Dawgz AI a serious project or just hype? Dawgz AI has completed an audit through SolidProof and has raised over $3.6 million in its presale. It is still early, but some investors see its AI-based focus as a step toward more structured meme coins. What is the next crypto to explode in 2025? There is no guaranteed pick, but traders are watching projects with community support and technical backing. Dawgz AI is often mentioned in that discussion because of its utility angle and early traction. Why are meme coins still popular? Meme coins remain appealing because they create fast-moving communities and often reflect internet culture. Newer tokens like Dawgz AI add features that keep investors engaged beyond the initial hype. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction – Can the Project Deliver on Its Promise?","Cryptocurrency has come a long way from the early days of mining Bitcoin on a laptop. In 2025, mobile-first platforms like Pi Network ask a bold question: what if the next big thing is already in your pocket? Pi Network, designed to be mined from your phone without draining battery life, has captured a loyal global following of over 47 million users. It promises ease of use, wide accessibility, and a vision of decentralisation that doesn’t demand technical knowledge. Investors looking for the next breakout coin are watching closely, but many also wonder whether the infrastructure and economics behind Pi Network are strong enough to support lasting success. And in a crowded market, newer projects like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) show what it means to back a meme coin with actual functionality, especially when AI enters the equation. About Pi Network Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, Pi Network was built around a simple idea: make crypto accessible to everyone through a mobile app. Instead of energy-consuming traditional mining, users “mine” Pi by pressing a button once every 24 hours. While this sounds overly simplified, the process is part of a social consensus mechanism that rewards engagement. The app grew rapidly by encouraging users to invite friends, creating a web of referrals that brought in millions of new miners. Now that Pi Network has transitioned to mainnet status, the developers have promised to unlock a full economy where users can spend and transfer Pi just like other digital currencies. However, the timeline has remained vague, leaving many wondering if this is still a proof-of-concept or if something bigger is waiting in the wings. Pi Network Price Prediction – What's Next? Unsurprisingly, any Pi Network price prediction will be highly speculative given the token's short price history. Currently worth $0.6731, here are the various expert forecasts for this project in the next few years. Short-Term Forecast (2025): Minimum price: $0.7909 Maximum price: $1.2691 Mid-Term Forecast (2026): Minimum for 2026: $1.16 Maximum for 2026: $4.5 The future of Pi will depend on whether its team can build an economy around the token beyond just peer-to-peer mining and community referrals. Dawgz AI: A New Contender With a Different Approach While Pi Network is still proving itself, Dawgz AI is quietly rewriting the rulebook on what a meme token can do in 2025. In a year of short attention spans and endless competition, it brings something different to the table: actual tech beneath the meme. It’s early, but this project has the kind of blueprint that makes people look twice, especially in a year where “new” needs to mean something more than just another dog logo. Here's How to Join the Dawgz Army!🐾This step-by-step guide has everything you need to know in order to purchase $DAGZ and start earning staking rewards right away. 🚀 https://t.co/IcMbSZjVtM — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) January 16, 2025 What Makes Dawgz AI Stand Out? Unlike projects relying on community momentum, Dawgz AI combines AI-driven trading tools with tokenised incentives. Here’s what’s under the hood and why it’s not just a meme for meme’s sake: AI-Powered Trading Bots: These aren’t just buzzword tools. Dawgz AI stakers can access bots designed to automate crypto strategies. That means users can actually use the project, not just hold and hope. $3.59 Million Raised (and Climbing): Before even launching on exchanges, the project has raised serious capital. That shows significant investor confidence, which isn't always common in meme coins. 8.88 Billion Token Supply: With a capped and transparent supply, Dawgz AI avoids the problem of endless inflation that has tanked other tokens. Designed Tokenomics: 30% of tokens go to presale, 20% for staking rewards, and 15% to fuel community involvement. It's designed to last, not just spike. Audit by SolidProof: Security matters, especially in meme coin land. Dawgz AI went through an audit from SolidProof , a well-known firm in the crypto world. Dawgz AI vs Pi Network – Two Paths to the Future While Pi Network aims for long-term adoption by being mobile and inclusive, Dawgz AI is building out immediate tools that crypto traders can use today. It’s also worth noting that while Pi has relied on closed systems and delays, Dawgz AI is open about tokenomics, audit status, and launch roadmap. That transparency may help it avoid the uncertain limbo that Pi faced. Who Should Consider Dawgz AI? Dawgz AI offers the ability to stake, trade, and use AI-powered features for investors looking for something beyond passive speculation. It’s also appealing to meme coin fans who want functionality rather than just viral marketing. The presale is still ongoing, which means early access is still possible. For those who missed the early DOGE or SHIB waves, Dawgz AI could be one of the more interesting entries in 2025. Final Thoughts Pi Network has a global user base and a concept that resonates: mining crypto with no technical skill required. Pi’s success will depend on delivering a functioning mainnet, real token utility, and consistent updates. Meanwhile, projects like Dawgz AI show that meme tokens don’t have to rely on luck or virality. They can offer tools, structure, and purpose, even in the midst of dog-themed chaos. If Pi delivers, it could create a new category of mobile-first crypto ecosystems. But if procrastination persists, newer contenders like Dawgz AI might take the spotlight! FAQs Section Will pi coin have a future? Yes, Pi has massive potential. Still, the future depends on whether the team can turn community hype into real-world token utility. Which crypto will boom in 2025? The next breakout coin in 2025 will likely combine innovation with usability. Projects that offer real utility alongside strong branding are gaining serious traction this year. Can you make $1000 a month with crypto? It's possible, but success usually comes from more than just holding tokens. It often involves staking, smart strategies, or using platforms that integrate AI or automation to support consistent returns.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now: BPEP, Pepe, and Other Meme Breakouts","Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , Pepe, and a handful of breakout meme coins are again turning heads in the crypto market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, these fast-moving, community-driven tokens are capturing market attention. Bitcoin Pepe stands out as the first meme coin layer 2 built on Bitcoin, combining the viral power of memes with Bitcoin’s trusted security. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 token standard introduces a new era for BTC, enabling meme coin creation and rapid on-chain activity. Meanwhile, classics like Pepe show strong price action, riding fresh waves of retail interest. Investors are now eyeing Bitcoin Pepe after the meme coin raised over $9.3m in ICO funding, and rumors of a CEX listing broke. With Bitcoin Pepe’s May 31st listing event approaching, these meme assets might offer some of the highest upside potential in today’s market. PEPE’s meteoric rise signals a new meme market leader PEPE has exploded with a 70% gain in just seven days, shifting attention from traditional dog-themed meme coins to this frog-inspired contender. The surge has been backed by serious money moves. LookOnChain reports that one whale’s 10x long on PEPE is now sitting on huge unrealized profits. With 19 green candles out of the last 30, traders are no longer laughing. Source If PEPE breaks through the key resistance at $0.0000155, analysts believe a 38% move to $0.0000214 is possible. Q2 2025 could mark a defining moment as PEPE eyes top meme status with bullish momentum behind it. Bitcoin Pepe presale ignites as BTC surge sparks meme coin gold rush Early-stage presales are capturing the attention as the crypto market prepares for what many anticipate to be its most explosive bull run yet. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is a disruptive new project fusing meme coin energy with Bitcoin’s market power. One of Bitcoin Pepe's most groundbreaking features is introducing the PEP-20 token standard. This innovation allows users to create and trade tokens directly on Bitcoin Pepe’s new Layer 2 without the complexities tied to traditional Bitcoin infrastructure or the need to bridge over to altcoin networks. With PEP-20, launching a meme coin on Bitcoin becomes as fast and straightforward as deploying an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. By removing friction, PEP-20 sets the stage for an explosion of new tokens and viral projects anchored to Bitcoin’s unmatched trust and security. Bitcoin Pepe could become the heart of a thriving meme economy on the world's most valuable blockchain if adoption scales. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Link Built as a high-speed, low-fee Layer 2 on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe unlocks a $2 trillion liquidity pool and allows meme coins to thrive on the most secure blockchain in crypto. Priced at $0.0342, BPEP will list on May 31. With comparisons to “Solana on Bitcoin,” the hype of Bitcoin as the best crypto to buy now is real, and the time to buy in is running out. Dogecoin gains momentum as whale activity and bullish patterns emerge Dogecoin is joining the meme coin rally, climbing 35% since May 7, 2025. Yet, the top meme token has struggled to break the $0.25 resistance decisively. A daily close above $0.255 could unlock the next leg up, potentially igniting bullish momentum. Source Whale activity is intensifying, with over 60.9 billion DOGE traded in a single day—a 41.12% surge in large transactions. This signals major market interest. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows 75.08% of Binance traders are long on DOGE. A confirmed head-and-shoulders breakout adds technical fuel, so the DOGE is placed on the breakout watch. The U.S. SEC has officially acknowledged Nasdaq’s application to list the 21Shares US Dogecoin ETF , marking a pivotal step in the regulatory process. 21Shares confirmed the update via X, highlighting its push to bring meme coins into regulated finance. If the SEC gives the green light, institutional investors could soon gain direct exposure to Dogecoin through a compliant, tradable fund, potentially driving a new wave of adoption. As the crypto bull market gains strength behind Bitcoin’s surge, leading meme coins like PEPE and DOGE are reclaiming key price levels. Yet, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is drawing major attention from forward-looking investors looking for the best crypto to buy now. With its exchange debut confirmed for May 31, early backers are eyeing massive upside. However, the window to buy in and participate in this opportunity closes shortly.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Genius Stablecoin Bill Predicted to Pass Soon","For the first time in years, the path toward clear crypto regulation in the United States no longer looks hypothetical—it’s materializing. Momentum is building around stablecoin legislation, with bipartisan efforts inching closer to a breakthrough. The GENIUS Act, designed to regulate stablecoin issuers, is gaining traction in the Senate, bringing long-awaited clarity to a critical segment of the crypto sector. As regulatory certainty begins to replace ambiguity, the stage is being set for tokens with strong utility and stablecoin integrations to benefit. With the right projects, investors could be positioning themselves ahead of a structural shift in U.S. crypto policy. Stablecoin Bill Nears Senate Vote Momentum is returning to stablecoin regulation in Washington. The GENIUS Act—short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins”—may finally reach the Senate floor for a decisive vote next week. Backed by Senators Bill Hagerty and Kirsten Gillibrand, the bill aims to create the first federal framework for stablecoin issuers, giving much-needed structure to a sector vital to crypto trading. Though the bill previously passed through the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support, it recently stumbled during a cloture vote, mainly due to concerns from Democrats over consumer protections and potential corporate misuse. New changes to the bill now include safeguards against tech giants like Meta issuing stablecoins, while still allowing participation from private companies sparking fresh debate. The Senate needs 60 votes in Monday’s session to push the bill into formal debate . If cleared, the act could proceed toward final passage, marking a historic milestone in U.S. crypto policy. Gillibrand insists the updated draft offers “robust consumer protections” while enabling innovation—a balance that could help win over undecided lawmakers. The House is working on a separate version, and any final law will require reconciliation between the two chambers. While political friction remains—particularly surrounding Trump-linked crypto ventures—this bill has the rare potential to unify both sides around stablecoin oversight. If passed, it would pave the way for compliant stablecoin projects to gain legitimacy, possibly boosting adoption and investor confidence across the board. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Benefit From Such Developments Solaxy Solaxy operates in a category most projects avoid—foundational infrastructure. It supports transactions on both Ethereum and Solana, not as a wrapper, but as a dedicated Layer 2 optimized for throughput, cost-efficiency, and chain-agnostic transfers. That alone gives it a technical relevance many tokens simply don’t have. If the GENIUS Act passes, creating firm standards for stablecoins, it’s not just issuers that benefit—it’s the networks that carry them. Solaxy was built for scale, and its ability to handle cross-chain movement efficiently could make it a preferred channel for regulated stablecoins once compliance becomes the norm. Solaxy has been covered by top crypto YouTubers and veterans like Austin Hilton, who also seem to be quite bullish on the project’s growth. Its native token, SOLX, powers a staking protocol that offers high APY, but the real draw is its role in transaction routing and future protocol upgrades tied to real settlement demand. As regulators set clearer rules, attention often shifts from speculative tokens to the architecture underneath. Solaxy is positioned as the latter. It doesn’t rely on hype or heavy branding. It leans into performance and speed—qualities that become more valuable once stablecoins move from loosely regulated assets to financial-grade products. The bill, if passed, could shift capital flows toward networks that can host regulated liquidity without friction. Solaxy checks that box. SUBBD SUBBD isn’t a payments protocol or a utility layer, it’s a reaction to platform control. In a creator economy that’s still heavily reliant on Web2 intermediaries, SUBBD introduces a system where creators, fans, and curators interact using smart contracts rather than centralized dashboards. Its native token, $SUBBD, functions as access, currency, and voting power. Content monetization is handled through blockchain-based licensing, tipping, and premium unlocks. With the GENIUS Act potentially defining how payment tokens operate in the U.S., systems like SUBBD that can sidestep traditional processor fees by using stablecoins might benefit directly. It’s not far-fetched to imagine a future where stablecoins become the default method of transacting between creators and fans—regulated, accepted, and recognized. If that happens, platforms already designed to accommodate such flows natively will likely get ahead. SUBBD is structured for exactly that. More than just another Web3 publishing tool, it gives creators complete ownership of distribution. From live interactions to gated content and community polls, it folds social functionality into programmable income. The bill may not be targeting creator tools specifically, but by legitimizing stablecoin-based payments, it indirectly opens a path for platforms like SUBBD to scale without friction. BTC Bull BTC Bull isn’t a stablecoin project, but its structure reflects the logic behind the GENIUS Act, which is to reduce volatility where it matters and build community strength around a core currency. BTC Bull simply provides utility by rewarding users who actively support Bitcoin through staking, voting, and holding, through airdrops and burns as Bitcoin crosses certain price milestone. It uses its native token to drive engagement in Bitcoin-focused campaigns, including content, education, and growth initiatives. If stablecoins gain a formal regulatory green light, and crypto payments inch closer to mainstream, projects that emphasize alignment with Bitcoin’s long-term value may find more legitimacy. BTC Bull capitalizes on this by functioning less like a speculative play and more like a loyalty layer tied to Bitcoin’s ethos. Its staking system encourages long-term thinking, and the voting mechanism rewards participation in ecosystem decisions. It’s meme-anchored, but structurally thoughtful. As the GENIUS Act moves closer to passage, crypto’s image in the U.S. may shift from chaotic to credible. BTC Bull has baked its identity around that transition—packaging community-driven support for Bitcoin in a model that’s both engaging and scalable. It doesn’t need to change direction if the rules shift. It’s already moving in sync with them. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe doesn’t behave like most meme coins—and that’s exactly the point. While others thrive on short-term virality, this project builds around a persistent AI agent that interacts with markets, monitors sentiment, and adapts in real time. It’s a self-operating persona, not just a brand. At the center is the $MIND token, which governs access to this AI’s insights and interaction loops. Instead of relying on external trendsetters, MIND of Pepe generates its own. The AI posts across social platforms, adjusts its tone based on engagement metrics, and evolves with market movements. Investors aren’t following hype—they’re watching a digital character that creates it. So how does a stablecoin bill tie into this? If the GENIUS Act reshapes how stablecoins are used, tracked, and trusted, platforms that thrive on behavioral data—especially ones plugged into social sentiment—gain sharper visibility. MIND of Pepe is built to digest these shifts, instantly factoring new regulation into its output and recommendations. This isn't a passive token—it’s part of a growing experiment in autonomous influence. And as stablecoins become more embedded in regulated finance, investor psychology will shift. People will no longer just follow noise—they’ll seek signals. MIND of Pepe was designed for that environment. It’s part memecoin, part AI lab. If the regulatory fog starts to lift, expect more investors to look toward assets that understand the crowd before the crowd realizes it’s being understood. MIND of Pepe has been built with that premise from day one. Conclusion The noise around regulation has finally started narrowing into something concrete. When rules start taking shape, the tokens best aligned with that shift often aren’t the ones chasing attention—they’re the ones already built with that future in mind. As the bill moves forward, the entries listed earlier don’t just benefit from the moment—they reflect where the market could be headed next.

HINU had recently registered a price jump to its current level of $0.00017376. The project has raised $759,312 so far as its successful pre-launch phase continues. Husky Inu (HINU) Gears Up For Next Price Jump The Husky Inu (HINU) community is gearing up for its latest price jump, with the token set to rise to $0.00017427. The price jump is part of its pre-launch phase, which kicked off on April 1. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the project’s fledgling yet growing community and ensure they can benefit from favorable pricing. If you remember, the token price at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000 and has steadily increased since. The token price has risen every two days, with the increase continuing until the tokens sell out. The project has raised $759,312 and is getting closer to the $1.2M milestone. Understanding The Pre-Launch Phase Let’s understand how the pre-launch phase will work. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. This price will increase every two days until all the HINU tokens sell out. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. The table below highlights the projected price if the presale continues uninterrupted. The HINU token has witnessed several price increases since the beginning of the phase and is currently priced at $0.00017275, with the next price jump imminent. Crypto Markets Decline Meanwhile, the crypto market has registered a notable decline as most cryptocurrencies started the week in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session, losing momentum after rising over 3% on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $102,145 during the ongoing session before moving to its current level of $104,988. Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, dropping nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, slipping below $2,500, trading around $2,467.

The flagship cryptocurrency held above $103,000 for most of the weekend before moving late on Sunday/early Monday, rising to an intraday high of $106,847 before registering a steep decline and falling below $104,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading at $103,296. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) extended its losses over the weekend and has dropped nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, slipping below $2,400 to $2,394. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is down 1.28%, trading around $165. Dogecoin (DOGE) has bucked the bearish trend, up nearly 2%. However, Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) traded firmly in bearish territory. Australian Authorities Seize Bitcoin, Mansion Linked To Exchange Hack Authorities in Australia have seized Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion, and a Mercedes Benz car allegedly linked to a crypto exchange hack. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) issued a statement on May 18 saying it had seized nearly 25 BTC along with the mansion and the car. The total worth of the seizure was 4.5 million Australian Dollars ($2.88 million). The AFP began its investigation into the assets in September after law enforcement agencies in Luxembourg shared details about suspicious Bitcoin transactions. Luxembourg authorities said the transactions were linked to a Queensland individual previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company. The AFP stated their investigation also tied the individual to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. However, no criminal charges were brought over the theft of Bitcoin. According to local agencies, the owner of the assets is Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty to fraud and computer hacking in 2016 and selling data of League of Legends players. However, prosecutors did not convict Duffy of the attack, stating he received a copy of the data online and sold it for profit. Duffy was also accused of hacking the X account of Riot Games President Marc Merrill to publicize his data-selling business. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy stated, “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community.” Crypto Firms In The UK Must Report Customer Transactions Crypto companies operating in the UK must collect and report data from every trade and transfer beginning January 2026 as part of an effort to improve tax reporting. According to a UK Revenue and Customs Department statement, crypto firms must collect the user’s full name, home address, and tax identification number for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved. The statement added that failure to comply with the directive will incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds per user. The department stated it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming guidelines. The new rules are part of the UK’s integration of the Organization for Economic Development’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework, designed to improve transparency and efficiency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the government’s aim to establish a robust regulatory environment supporting growth while ensuring consumer protection. The UK’s move to integrate crypto rules into its existing financial framework is in stark contrast with the EU’s approach. The EU introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. VCs View Stablecoins Positively The latest Pitchbook report on crypto VC trends has revealed their overwhelmingly positive views on stablecoins. The report stated, “Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially—from broader risk-off moves. Our expectations remain that VC investments in the near term could see a step-up increase, especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.” However, the report stated that VCs will commit more to the crypto industry only if it works to address growing security concerns. These concerns were amplified by the recent Bybit hack. The report also predicted that institutional investors would begin demanding real-time proof of real-time proof-of-reserve tooling and middleware that “abstracts” away key-management complexity. The report also highlighted a decline in retail speculation, leading to a substantial loss in meme coin volumes, especially on Solana. The drop in retail interest has led to a significant drop in investment in prominent meme coins. The report added that Circle’s upcoming IPO could create significant crypto liquidity and potentially validate the stablecoin model. “Taken together, Q1 2025 was a quarter of consolidation rather than capitulation. Market beta turned negative, but venture-relevant signals—stablecoin growth, infrastructure de-risking, and a credible IPO pipeline—remain intact.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend calm was broken on Sunday when the flagship cryptocurrency unexpectedly jumped over 3%, catching the markets off guard. However, what followed next was even stranger, as the price dropped back, falling to a low of $102,145 before moving to its current levels above $103,000. The sudden increase saw over $460 million in long positions wiped out. The price jump took BTC just shy of its all-time high before it fell back to current levels. Economists have stated that BTC’s current price levels are due to growing institutional interest and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the current price levels are sustained by strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which registered $2.8 billion in net inflows in May, taking the total value past $122 billion. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated in a note to investors, “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on May 19 draws closer. History tells us that index inclusion tends to act as a short-term catalyst, as passive managers adjust their allocations to track the benchmark more closely.” A positive economic outlook has also helped BTC maintain its current price levels. The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%, maintaining a cautious stance. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the Fed is prepared to respond to evolving data but has offered no imminent shift in policy due to inflation concerns. BTC’s price action has been subdued after its May 8 rally, when it surged past $100,000 and settled at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal decline, slipping below $103,000 and settling at $102,851. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 1.72% and settling at $103,617.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued its downward trajectory, starting the new week in the red after experiencing volatility on Sunday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency lost momentum after failing to move past the 200-day SMA on Tuesday (May 13) and has continued to trade downwards as buyers struggled to reclaim momentum. ETH must reclaim and close above $2,450 to prevent a decline to $2,000.

However, the price plummeted during the ongoing session and dropped over 7% to its current level of $161. A drop below $160 could see SOL plunge below $150.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction – Will It Become the Best Altcoin to Buy This Year?","As cryptocurrency continues to move from niche interest to mainstream discussion, new projects pop up regularly, each promising a unique advantage. One that’s drawn attention is Pi Network, a mobile-first mining platform accessible to anyone with a smartphone. But with an uncertain trading future and a launch on a few major exchanges, investors are beginning to question whether Pi Network will become the best altcoin to buy this year. In this article, we’ll look at what Pi Network is doing right and where it still needs to improve. We'll also compare it to some of the more grounded, active projects in the space, including a few lesser-known altcoins that are already available, trading, or in presale with clearer roadmaps. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out for its combination of innovation, accessibility, and use of AI to simplify crypto investing. Understanding Pi Network (And A 2025 Price Prediction) Pi Network launched to make cryptocurrency mining easy for everyone. Users download the mobile app and earn Pi tokens by simply logging in and confirming they're not a bot. The pitch? No battery drain, no special equipment, and no complicated onboarding process. This simplicity helped it quickly attract millions of users. Pi Network recently reached 'open mainnet' status and was listed on a few exchanges. However, many holders who had been mining for years before this point still need to wait before they can actually cash out, which has sparked more questions about the true value of Pi. While Pi Network focuses on easy access and getting people involved, its recency and the absence of market value make it difficult to analyze its future. The same goes for an accurate Pi network price prediction in 2025. Currently valued at $0.8832, analysts forecast the token could reach $2-3 this year: the worst-case scenario is a minimum of $0.60. Top 3 Altcoins to Watch Right Now Instead of waiting for Pi to surge, some investors are looking toward other altcoins already delivering results or building practical ecosystems. Three projects could attract attention this year, starting with Dawgz AI. 1. Dawgz AI - The AI Trading Meme Coin Dawgz AI blends meme coin style with technology that serves a purpose. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers automated AI-driven trading tools for users who want hands-free investing. These bots use algorithmic strategies to react to market shifts, helping holders stay active in the market without doing everything manually. One interesting part of Dawgz AI is how it gamifies bot usage. When you stake your tokens, you unlock bot access at different levels. The higher the tier, the more advanced the bot features become. This gives users a reason to hold rather than flip the token. Security-wise, Dawgz AI has completed an audit by SolidProof , adding a level of trust and transparency. The presale price currently sits at $0.004 and will rise to $0.00438 soon. With over $3.5 million already raised, interest in the project is growing. The total supply is 8.88 billion tokens, with 20% going toward staking rewards, which adds a passive earning component. Whether you’re drawn in by the meme-themed branding or the functional tools, Dawgz AI offers something different! 2. VeChain (VET) - Blockchain for Tracking Supply Chains VeChain continues to garner attention due to its practical use cases in supply chain logistics. The project allows companies to track products from creation to delivery using blockchain for transparency. This use has already been adopted in industries like fashion, automotive, and food safety. Unlike more speculative coins, VeChain has been live for years and is actively used by enterprise clients. Its dual-token system (VET for value transfer and VTHO for operations) helps control costs while maintaining scalability. While price movement hasn't been explosive recently, the coin remains relatively low-cost and has the kind of enterprise partnerships many new projects would envy. For investors looking for a token tied to real-world application, VeChain offers a distinctive angle. 3. Stacks (STX) - Bringing Smart Contracts and DeFi to Bitcoin. Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain that enables smart contracts and DeFi tools on Bitcoin. It brings functionality like NFTs and dApps to Bitcoin’s secure base layer, aiming to turn BTC into more than just a store of value. This year, attention around Bitcoin-native applications has grown, especially with rising interest in Ordinals and Bitcoin-based NFTs. Stacks benefits directly from this trend and has seen volume and network activity spikes. For people who believe in Bitcoin's long-term strength but want exposure to more flexible tech, STX offers a middle ground. It remains under $1, keeping it affordable while delivering unique access to BTC development. Final Thoughts: Is Pi Network Worth the Wait? Pi Network has certainly built a large following, with the hope of greater prominence in the coming months. Still, many traders would consider the project uncharted territory given the long time it took to become official. In contrast, projects like Dawgz AI and others listed above allow you to act today. Whether you want an AI-enhanced trading experience, a token linked to enterprise use, or something tied to DeFi technology, there are multiple paths to explore. With so many altcoins under $1 offering actual features and trading options, waiting around for Pi may leave you on the sidelines. Choosing an active project could help you stay ahead of the next market wave, and Dawgz AI might be one of the most interesting ways to do it. FAQs Section Will pi ever be worth money? It could be, but only if it lives up to its promises and gets listed on more exchanges. Meanwhile, other projects already in presale or trading may be more worthwhile. Which crypto will boom in 2025? AI-powered and meme-based projects like Dawgz AI are arguably gaining the most attention this year. Which crypto will hit $1? Lower-cost tokens with working ecosystems and active development, especially in presale phases, might be better positioned to approach the $1 mark as adoption grows.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Best Crypto To Buy For Quick Gains as BNB, ETH, and SOL Pegged to Bitcoin’s $100K+ Push","Bitcoin Pepe is capturing major attention as the best crypto to buy now, while the crypto market gears up for Bitcoin’s long-anticipated break above $100,000. While heavyweights like BNB, ETH, and SOL are expected to ride the wave of Bitcoin’s momentum, Bitcoin Pepe offers something even more explosive—early-stage growth potential paired with real infrastructure. As Bitcoin's first meme-focused layer 2, it blends BTC’s unmatched security with the viral energy of meme culture. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 token standard unlocks token creation directly on Bitcoin, a game-changer for meme coin adoption. With presale funding surging past $9m, rumors of CEX listing spreading, and listing set for May 31, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now for rapid gains. Why BNB is still a strong bet for 2025 Binance Coin (BNB) might not deliver the explosive returns seen in other tokens, but analysts are not counting it out. Standard Chartered has projected a potential rise to $1,275 by 2025, driven by upcoming ETF developments and the growing integration of artificial intelligence within the Binance ecosystem. Source Currently hovering around $650, BNB’s slower momentum than its peers is mainly due to its more centralized framework and measured growth pace. Still, with deep-rooted infrastructure, AI-powered upgrades, and mounting institutional interest, BNB’s breakout could be a matter of patience, not possibility. For long-term investors, the runway is still intact. Ethereum’s trillion-dollar security initiative reinforces bullish momentum Ethereum is doubling down on security at a pivotal moment. On May 14, the Ethereum Foundation on X announced the launch of its ambitious Trillion Dollar Security Initiative to protect critical areas such as wallets, smart contracts, infrastructure, and user interfaces. 0. Announcing the Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative: an ecosystem-wide effort to upgrade Ethereum’s security to help bring the world onchain. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) May 14, 2025 This move comes just days after the Pectra upgrade helped propel ETH’s price by over 43%, briefly touching $2,750. Source Analysts now view the $2,000–$2,300 range as crucial support. If this level holds, Ethereum could be on track to break past $3,000, strengthening its grip as the top programmable blockchain while boosting confidence among long-term investors. Bitcoin Pepe tipped as top altcoin as May 31 listing nears Bitcoin Pepe is quickly positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Built as the first meme-centric layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin, it brings together the reliability of Bitcoin’s security with Solana-style speed and scalability. This blend offers investors a powerful mix of trust and meme-driven momentum. Bitcoin Pepe is rewriting what’s possible on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its presale rewards early investors and anchors its bold vision, unlocking Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap for the meme coin era. Using the groundbreaking PEP-20 token standard, Bitcoin Pepe introduces Solana-like speed via a Bitcoin layer 2 custom-built for meme assets. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one...

Once the token lists on exchanges, the presale gains could accelerate. With staking pools offering up to 10,000% APY and major features like a meme-focused DEX and NFT marketplace, Bitcoin Pepe ’s momentum as the best crypto to buy now heading into its May 31 listing is unmistakable. Solana eyes $200 breakout as traders weigh cup-and-handle setup Solana (SOL) is again a focal point in the crypto market, hovering around $175 after brushing against key resistance near $170. The $170–$185 range has become a critical zone, with traders debating whether the current price action signals bullish consolidation or looming exhaustion. Crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has flagged a developing cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a confirmed breakout above $200 could trigger a fresh wave of buying. While overbought signals remain a concern, the broader altcoin rally led by Bitcoin and Ethereum supports bullish sentiment. The next few sessions may prove decisive for Solana’s short-term trajectory. #Solana $SOL above $200 is an instant buy, as it could be breaking out of this massive cup-and-handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/cE2XUSTGLJ — Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2025 Unlike the other three established altcoins, Bitcoin Pepe offers traders a timely opportunity to gain early exposure to a high-potential meme layer on Bitcoin.

As Bitcoin steals headlines with six-figure milestones, savvy investors are already turning their attention to what’s happening underneath the surface: an early altseason shift powered by wallet growth, on-chain activity, and breakout fundamentals. In May 2025, the altcoin landscape is showing signs of life across nearly every major metric. From increased transaction volume on Ethereum, to cross-chain engagement on Solana, the building blocks for the next big moves are already in place. One early standout? Dawgz AI —an under-$0.005 altcoin that merges meme culture with real AI utility. While it’s still in presale, its early momentum, staking features, and automated trading tools are drawing attention from investors ready to move before the next big breakout. But here’s the kicker—less than 2% of crypto investors are tracking one of the strongest indicators of future growth: wallet retention. It’s time to stop chasing noise and start following signals. Why Wallet Retention Signals the Smart Money Everyone watches price. Few watch what really matters—who’s sticking around. Here’s why wallet retention counts: It reveals long-term holders: A coin with thousands of active wallets, even during downturns, means belief in the project. It shows real use cases: High retention plus on-chain interaction equals real engagement—not just speculative spikes. It filters out fluff: Viral coins may pump fast, but smart investors focus on stickiness. If you’re building a portfolio of the best altcoins to buy, this is one stat you can’t afford to ignore. How to Build an Altcoin Portfolio That Works in 2025 Looking to avoid hype traps? Here’s a simple way to balance ambition with smart risk management: Mix utility and upside: Hold reliable performers like XRP, while positioning early in coins like Dawgz AI. Diversify sectors: DeFi, gaming, AI, and infrastructure tokens each offer unique growth paths. Avoid single-chain risk: Favor cross-chain projects that tap into multiple ecosystems. Prioritize security: Look for smart contract audits, active GitHubs, and transparent teams. Anchor with ETH or BTC: While not altcoins, they stabilize portfolio swings. Why Celebrities Are Focusing on Altcoins in 2025 In 2021, they bought Bitcoin . In 2025, they’re buying into altcoins with utility. Why? Lower cost of entry: Most altcoins are far more accessible than Bitcoin’s five-figure price tag. Brand alignment: Community-driven tokens allow artists, creators, and influencers to connect more directly with fans. More innovation: From AI trading bots to NFT utilities, altcoins are pushing crypto’s boundaries faster than BTC can. This shift is more than trend-chasing—it’s recognition that the best altcoins to buy now are also the ones driving the next generation of crypto use cases. The Best Altcoins to Buy Now Ready to go beyond headlines? These three tokens are showing all the early signals of 2025’s altseason: Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) AI utility meets meme coin virality Dawgz AI is one of 2025’s most compelling early-stage altcoins. It fuses viral branding with real AI-backed tools, giving it a foundation beyond just hype. Presale Price: $0.004 Funds Raised: $3.5M+ Platform: Ethereum Audit: SolidProof verified What Makes It Special: AI-Powered Trading: Automated tools that scan markets and execute trades in real time. Staking Live During Presale: Investors can earn passive rewards from day one. Cross-Chain Friendly: Supports ETH, BNB Chain, Solana, and others. Strong Community Focus: The growing “Dawgz Army” drives organic marketing and engagement. With its low entry price, early adoption, and working product roadmap, Dawgz AI is more than just a meme—it’s a functioning altcoin with long-term plans. XRP XRP remains a pillar in the altcoin market, loved for its institutional-grade speed and ongoing legal clarity. In 2025, it continues to lead in cross-border payments and settlement platforms. Current Price: $2.40 Market Cap: $138B Focus: International payments and banking integrations Why It’s Still a Power Pick: Regulated and recognized in multiple countries Used by major financial institutions High transaction speed and scalability If you want an altcoin that blends stability with adoption, XRP is as solid as they come. Cardano (ADA) Slow and steady wins the blockchain race Cardano doesn’t aim to be flashy—it aims to be functional, with a heavy focus on peer-reviewed development and scalable infrastructure. Key Features: Proof-of-Stake protocol Strong academic backing Smart contract support ADA isn’t as loud as meme coins, but it’s trusted, audited, and continues to roll out upgrades that push blockchain toward mainstream utility. Why Dawgz AI Deserves Extra Attention After events like TOKEN2049 and increased coverage from early influencers, Dawgz AI is one of the only meme-style tokens gaining traction without losing focus on actual utility. Here’s why it’s a front-runner among the best altcoins to buy: Active staking rewards Audit-backed trust Growing wallet retention Built-in AI innovation Sub-$0.005 price point As TikTok trends around meme coins continue, Dawgz AI sits at the perfect intersection of low entry cost, hype potential, and actual use case. Final Thoughts When it comes to finding the best altcoins to buy now, it pays to think like the top 2%—focus on wallet retention, ecosystem health, and early metrics that often predict future growth. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain anchors, it’s altcoins like Dawgz AI, XRP, and Cardano that give investors something else: room to grow.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Crypto Price Analysis 5-16: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, NEAR PROTOCOL: NEAR, COSMOS: ATOM","The crypto market registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies rebounded after a sluggish week. BTC had dropped to a low of $101,432 on Monday before rebounding to $103,820. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $104,100. Ethereum (ETH) also recovered, registering a marginal increase and moving to $2,587. However, Ripple (XRP) registered a sharp decline after a US Court denied the SEC and Ripple’s request to lift an injunction prohibiting XRP sales to institutional investors, dropping over 4%. Solana (SOL) also registered a notable decline, falling nearly 2% to $171. Dogecoin (DOGE) also traded in the red, down over 2%, while Cardano registered a marginal decline and settled at $0.783. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend and registered an increase of nearly 2% in the past 24 hours. Fed Chair Says Zero-Interest Rates Unlikely To Return Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that new market realities mean zero or near-zero percent interest rates are unlikely to return. Speaking on Thursday, Fed Chair Powell warned about impending supply shocks that would keep interest rates higher. “Higher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s. We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks — a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.” Powell’s remarks about impending supply shocks echoed earlier statements in response to President Donald Trump’s tariff and trade policy. The Fed Chair had earlier warned that the volatility of US trade policy could lead to slower growth and higher inflation. Powell noted that in such a scenario, it would be unclear which of the two the Fed would need to respond to on priority. The statement comes despite President Trump’s unyielding pressure on Powell to lower interest rates. FTX Announces Second Round Of Distributions To Eligible Creditors Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX announced plans to begin a second distribution worth $5 billion to eligible creditors. The amount will go to holders of allowed claims under FTX’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The distribution will cover eligible creditors in Convenience and Non-Convenience classes. However, the disbursement of the funds will be limited to FTX creditors who have completed the required pre-distribution processes. The defunct exchange announced the news in a post on X, stating, “FTX today announced it is set to distribute more than $5 billion in its Second Distribution to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes that have completed the pre-distribution requirements on May 30, 2025.” The exchange announced the initial distribution phase in February 2025, setting the date for the next distribution as April 11, 2025. The second distribution plan included a record for allowed claims with Class 5 customer entitlement claims and Class 6 general unsecured claims. It also covered holders of convenience claims that were allowed but not yet received. John J. Ray III, plan administrator of the FTX Recovery Trust, noted, “These first non-convenience class distributions are an important milestone for FTX. The scope and magnitude of the FTX creditor base make this an unprecedented distribution process, and today’s announcement reflects the outstanding success of the recovery and coordination efforts of our team of professionals. Our focus remains on recovering more for creditors and resolving outstanding claims.” 90% Of Financial Institutions Use Stablecoins Stablecoin adoption has registered a significant jump, with as many as 90% of financial institutions using them for day-to-day operations, according to the Fireblocks’ State of Stablecoins 2025 report. The report draws on responses from global banks, fintech, and payment providers using Fireblocks’ infrastructure. Fireblocks processes over 35 million stablecoin transactions in a month, making up 15% of global stablecoin volume. Coinbase Hit By Cyber Attack Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US has revealed that a recent cyberattack could cost the platform $400 million. The exchange revealed it was contacted by hackers who claimed to have access to customer information. The hackers accessed the information by making payments to Coinbase employees and contractors. According to an official blog post, the hackers gained access to less than 1% of customer data, which they used to trick users into surrendering their crypto. The hackers demanded $20 million from Coinbase to keep the matter under wraps. However, Coinbase refused to pay the bribe, instead promising to repay every customer who was scammed. Coinbase’s disclosure led to a 4.1% in its share price. The attack comes only days after the exchange disclosed it will join the benchmark S&P 500 Index. The attack also shows how the crypto industry has become the target of hackers and elaborate fraud schemes as it continues to register record growth. Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo, stated, “Security remains a challenge for the crypto industry despite its growing mainstream acceptance. As our nascent industry grows rapidly, it draws the eye of bad actors, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated in the scope of their attacks.” Coinbase also stated that it is establishing a $20 million reward fund for information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the hackers responsible for the attack. “We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker. We're cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received. Instead, we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) briefly climbed above $104,000 during the ongoing session but fell back as traders maintained a cautious outlook around the $105,000 resistance. The overall market sentiment around BTC remains positive despite buyer exhaustion as BTC trades near key technical and psychological levels. The flagship cryptocurrency trades just under the $104,000 mark as traders await the next catalyst to dictate price action. While BTC’s rally has taken a breather in recent sessions, JPMorgan analysts believe BTC could outperform gold in the second half of 2025. Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, stated, “Bitcoin has continued to trade within a range between the $101,700 support and $104,800 resistance levels, maintaining its position above the critical $100K mark for the seventh consecutive day. BTC ETFs recorded outflows totaling $295 million.” Despite its inability to move past $105,000 thanks to profit-taking and selling pressure, BTC remained above $100,000 thanks to optimism over easing trade tensions between the US and China and the announcement of a trade deal between the US and UK. Consumer price index numbers were also softer than expected, easing inflationary pressure from trade tariffs. US producer prices also unexpectedly declined in April, driven by the sharpest drop in service costs since April. Lower inflation and reduced interest rates typically weaken the US Dollar, making assets like Bitcoin more attractive. A dovish stance by the Fed also boosts risk appetite, driving investors towards risky and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. BTC started the previous week positively, rising 0.40% on Monday. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising over 2% to cross $96,000 and settle at $96,845. BTC registered a marginal increase on Wednesday to cross $97,000 and settle at $97,005. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday after the US-UK trade deal. As a result, BTC rallied over 6%, surging past the $100,000 mark and settling at $103,096. However, it lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal decline, slipping below $103,000 and settling at $102,851. BTC was back in bullish territory Saturday, rising almost 2% to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,617. Source: TradingView Despite positive price action on Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 1% to $013,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped 1.04% to $102,728, but not before falling to an intraday low of $100,694. Price action was back in positive territory on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at 104,123. Sellers returned to the market on Wednesday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,432 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,820. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1% and trading at $103,276. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded during the ongoing session after registering a substantial drop on Wednesday and Thursday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency trades under $2,600 after dropping to a low of 2,480 on Thursday. Despite the price increase during the ongoing session, daily trading volume registered a drop of 1.07%, indicating waning demand. Demand could pick up if ETH reclaims $2,700, potentially fueling a rally to $3,000. Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, stated, “Ethereum is showing signs of a breakout setup, with $2,735 as a key resistance level to watch. Overall, while short-term volatility is possible, current price action suggests a consolidation phase that could precede the next leg up in this bull cycle.” ETH’s price action was muted at the beginning of the previous week, registering a marginal increase on Monday before dropping 0.22% and 0.26% on Tuesday and Wednesday to settle at $1,812. However, markets rallied on Thursday, and ETH surged nearly 22% to cross $2,000 and settle at $2,206. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,489 as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the momentum, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $2,345 after an increase of over 6%. Buyers retained control on Saturday as ETH rose over 10% to cross $2,500 and settle at 2,585. However, price action turned bearish on Sunday as ETH fell nearly 3% to $2,514.

The current session sees ETH up over 1% and trading at $2,579. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) faced rejection at the key $180-$185 levels despite briefly rising to an intraday high of $184 on Thursday. The altcoin sits at a critical juncture as it faces selling pressure at higher levels. SOL could not sustain its move past $180, immediately falling, indicating that sellers are fiercely defending upper levels and increasing the likelihood of a retracement towards $150 or lower. SOL registered a notable increase last Monday, rising nearly 2% to $146. Price action remained muted on Tuesday and Wednesday as SOL registered marginal increases and moved to $147. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday after President Trump announced the US-UK trade deal. As a result, SOL rallied nearly 12% to cross $160 and settle at $164. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose over 5% and settled at $172. SOL continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing nearly 3% to $177. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, dropping almost 3% and settling at $173. Source: TradingView SOL started the week facing volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $174. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $165 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 5.50% to cross the 200-day SMA and $180 and settle at $183. Buyer exhaustion set in on Wednesday, and SOL fell nearly 4%, slipping below $180 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $176. The price declined on Thursday, dropping over 4% to $169. SOL has recovered during the ongoing session and is up over 1%, trading around $171.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation. Robinhood is committed to leading this trend under a compliant framework,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said.Related: SEC Chair: Blockchain ‘holds promise’ of new kinds of market activityTokenization gains momentumRobinhood’s proposal comes amid a renewed wave of interest in RWA tokenization, with major players from both traditional finance and crypto making headlines last week.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a blockchain-based share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, allowing a digital ledger to mirror investor ownership.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

2025-05-20T09:25:23.000Z,"South Korean presidential front-runner proposes won-based stablecoin","South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty.Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.“We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,” Lee reportedly said.Related: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsSouth Korean candidates make pro-crypto promisesThe proposal is part of Lee’s broader digital asset strategy, which includes legalizing spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Both Lee and rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party have pledged to support the introduction of spot crypto ETFs.Source: Konstantin TkachukLee’s campaign also calls for the National Pension Fund and other institutional players to be allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies once price stability criteria are met.To facilitate this, he proposed an integrated monitoring system and lower transaction fees, making crypto more accessible under government oversight.However, the stablecoin proposal has sparked concern among economists.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions.

Binance had argued that it isn’t beholden to US securities laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in the country.The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned that decision in March 2024, and the Supreme Court later declined to hear Binance's appeal in January of that year.Related: US judge transfers Binance lawsuit to Florida, citing first-to-file ruleBinance’s legal entanglements in the US have escalated since mid-2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for selling unregistered securities, which was settled for $4.3 billion in November 2023.Binance was also slapped with a class action in Canada in April 2024 for allegedly violating securities laws after it announced its departure from the country in May 2023.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-wants-arbitration-members-securities-class-suit?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio.

Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin.

However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held.

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

He suggested that the financial regulator  would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”Even before Atkins stepped into the role of SEC chair, the commission’s actions under Donald Trump suggested that it would radically depart from the direction of former chair Gary Gensler. In 2025, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies and issued guidance on memecoins and security tokens.Related: CFTC commissioner to leave agency on May 31“As I begin my tenure as Chairman, I can tell you that we are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation,” said Atkins. “The markets innovate, and the SEC should not be in the business of telling them to stand still.”Looking to Congress for market structureAtkins’ remarks came as US lawmakers considered draft legislation to establish a regulatory structure for crypto markets.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart.

The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls.

If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart.

If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus.

Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites.

Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency.

The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX.

In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market.

2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download.A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T08:46:53.000Z,"Apple KYC glitch on Bybit draws swift executive response to recover $100K","Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said it had involved team members, including an executive, to fix a glitch that affected a single user who could not go through an Apple-based know-your-client (KYC) system.In a May 18 X post, the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins. This statement is meant to remind Bitcoin — and now crypto — users that real control over assets comes only with control over the private keys that allow for signing transactions.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bybit-fixes-kyc-glitch-100-k-crypto-recovery?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
