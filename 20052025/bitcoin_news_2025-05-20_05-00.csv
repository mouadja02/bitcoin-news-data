2025-05-20T02:26:57.000Z,"Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suit","Crypto exchange Binance has asked a US federal judge to send all members of a class-action lawsuit alleging it sold securities to arbitration, arguing that the group waived their ability to form a class action under the company’s terms. The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange . “The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of Plaintiffs’ claims,” Binance said. Binance argues that its terms of service have a clause about users agreeing to arbitrate all claims. Source: PACER In March, Judge Andrew Carter denied Binance’s request to have all of the class action’s claims sent to arbitration for users who bought tokens on the exchange between April 1, 2017, and Feb. 20, 2019, and partially denied the motion for users who bought tokens after 2019 until a decision could be made to what extend the arbitration clause would apply. Binance said in its latest filings that it updated its terms in February 2019 to include the arbitration clause and argued that an earlier version of the terms of service included a clause that informed users that Binance could amend the terms as needed without any individual notice.. Binance case was previously dismissed Judge Carter had sided with Binance and dismissed the suit in March 2022. Binance had argued that it isn’t beholden to US securities laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in the country. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned that decision in March 2024 , and the Supreme Court later declined to hear Binance's appeal in January of that year. Related: US judge transfers Binance lawsuit to Florida, citing first-to-file rule Binance’s legal entanglements in the US have escalated since mid-2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for selling unregistered securities, which was settled for $4.3 billion in November 2023. Binance was also slapped with a class action in Canada in April 2024 for allegedly violating securities laws after it announced its departure from the country in May 2023.

2025-05-20T02:15:24.000Z,"Avalanche Hits $22.80, Tezos Reinvents with Uranium—But Qubetics Might Be the Best Crypto to Buy for May 2025","After surging past $106,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin sharply retreated by nearly 4% to $102,300, triggering over $670 million in crypto futures liquidations—$465 million of which were long positions.

Arthur Breitman’s Bet on Tokenized Uranium Could Signal a Tezos Revival Arthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, is placing a bold bet on tokenized uranium—a move that could mark a pivotal comeback for the once-hyped “Ethereum killer.” In a recent interview, Breitman reflected on Tezos’ evolution from a top-10 crypto project to a more subdued but resilient player in the blockchain space, now targeting the Real World Asset (RWA) sector. With its unique self-amending protocol and strong emphasis on decentralization, Tezos is aiming to reinvent itself by enabling secure and transparent uranium tokenization. Breitman emphasizes Tezos’ culture of “doing things for real,” contrasting its genuinely decentralized infrastructure with other projects driven by hype or custodial models. While Tezos has endured regulatory hurdles, shifting narratives, and market skepticism, its pivot toward tokenizing critical assets like uranium could redefine its place in the crypto ecosystem and reignite developer and institutional interest. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 21%, But Ruvi AI (RUVI) Emerges as 2025’s Breakout Star with $2 Price Prediction and 20,000% Growth Forecast Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a significant 21% surge, hitting $22.80 amid growing adoption and bullish momentum, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $30.01 by 2030. However, market analysts are increasingly turning their attention to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a disruptive decentralized AI superapp that’s making waves with its innovative integration of Web3 technology. With a successful presale already under its belt—where early investors earned 50% gains—RUVI is now priced at just $0.015, yet experts forecast the token could reach $2 in 2025, representing a staggering 20,000% ROI. Combining blockchain utility with AI-driven content creation tools for text, video, audio, and images, Ruvi is quickly gaining traction as the next major player in the crypto space.

2025-05-20T02:00:26.000Z,"Analyst Alert: XRP, Bitcoin, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Quietly Dominating 2025 Portfolio Rebalancing","Introduction Bitcoin remains the benchmark for crypto portfolios, but 2025 is seeing a decisive shift as analysts and investors rebalance toward the next wave of high-conviction altcoins. XRP and Solana are drawing renewed attention, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum is turning heads among those seeking asymmetric upside. With Kaspa joining the list of contenders, the smart money is quietly positioning for the next phase of the bull cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE has stormed into the 2025 cycle with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, all while its token price remains under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and Hashex-audited smart contracts have created a scarcity-driven model that’s fueling strong demand and rapid presale sellouts.Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models calling for even more if momentum continues. Whale allocations and a unique blend of political narrative and structured tokenomics are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP is trading at $2.33 as of May 19, 2025, after a 3.3% dip, but the launch of CME Group’s XRP futures and Ripple’s expansion into the UAE are driving institutional interest. Despite short-term price pressure, analysts remain bullish, with targets of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate.As XRP holders seek further upside, many are also rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve is just beginning. Bitcoin: New Highs and Growing Demand Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,005, having closed the week above $106,000 for the first time ever and maintaining its position as the market’s anchor. With technical forecasts calling for a move to $114,289 in May and long-term projections as high as $210,000–$230,000 for 2025, institutional inflows and ETF demand are keeping sentiment bullish.As Bitcoin’s growth steadies, investors are increasingly seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is trading at $171.54, up 3.38% from yesterday, and continues to be one of the strongest Layer-1 performers this cycle. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest a range between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond.As Solana’s fundamentals remain robust, some SOL holders are rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. Kaspa: Quietly Building Momentum Kaspa (KAS) is quietly gaining traction in 2025, with its proof-of-work model and expanding ecosystem attracting new capital. While not as high-profile as Bitcoin or Solana, KAS is being watched by analysts as a potential breakout candidate for the second half of the year.As capital rotates, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion While Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana remain foundational to any crypto portfolio, the search for the next breakout is intensifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the bold, high-upside pick that’s catching analyst attention as Stage 8 nears completion.With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and a narrowing entry window, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining early-stage opportunity of the 2025 cycle.

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said. Michael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market. “I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.” “If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

2025-05-20T01:30:58.000Z,"Is Panama City Next? Mayor Teases Bitcoin Reserve After Diplomatic Exchange","Panama City’s mayor stirred up talk this week when he hinted at building a city‑level Bitcoin fund . It all started with a single line on social media. Mayer Mizrachi wrote “Bitcoin Reserve” on X on May 16. He’d just met with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, two of the big names behind El Salvador’s Bitcoin moves. Meeting Sparks Curious Talk According to local sources, Mizrachi sat down with Keiser and Herbert to go over the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin policy. The mayor was tight‑lipped about details. But the timing was notable. He shared that post just before heading to the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. It seemed like a heads‑up that something more could be coming. Bitcoin Reserve — Mayer Mizrachi (@Mayer) May 16, 2025 Legal Hurdles Ahead Based on reports, creating a formal Bitcoin reserve would need a vote in Panama’s National Assembly. Lawmakers would have to write and approve a bill first. That process can drag on. Committees must study the idea. There’d be debates, amendments and budget checks. Only then could the city hold any stash of Bitcoin on its books. Panama City to introduce El Salvador’s “What is Money” financial literacy schoolbooks to their new digital libraries. A regional Central American bitcoin block is emerging! pic.twitter.com/7Ra2RvDdsG — Stacy Herbert (@stacyherbert) May 15, 2025 Energy Plans Discussed Energy was also on the table. Keiser pointed out Panama’s hydroelectric potential and El Salvador ’s geothermal plants. He suggested that green energy could power Bitcoin mining rigs. It’s a neat idea: use cheap, clean power to run the computers that keep the Bitcoin network ticking. But permits and grid upgrades would be needed. Companies and regulators would have to sign off. Crypto Payments On The Horizon Mizrachi has already said Panama City will accept Bitcoin, Ether, Tether and USDC once the payments system is ready. That means building the crypto‑to‑fiat rails. Banks or fintech partners must handle the exchange. And secure wallets would be needed to store any coins the city takes in. No launch date’s been set. But the plan is on the agenda. Companies Bulk Up Holdings It’s not just governments eyeing Bitcoin. Public firms are piling in, too. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Corp. just said it would raise $84 billion to buy more Bitcoin. That includes selling another $21 billion in stock. They’ve also lifted their debt limit from $21 billion to $42 billion, with $14.6 billion still open. On the other side of the globe, Metaplanet added 1,240 BTC—about 18.50 billion yen, or roughly $127 million. That brings its total to 6,797 BTC, now worth just over $706 million. Based on reports, publicly listed firms increased their Bitcoin stash by 15% in Q1. It shows that many see Bitcoin as a core holding—not just a side bet.

2025-05-20T01:30:10.000Z,"Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top","Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been marked by a highly volatile phase that saw it briefly reach above the $106,000 mark. However, this was followed by a return to consolidation around the $103,000 price level. This intense volatility in the past 24 hours suggests that the Bitcoin price still has a long way to go before it reaches a price top. Amid this volatile movement, a new macroeconomic model, the Decode Macro Trend Oscillator (MTO), has pointed out when to expect Bitcoin’s price to top this cycle. Decode’s Macro Trend Oscillator Model And Its Alignment With Bitcoin Peaks The Decode Macro Trend Oscillator is a sophisticated tool designed by a Bitcoin analyst known as Decode on the social media platform X. The oscillator aggregates around 40 macroeconomic indicators, ranging from interest rates and global liquidity to industrial production and market volatility, into 17 carefully selected leading metrics. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now These are then normalized and visualized as a histogram to produce a cyclical pattern that has historically aligned with Bitcoin’s major tops. A close look at the chart titled Bitcoin Liquid Index on the 1M candlestick timeframe reveals that the light green histogram bars have coincided with each of Bitcoin’s cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These peaks are marked by vertical red lines, and the transitions from deep red to green territory on the oscillator appear to offer a visual cue for the end of bearish phases and the onset of price rallies. As of May 2025, the histogram remains in a deep red zone but has begun inching upward, with the most recent bar reading at -11.47, suggesting that macroeconomic conditions may soon start to favor a bigger rally for Bitcoin. BTC Mode Configuration Fine-Tunes Cycle Top Prediction Decode’s analysis goes beyond Bitcoin-specific indicators. In one of the accompanying charts of the S&P 500 Index of the 2M timeframe, a long-term comparison is made between the current global environment and the economic backdrop of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Interestingly, Decode’s macro trend oscillator proved reliable in estimating periods of downturns and expansions in both instances. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength In both instances, inflation pressure and declining consumer sentiment pushed the oscillator deep into negative territory for years. However, once the histogram flipped into the green, the economy and prices entered a prolonged phase of expansion. The third chart offers a more detailed view of Bitcoin’s weekly trend, including an overlay of M2 money supply growth, which is another popular monetary metric. This view highlights how the Macro Trend Oscillator, when switched to a configuration Decode called “Bitcoin Mode,” fine-tunes its sensitivity to metrics that directly impact crypto markets. In this configuration, only a few of the full 17 metrics that best identify Bitcoin cycle tops are used. As it stands, Bitcoin is still in the negative red histogram zone, even despite its rally in recent months. The first deep green histogram has yet to show up, not to mention the first light green bar that will mark the cycle peak. Based on this setup, the oscillator implies that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run this cycle, and that a price top is unlikely to arrive in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,300.

2025-05-20T00:15:19.000Z,"Ripple CEO slams Senator Lummis for snubbing meeting","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has raised concerns after a scheduled meeting with U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent Bitcoin supporter, was canceled with no rescheduling offer. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., where he advocates for balanced and inclusive digital asset regulations, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment on X (formerly Twitter). “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” Garlinghouse wrote, inviting Senator Lummis to join him for a public discussion via X Spaces or a live event . He stressed the importance of supporting all blockchain networks—not just Bitcoin—especially given Lummis chairs the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee and represents Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly stance. Crypto community divides as Garlinghouse challenges Senator Lummis’s Bitcoin-only focus Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore continuing fears that Bitcoin is making other digital assets and the firms that help develop blockchain technology obsolete. The scrapped meeting drew reactions from members of the crypto community. Some accused the Senator of being biased and expressed frustration over her stance. On X, user @DarkScarf89 expressed curiosity as to why the Senator had refused a meeting, pointing to a divergence in support of a level playing field that might not quite match the Bitcoin-only narrative. Bitcoin maximalists, however, lauded Lummis. Troy Cross thanked her “for fighting against the scammers,” a move that could suggest skepticism toward Ripple and its XRP token. This conversation illustrates the friction that exists between Bitcoin maximalists and proponents of a wider, more welcoming regulatory strategy. Industry participants increasingly demand models that apply to all digital assets, not only Bitcoin. The scandal has done little to waver Senator Lummis’ love for Bitcoin. She has advocated that Americans consider Bitcoin a long-term investment , a hedge against inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar. “I encourage people to save Bitcoin for their retirement, for their future,” Lummis recently stated. Her strong Bitcoin focus has earned both praise from the Bitcoin community and criticism from other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Nonetheless, Lummis has worked collaboratively on crypto legislation beyond Bitcoin. She and Senator Bernie Moreno co-introduced a bill to improve digital asset tax treatment. They expressed frustration over the bipartisan GENIUS Act’s failure to pass—a bill designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. CME XRP futures ignite demand for Spot ETF approval and regulatory clarity Today’s launch of CME XRP futures shifts attention to the pending approval of a spot XRP ETF. With futures trading attracting institutional interest, regulatory clarity on XRP-related products is increasingly urgent. Garlinghouse previously expressed optimism that a spot XRP ETF could be approved by the end of 2025, especially following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC. Meanwhile, analysts like Fred Rispoli note XRP’s potential role in a proposed digital asset reserve outlined in a Trump-era executive order, adding another layer of complexity to XRP’s regulatory outlook. Garlinghouse backs pro-crypto legislation as Senate prepares to debate stablecoin bill Ripple CEO told his followers on X that he was heading to Washington to support what he called “sensible pro-crypto” legislation focused on stablecoins and market structure. He said he was encouraged to see lawmakers recognizing crypto as a multichain industry “as it should be.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin. They are typically pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or commodities like gold. On December 17, 2024, Ripple launched its own stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). Senator Cynthia Lummis, a well-known crypto advocate, previously introduced the BITCOIN Act, which proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She recently said senators have agreed on the final wording of new Senate stablecoin legislation and expects the bill to reach the floor next week. The bill in question is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), it is co-sponsored by Senators Lummis, Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The GENIUS bill has faced roadblocks — most notably due to Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), opposing it — owing to President Donald Trump-linked USD1 stablecoin .

2025-05-20T00:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says","Unlike previous market rallies, the latest rebound in Bitcoin (BTC) – pushing it from a potential cycle low of $74,508 on April 6 to slightly above $100,000 at the time of writing – is characterized by healthier price movement. Current Bitcoin Rally Not Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktakes post by contributor avocado_onchain, last year’s BTC bull cycle – which saw the leading cryptocurrency create and break multiple all-time highs (ATHs) – was accompanied by sharp spikes in Binance market buy volume and funding rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic RSI Signals Brewing Bullish Momentum – ATH Incoming? Notably, a sudden increase in funding rates was twice followed by a sharp price pullback due to overheating. In this context, overheating refers to excessive bullish leverage in futures markets that drives up the cost of long positions, signalling overly aggressive sentiment that often precedes a market correction. The following chart illustrates these corrections triggered by excessive leverage in BTC futures. Specifically, boxes 1 and 2 show sharp rises in Binance funding rates, initially accompanied by price increases, then extended periods of correction. However, the current rally appears different. According to avocado_onchain, Bitcoin’s ongoing rebound is occurring without an overheated funding rate. In fact, Binance market buy volume is trending downward – as shown in box 3 of the chart – which contrasts with previous bull cycles. The analyst argues that these are signs of a healthier rally, as earlier bull runs were marked by overheated funding rates and abrupt corrections, which weakened investor sentiment. In contrast, the current rally has maintained relatively stable funding rates, suggesting more cautious and sustainable market behavior. Despite short-term price fluctuations, market buy volume has shown a steady upward trend since 2023, as marked by the yellow arrow in the chart. The analyst notes: This indicates that buying sentiment remains favorable for further upside, suggesting that it’s not yet time to consider an exit. We can’t predict exactly when Bitcoin will break its previous high, but current on-chain and market data signals remain very constructive. Other Indicators Point Toward New ATH Besides the stable funding rates and encouraging market buy volumes, BTC is also showing several other positive signs pointing toward a new ATH for the flagship digital asset in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says For example, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are not selling, even as BTC trades near its previous ATH of $108,786, recorded in January. This behavior suggests that these investors anticipate further upside. That said, analysts caution against overly optimistic expectations, noting that Bitcoin may still be far from experiencing a true supply shock. At press time, BTC is trading at $102,393, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-20T00:00:23.000Z,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Just Hit Analysts’ 2025 Radar With 15,000% Potential Upside","Introduction As the crypto market charges into Q2 2025, momentum is building around a select group of assets showing both strength and strategic upside. Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, Ethereum is surging to new highs, and investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With XRP, TON, and Solana also attracting capital, the altcoin market is entering a new phase of speculation and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Could these tokens deliver the next 15,000% run-up? Let’s break down the leaders that are capturing analysts’ attention right now-and the altcoin that’s turning heads as its listing nears. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $103,405, consolidating after a volatile weekend but holding above key support. Analysts from Unchained and Changelly forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end 2025, with an average price prediction for May around $120,555. Institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and a maturing macro backdrop are fueling bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and unique political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Key highlights : Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion token cap, 45% in presale HashEx-audited contracts and strong grassroots momentum Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with $1 as a stretch target As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity-one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and Layer-2 Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators are bullish, with ETH breaking above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern. If ETH can close above the $2,700 resistance, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. Institutional adoption, DeFi growth, and Layer-2 upgrades are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. XRP: Institutional Flows and Bullish Projections XRP is trading at $2.33 and attracting whale accumulation, with over 880 million tokens acquired by large holders in May. Analysts expect a breakout to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with long-term targets as high as $12.50 if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. While XRP’s setup is strong, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. Toncoin and Solana: Quiet Strength and Technical Upside Toncoin (TON) is trading near $2.84, with forecasts for 2025 ranging from $2.77 to $2.96 and technical analysis pointing to steady growth as adoption increases. Solana (SOL) is holding at $172, consolidating after its 80% rally from recent lows, with analysts targeting $250–$400 as the next major resistance zone. As both TON and SOL maintain bullish structures, investors are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for the kind of early-stage momentum that can deliver outsized gains. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge, Ethereum’s bullish breakout, and the institutional momentum behind XRP, TON, and Solana, the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential and 15,000% upside. With a clear listing roadmap, robust investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing-and smart investors are already taking notice.

2025-05-19T23:30:18.000Z,"Final Pre-Listing Window? XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Dominating Whale Accumulation in May","Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales accumulate select tokens. XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this movement, with on-chain data confirming high-conviction buying. Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating 83,100 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. This strategic accumulation is happening as retail investors take profits, signaling growing institutional confidence. As BTC’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen whale accumulation surge as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project is audited by Hashex, features a capped 100 billion token supply, and offers scarcity-driven tokenomics. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next key resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Smart Money Bets on a Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading near $171, with whales accumulating over 61,000 SOL in recent months, signaling strong confidence in a potential price surge. Major smart money addresses have returned, making multi-million dollar purchases at current levels. As Solana’s whales build positions, many investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar early-stage momentum and breakout potential. HBAR: Institutional Interest and Uptrend Potential Hedera (HBAR) is trading at $0.19, with whale accumulation accelerating alongside XRP in early 2025. Analysts highlight the potential for a major rally if current support holds, especially with ETF speculation and institutional flows on the rise. In this environment, many are diversifying into high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of growth. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge.

Solana: Bullish Patterns and Institutional Optimism Solana (SOL) is priced at $171.54 as of May 19, 2025, consolidating just below resistance after a recent climb.

Avalanche: DeFi Growth and Technical Strength Avalanche (AVAX) is trading around $22.58, with analysts forecasting an average of $19.74 for May and a potential peak of $22.58.

On-chain data shows the number of non-zero SOL addresses recently hit a new all-time high. Solana (SOL) price has regained bullish momentum since early April 2025. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $99.8 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $6 billion, has formed higher highs and higher lows in the past seven weeks, thus signaling a rising trend in the higher timeframe. The rising SOL trend coincides with the Bitcoin price rebound above $100k amid an anticipated reversal of the BTC’e weekly dominance. Furthermore, the rising crypto optimism favors an altseason in the coming months, bolstered by the notable rebound of Ether against BTC . Solana Network Records Mixed Fundamentals The Solana network remains a key player in the DeFi space, mostly in the memecoin ecosystem. The rising adoption of Solana-based memecoins has helped increase the non-zero SOL address in the recent past. According to on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, the number of Solana wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 11.16 million. Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposed Solana ETF on Monday for further review and consultations. Midterm Expectations for SOL Price After hitting a local target of above $174 in the past two weeks, the SOL price has been trapped in a short-term correction. In the 1-hour timeframe, SOL price has formed a parallel symmetrical falling trend in the past few days. Following Monday’s SOL price rebound from the lower border of the symmetrical falling trend, SOL price is positioned to rally towards the upper border in the coming days. A potential close above the symmetrical falling trend will propel SOL price towards the next short-term target of above $200. However, a further correction, in the coming days, will likely dump SOL price towards the next significant support level above $157.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-price-prediction-rising-network-adoption-may-push-sol-price-beyond-200-by-may/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING","Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T22:57:18.000Z,"Bitcoin trading in six-figure territory shows BTC is ready to carry gold’s ‘baton’ — Fidelity exec","Key takeaways: Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role. Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty. Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender. Timmer’s recent analysis highlights a convergence in the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two assets are increasingly comparable in risk-adjusted returns. The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility. The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms.

For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic n ewsletter , pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated, “Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

Additionally, the analysis added that Bitcoin performed better as a “high-beta growth asset,” thriving in rising liquidity and fiat debasement environments. Recent developments signal a shift: US trade policy clarity, a softer Federal Reserve stance, and easing financial conditions have spurred steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs.

The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025.

Given that Tornado Cash is also non-custodial, Storm’s team argues that the government is going against its own stance by indicting the crypto developer . “The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this court,” the letter reads. U.S. Prosecutors Defend Their Stance Meanwhile, prosecutors are pushing back on the defense’s claims after Storm’s team expressed “concern about the government’s belated disclosures in the Samourai case” in a May 8 letter. “The Government disclosed all known substantive communications between the prosecution team and FinCEN regarding Samourai Wallet months in advance of pretrial motions and trial,” U.S. prosecutors said in a recent filing. “Indeed, the defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they added. “Nothing more is warranted.” U.S. Sees Changing Crypto Regulations The controversial Tornado Cash case comes amid shifting crypto regulations in the United States as President Donald Trump relaxes rulemaking on the blockchain sector .

According to analyst Trader Tardigrade, Bitcoin has been rising in $10,000 chunks, then taking short breaks. He pointed out moves from $75,000 to $85,000, then to $95,000, and again to $105,000. Each jump is followed by seven to 10 days of sideways action. #Bitcoin is climbing steadily, with intervals of around 10k in each consolidation 🔥$BTC pic.twitter.com/stEgE5NkQH — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 16, 2025 This stair-step pattern isn’t just a lucky guess. It gives traders a chance to breathe, take profits, or set new entries. These pauses can also turn into support zones—levels where buyers step in again. If the same behavior continues, the next target could be $115,000, which is about an 11% jump from where Bitcoin is now. Price Holding Above $100K Gives Bulls Confidence Trading above $100,000 is no small feat. Holding that level gives Bitcoin some strength and psychological support. The more time it spends above this line, the more likely buyers feel safe to enter. Last week’s move was modest, only about a 0.50% gain, but that followed a strong 11% surge earlier in May. Some market watchers think this slow and steady growth is a healthy sign. Instead of wild swings, Bitcoin is showing more controlled movement.

According to a new press release from BounceBit, the collaboration mixes traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure, allowing investors to leverage traditional yields with crypto derivatives trading. Per the announcement, the strategy involves executing Bitcoin ( BTC ) and stablecoin trades with BUIDL as collateral. BounceBit says the trading strategy could raise total annual percentage yield (APY) for investors by 24%. BUIDL is a BlackRock private fund, which is tokenized by Securitize and made available through its Securitize Markets. According to a post to the social media platform X, the strategy is “the first active use-case for tokenized treasuries.” Says Jack Lu, Founder & CEO at BounceBit, “This innovative approach demonstrates what is possible when investors simultaneously capture both U.S. dollar yields and funding rate arbitrage returns, potentially creating opportunities for institutional investors seeking sustainable USD-denominated yield generation across market cycles.” Last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said that the tokenization of RWAs on blockchains will develop stronger links between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi). In a paper on the financial stability risks of crypto, BIS analysts say that RWAs – or the tokenization of traditional assets on distributed ledgers – are creating an increased connection between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi).

The malware, linked from Procolored’s own support site, swapped copied Bitcoin addresses to redirect funds to attackers, netting around 9.3 BTC. After public exposure, Procolored’s parent company, Tiansheng, removed the infected files, blaming the breach on USB cross-contamination. Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored has been found distributing malware through its official printer drivers, exposing users to serious cybersecurity risks. The malicious software, which included a remote access trojan and a cryptocurrency stealer, appears to have been embedded in Procolored’s companion software for at least six months. Procolored, based in Shenzhen, China, specializes in digital printing solutions such as DTF, UV, and DTG printers. Since its founding in 2018, the company has expanded rapidly, selling in over 30 countries, including the U.S., where it has a big customer base. Malware Found in Procolored Printer Software, Impacting Users Globally According to local news media , the issue came to light when YouTuber Cameron Coward , known as Serial Hobbyism, detected malware on his system after installing drivers for a $7,000 Procolored UV printer. His antivirus flagged a worm known as Floxif. Coward initially contacted the company, which denied any wrongdoing and claimed the alert was a false positive. “If I try to download the files from their website or unzip the files on the USB drive they gave me, my computer immediately quarantines them,” Coward said. Seeking clarity, Coward turned to Reddit for help . That led to a deeper investigation by Karsten Hahn, a researcher at cybersecurity firm G Data. Hahn confirmed the presence of two pieces of malware: XRedRAT, a remote access trojan capable of keystroke logging and remote control, and SnipVex, a previously unknown clipboard hijacker targeting Bitcoin addresses. The malware was traced to at least six Procolored printer models, with infected files hosted on Mega, linked directly from Procolored’s official support site. A total of 39 compromised files were found. The malware replaced copied Bitcoin wallet addresses with ones controlled by attackers, stealing funds from unsuspecting users. A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 has been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post : “The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program.

The company claimed the infection likely occurred during USB transfers between systems before the files were uploaded online. Users are now urged to scan their systems thoroughly. Experts recommend a full system reinstall for anyone who has used the infected drivers. New, clean driver files are reportedly available but must be requested directly from Tiansheng’s technical support. Chinese Marketplaces and US Fronts Fuel Southeast Asian Fraud Rings The discovery of Bitcoin-stealing malware in Procolored’s official printer drivers comes amid a wider wave of cybercrime infrastructure originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia. On May 18, blockchain firm Elliptic linked a Colorado-incorporated entity to a Chinese-language Telegram marketplace called Xinbi Guarantee, a platform used to facilitate large-scale crypto scams. Source: Elliptic Xinbi has processed over $8.4 billion in stablecoin transactions, primarily USDT, since its inception. The platform offers illicit services ranging from money laundering and fake IDs to tech hardware and stolen personal data. It operates on a “guarantee” model, requiring vendor deposits to maintain trust among criminals. Xinbi was registered in the U.S. in 2022 under the name Xinbi Co. Ltd. The company was flagged as delinquent in early 2025 for failing to file reports. Elliptic suggests the group’s crypto activity may also be tied to North Korean hackers. Xinbi follows Huione Guarantee, another Chinese marketplace exposed in 2024 for facilitating $98 billion in transactions .

During the event, it was revealed that JPMorgan has completed its first public blockchain transaction involving tokenized government bonds. The bank partnered with blockchain companies such as Chainlink and Ondo Finance on this deal. Notably, other big institutions have followed a similar path. Goldman Sachs, which once questioned the future of crypto, is now offering crypto trading services to its clients. It allows wealthy individuals and institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum-related products and invest in blockchain technology and digital asset infrastructure. JPMorgan Chase Meets Crypto Growing Interest In 2025, many investors and companies have shown more interest in cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy recently bought 7,390 Bitcoin, adding to its large Bitcoin holding. The company is currently facing legal questions about its crypto plans. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price remains firm, trading around $105,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. JPMorgan’s new Bitcoin offering fits this more significant trend. It shows that the bank is willing to serve clients who want to invest in digital assets, even as it remains cautious about how it gets involved. CEO Jamie Dimon’s Ongoing Doubts Even with JPMorgan opening doors to Bitcoin, CEO Jamie Dimon has not softened his personal views on the cryptocurrency. In January 2024, he called Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and questioned its value. He said he would never buy Bitcoin himself. Dimon also clarified that he respects people’s choice to buy the coin, even if he does not personally support it. This shows that while the bank responds to customer demand, its leader remains doubtful about Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.

2025-05-19T21:17:08.000Z,"BIP-177 Earthquake in Bitcoin (BTC): If the Vote Passes, Much Will Change – Here’s the Proposal","A new proposal has been making waves in the Bitcoin community: BIP-177. This proposal proposes to redefine the basic unit of Bitcoin, with the smallest unit known as “satoshi” or “sat” in the current system being called “1 Bitcoin.” The Proposal Removes the Concept of Satoshi: 1 BTC Will Be Equal to 100 Million Bitcoins In this case, 1 BTC will be equal to 100 million Bitcoins; that is, 1 sat today will now be considered 1 Bitcoin. The current BTC code will not change. The main idea behind the proposal is to make Bitcoin easier for users to understand and to provide a representation that is more in line with the nature of the Bitcoin protocol. The BIP-177 document published on Github draws attention with the following statements: “This BIP proposes to use the base unit as the standard unit of measurement by eliminating synthetic decimal places. This will make it easier for users to understand Bitcoin, reduce confusion, and directly match the on-chain values on the screen display.” Proponents of the proposal say that the current system’s eight decimal places (e.g. 0.00000001 BTC = 1 satoshi) are confusing, as the Bitcoin blockchain actually stores these values as countable whole units, not decimals. The current system simply prefers decimal representations for user experience. Related News: Surprise Altcoin Sees All-Time High in Number of Active Addresses This Month Twitter (X) founder Jack Dorsey also joined these discussions. Dorsey shared on X by simply writing “BIP-177.” This short but meaningful support attracted attention in the community. If the proposal is accepted, the smallest unit we know today as “1 satoshi” will be called “1 Bitcoin”. The value we currently call “1 Bitcoin” will be equal to 100 million Bitcoins. There will be no change in the technical infrastructure; the only changes will be in the user interface and unit naming. While some Bitcoin users believe that this proposal will help better explain Bitcoin to the public, others argue that it will increase confusion and that changing terms that have been used for years is unnecessary. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T21:00:16.000Z,"Pundit Says XRP Price Will Stabilize At $1,000 And Become ‘Very Expensive’","Despite its current lackluster price action, many crypto analysts have agreed through various analyses over the past few years that XRP has a very bright parabolic rally ahead. This sentiment has particularly gained ground due to its price action in Q4 2024, leading to a multi-year high of $3.34 in January 2025. Although XRP has retraced quite a bit from this high, this hasn’t stopped bold long-term projections from resurfacing. One of the more striking forecasts comes from a crypto analyst who believes the altcoin will not only rally into double digits soon but eventually stabilize at $1,000 and become one of the most expensive digital assets in the world. Analyst Predicts The Altcoin Will Hit $10 To $20 Before Entering New Bear Market Crypto market commentator BarriC shared a post on social media platform X outlining a future price trajectory for XRP that begins with a major surge in the coming months. BarriC’s post begins by criticizing the perception that the current price range, which remains below $3, reflects failure. Instead, he views this phase as an accumulation opportunity before a massive breakout. Related Reading: $10,000 XRP Theory: Factors Analyst Shares Scenarios That Could Drive Growth According to the analyst, there’s a high possibility that the XRP price will climb to somewhere between $10 and $20 in the next few months. Such a move would undoubtedly be accompanied by a surge in the trading volume and activity surrounding XRP. One such primer is if the cryptocurrency somehow gains full utility and adoption with banks in the next few months, or through the launch of a Spot XRP ETF. This surge, BarriC noted, would likely coincide with the final stages of the current altcoin season. Following that, he expects a significant market correction, similar to past cycles, which would bring XRP back down to the $5 to $10 range. Previous cycles dating back to 2016 have typically ended with a sharp 50% market dip. If this happens again, the lower boundary for the next cycle could land between $5 and $10. This mid-cycle dip, according to BarriC, will be the last time XRP is considered cheap before it enters a fundamentally different phase. Banks And Institutional Adoption To Tie Up XRP At $1,000 Permanently BarriC’s prediction is ultimately based on banks’ mass institutional adoption of XRP. He noted that when the asset becomes deeply integrated into the daily operations of banks and financial institutions, we will see a $1,000 XRP. Once trillions of dollars begin flowing consistently through the XRP Ledger, there will be no more volatility and bear market phases for its price. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It’s Headed For $1,000 – Analyst Reveals At that point, BarriC believes the altcoin will stabilize at a $1,000 valuation, not as a temporary peak but as a structural price floor. In this case, future investors may only be able to afford fractions of one XRP, much like Bitcoin currently. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, down by 2.35% in the past 24 hours. XRP has been steadily declining from $2.62 in the past seven days.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience. Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch The annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets. Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentiment Some analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Yields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects. The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings. To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000. USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKX USD Tether ( USDT ) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000. Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demand Bitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow. Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.

However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy.

The price action pattern can be summarized into three different conditions: Range lows and range highs led to immediate trend reversal.

If this pattern holds, it could increase the chances of Bitcoin breaking above $107,000, potentially reaching new highs above $110,000 this week.Conversely, a failure to hold $103,500 could lead to a retest of the $102,000 support. This would be treated as an invalidation of the price fractal, which could open the possibility of new lows under $102,000 in the coming days.

A bearish divergence takes place when the price is forming a higher high, but the relative strength index (RSI) indicator is forming a higher low, meaning that buying pressure is beginning to fade as prices soar.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

2025-05-19T18:00:15.000Z,"‘Before Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar’ — Ledn co-founder","Before discovering Bitcoin (BTC), Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo found success shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar as it rapidly lost value against the stronger US dollar. Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus.

Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts.

This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

Sellers will try to defend the $109,588 resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. Alternatively, a sharp drop below $100,000 signals that the bears have seized control.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
