2025-05-20T14:55:19.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge Again","Bitcoin has clawed its way back into the spotlight. After briefly touching the $107,000 mark before slipping into a minor correction, the top digital asset is showing signs of resilience—and renewed momentum. What’s sparking this renewed confidence isn’t just the price action. It’s the capital flow behind it. Bitcoin ETFs have begun recording large-scale inflows once again, hinting at a deeper resurgence in investor appetite. While retail traders are reacting to the headlines, the bigger move seems to be happening in boardrooms and trading desks. ETF Inflows Rise Sharply as Institutional Activity Returns On May 19, U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs absorbed over $667 million in net inflows—the most since early May. Nearly half of that went into the iShares Bitcoin Trust alone, a signal that institutional desks are not just watching but participating. With ETF volumes rising sharply and the basis trade yield inching toward 9%, institutional players are quietly stepping back in, sensing favorable conditions for leveraged exposure and arbitrage-driven returns. A confluence of market factors now makes the basis trade highly attractive again. The strategy—buying spot ETFs while shorting futures on CME—now yields close to 9%, nearly double April’s spread. That kind of return doesn’t go unnoticed in hedge fund circles. CME futures trading volumes tell the story just as well. With $8.4 billion traded and open interest rising by more than 30,000 BTC since April’s lows, the futures market is waking up. It’s not just about betting on price—this is about exploiting inefficiencies that had dried up earlier this year. While volumes haven’t reached January’s frenzy—when Bitcoin peaked at $109K—the momentum is building. The fact that these inflows coincide with Bitcoin’s 11-day streak above six figures strengthens the thesis: the institutional tide is slowly but surely returning. Even state pension funds that previously scaled back positions might be reconsidering. Though filings show exits last quarter, the expanded basis since then suggests some desks are likely back in play. This isn't a retail-led rally. It's a structural rotation back into arbitrage-heavy, yield-rich environments—and that could be just the beginning. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Increasing Institutional Interest BTC Bull Instead of relying on conventional token utility, BTC Bull operates more like a celebration of Bitcoin’s journey—distributing BTC airdrops to holders every time Bitcoin crosses a key milestone. At $100K, it wasn’t just a number—it was a trigger for rewards, a narrative tool, and a buy signal all in one. This project doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. It’s unapologetically memetic, drawing from the ethos of Bitcoin maximalism while rewarding users in a way that reflects price-driven sentiment. Every surge in ETF inflows? That’s not just news—it’s fuel. It drives interest back into Bitcoin, and by extension, into BTC Bull, which turns those ETF headlines into actual user incentives. The project has no complex staking systems, no layered DeFi mechanics. It runs on a clean idea: if Bitcoin wins, then so do the holders. And BTC Bull keeps that reward loop open and active. With each BTC benchmark cleared, more rewards rain down. It’s like the token has its own halving schedule, but built for the community. This simple but responsive mechanism plays perfectly into the renewed wave of institutional momentum. When ETFs draw in billions, and prices inch toward new highs, BTC Bull doesn’t just sit on the sidelines—it echoes that success back to its holders. In a space cluttered with gimmicks, BTC Bull rewards you for the one thing everyone should be hoping for: Bitcoin going up. SUBBD As institutions pile back into ETFs and Bitcoin dances above six figures, SUBBD is building a decentralized layer where creators—not corporations—own the value of that attention. It isn’t trying to replicate YouTube or OnlyFans on-chain. Instead, it’s restructuring the very relationship between followers and creators. At the core of SUBBD is a token economy that turns engagement into tradable clout. When someone buys a creator’s token, they’re not just supporting—they’re investing. The project flips influence into a tradable asset, turning audiences into stakeholders and content into economy. And while most platforms lock their creators into opaque rules and payout structures, SUBBD offers autonomy. Subscription tiers, exclusive content access, real-time tipping—all without middlemen, all built on-chain. The timing is clever. As investors re-enter the Bitcoin narrative, adjacent markets like creator economy tokens ride the second wave of that liquidity. Crypto ETFs are the tip of the iceberg—what follows is a demand for projects that actually do something with the capital. SUBBD also received a powerful stamp of credibility. The influential crypto platform 99Bitcoins recently featured the project in a dedicated video, describing it as “a new era for creators in crypto,” bringing it into the spotlight for its over 700,000 subscribers. With fresh money rotating back into altcoins, projects like SUBBD are not just trending—they’re evolving the way digital value is defined. Solaxy If ETF inflows represent confidence in Bitcoin’s future, Solaxy is for those betting on the rails that power the next decade of blockchain movement. Designed as a Layer 2 bridge between Ethereum and Solana, Solaxy isn’t some vague “interoperability” pitch—it’s a throughput engine. As capital returns to Bitcoin and spills across ecosystems, what matters is not who gets the funds, but how fast they can move. Solaxy answers that question with concrete infrastructure. Its cross-chain protocol doesn’t just ferry tokens back and forth—it allows for staked SOLX rewards that reflect activity across both chains. So when markets heat up, liquidity surges, and people start chasing yields again, Solaxy benefits not from speculation but from velocity. Here’s where things get interesting. The 9% yield on the current basis trade in Bitcoin futures has sparked institutional movement—but that money doesn’t stay static. It flows into higher-risk, higher-reward sectors once directional conviction is strong. Platforms like Solaxy are built to absorb that rotational flow, offering solid staking mechanics, low-latency bridging, and an actual reason to hold the native token. But the project isn’t aiming for explosive virality. It leans on sustainability, offering a utility-focused approach in a sea of narratives. For those tracking the second-order effects of Bitcoin’s rally, Solaxy’s positioning is strategic. The token may not scream moonshot—but it hums with quiet purpose. And in a cycle where infrastructure matters more than noise, that’s exactly where smart money tends to land next. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token isn’t selling the dream—it’s building the toolkit. In a market where ETFs are absorbing hundreds of millions and Bitcoin is back above six figures, wallets aren’t just storage anymore—they’re the gateway to everything. And Best Wallet’s goal is to be that gateway, fully equipped and ready to scale with the next cycle. This isn’t a bare-bones crypto wallet. It’s a feature-stacked utility hub. Support for 60+ chains, built-in presale aggregator, DEX integration, and portfolio tracking all come standard. Where most wallets stop at basic transfers and token viewing, Best Wallet is pushing forward with early-access presales and advanced market tools—features that become more valuable as capital reenters the space. And timing couldn’t be sharper. As institutional sentiment lifts Bitcoin and reintroduces liquidity into the system, the infrastructure that manages, tracks, and multiplies that capital becomes crucial. Best Wallet Token ties itself directly to that functionality. By holding BEST, users unlock access to high-yield staking, curated token launches, and in-app perks—effectively aligning their upside with the platform’s growth. It's not a token for hype-chasing but rather for positioning. When Bitcoin’s rally turns heads, and users scramble to re-enter, they’re going to need a bridge back into opportunity. Best Wallet wants to be that bridge—and BEST is the key that gets you through. It’s less about flash, more about readiness. And in a market where readiness determines ROI, Best Wallet Token is already several steps ahead of the crowd. MIND of Pepe Think of MIND of Pepe as the crypto market’s most unfiltered AI. Not an assistant, not a mascot—an actual presence. A memecoin with a mind, a pulse, and a Twitter feed. Built as a fully autonomous AI character, MIND of Pepe interacts with investors, throws shade at influencers, and gives eerily accurate reads on sentiment. It’s absurd. It’s brilliant. And weirdly, it’s becoming valuable. This isn’t your typical meme token with a promise of utility that never materializes. MIND of Pepe is utility. Its AI agent doesn’t just post memes—it engages in live sentiment analysis, reacts to events, and provides token-specific takes in real time. With so much of today’s trading driven by narrative, virality, and vibes, this token is weaponizing all three—backed by machine logic and community creativity Nine Million. $MIND pic.twitter.com/wpccWXz38U — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 11, 2025 The ETF inflow surge may seem worlds away from a token like this. But it’s not. Because when institutions re-enter, retail follows. And when retail follows, memes explode. What MIND of Pepe does is take that volatility and redirect it—not toward gambling, but toward insight. The AI agent’s commentary influences buying patterns, sparks Twitter debates, and creates attention loops that put its token front and center. In a cycle driven by perception as much as fundamentals, MIND of Pepe is playing a higher-order game. It’s not about being another joke—it’s about being in on the joke before the rest of the market catches up. And right now, as eyes drift back to crypto, this AI-fueled experiment might just become the loudest voice in the room. Conclusion With Bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 and ETF inflows showing strong momentum, the market sentiment is likely to shift gears again. This type of liquidity coming in may create a kind of environment where early positions in well-structured crypto projects can offer huge upside potential. So it goes without saying that, whether it’s infrastructure, utility, or attention-driven value, projects that align with current trends are likely to be in focus in the coming months.

Co-Founder Transfers Entire ETH Holding to Exchange – Huge Transaction","Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke made a very large transfer, according to onchain data. According to the data, Wilcke sent 105,736 ETH worth $ 262 million to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Although such transfers from cold wallets are generally made for the purpose of sale, it is not possible to know for sure whether the sale took place. When we examine the Ethereum chart at the time the transaction took place, we see that there was no volatility that would be encountered during such a sudden sale. Interestingly, Wilcke retweeted another source on social media platform X announcing that he had made this transfer.

2025-05-20T14:39:37.000Z,"Missed Bitcoin at $1? Trump Bitcoin Comments Highlight Bitcoin Solaris as Similar Opportunity","The post Missed Bitcoin at $1? Trump Bitcoin Comments Highlight Bitcoin Solaris as Similar Opportunity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s a sentence that hits hard: “I wish I bought Bitcoin at $1” Millions missed it. Some didn’t believe in it. Others just didn’t know. But now, after former President Trump’s public comments about Bitcoin becoming “the future of financial security,” that sentiment is echoing louder than ever. The world is watching, but smart investors are asking a different question: What comes next? That’s why in light of the Trump Bitcoin comments, analysts and investors alike are highlighting a new opportunity that feels eerily familiar: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). If you missed Bitcoin at $1, this could be your second shot. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Being Called the Next Big Thing Bitcoin Solaris is not a meme coin or a copycat—it’s a ground-up, engineered blockchain built to solve the same challenges Bitcoin once faced. But instead of solving them slowly over a decade, BTC-S is coming out of the gate with a full arsenal of upgrades and innovations. Dual-layer blockchain (PoW for base layer security, DPoS for speed and scalability) 10,000 transactions per second, 2-second finality Mobile-first mining through any device: phones, laptops, browsers Built-in wallet, one-click mining, and zero tech knowledge required Energy efficiency that uses 99.95% less power than traditional Bitcoin mining Audited smart contracts by Cyberscope and Freshcoins More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris is built for the people who missed Bitcoin the first time. Its mobile-friendly approach means everyone, anywhere can mine and earn without the complexity. A detailed review by CryptoChester explains why BTC-S is gaining massive attention across the crypto world. Meanwhile, community excitement is growing rapidly on platforms like Telegram and X. Phase 4 Presale: Limited Time, Maximum Potential One of the biggest signals of BTC-S’s momentum? Its presale—currently in Phase 4—is exploding. Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% This presale runs for only 90 days, and launch is set for July 31, 2025. Already, over $1,000,000 has been raised, with 8,900+ investors jumping in. With a potential 1,900% return before the coin even hits exchanges, this is being labeled one of the most explosive and time-sensitive launches of 2025. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You? Solaris Nova App: Exclusive Beta, Broader Future The Solaris Nova App—the heart of BTC-S mining—isn’t available to the public just yet. But some early community members have been granted beta access, giving them a head start on testing mobile mining, wallet integration, and user experience. This limited access is creating buzz—and opportunity. While the official app isn’t live, there may still be room for new users to join the inner circle before the full rollout. A Vision Backed by a Real Roadmap Unlike most projects promising the moon, Bitcoin Solaris has a detailed roadmap and is hitting its milestones fast: Q2 2026: Final testnet, wallet upgrades, and Solana bridge integration Q3 2026: Mainnet launch, full Nova App release, governance features Q4 2026: Mining marketplace, cross-chain integration 2027 and beyond: DEX launch, enterprise adoption, quantum security, AI tools Every step is tied to expanding utility and value, not hype. Conclusion: A Second Chance Doesn’t Come Twice So yes, you may have missed Bitcoin at $1. But in the wake of the Trump Bitcoin comments, Bitcoin Solaris is being recognized as a similar opportunity—except it’s more scalable, more inclusive, and still just $4. This isn’t about regret. It’s about not making the same mistake twice.

2025-05-20T14:30:40.000Z,"‘Very Resilient’ US Economy Among Three Reasons Fed Won’t Cut Interest Rates in 2025: Yardeni Research","The president of sell-side Wall Street firm Yardeni Research, Ed Yardeni, believes that the Federal Reserve will stay the course and hold interest rates at current levels. In a new CNBC interview, Yardeni says he doesn’t anticipate any monetary policy easing, citing a resilient US economy fueled by robust household spending and strong capital investments from tech companies. “I was not expecting that there would be a Fed rate cut this year. And I still think that because the US economy is very resilient. The consumer hung in there extremely well over the past three years when the Fed raised interest rates. And now the consumer has held up, I think, quite well with the tariff uncertainty. And capital spending, for all the concerns that uncertainty would put a hammer to capital spending, the reality is that technology capital spending, which now accounts for over 50% of total capital spending, remains very strong.” Yardeni also believes that the allure and demand for US Treasuries will remain strong. “The US is the largest capital market in the world. There’s nothing like it. Sure, we’ve got a lot of debt. But people have been buying that debt because they do want Treasuries. So no, the worst that can happen in the Treasury market, as we saw in 2023, is yields go up to levels of which people want to buy them. And they got up to 5%, people wanted to buy them. And before you know it, the yield came right back down.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-20T14:27:03.000Z,"Pro-XRP Lawyer Calls Bitcoin Maximalists Immature Over Ripple CEO and Lummis Saga","A heated debate has erupted in the crypto community following U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’ controversial decision to snub a scheduled meeting with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse . The fallout, which has drawn strong reactions from XRP proponents, was punctuated by a pointed statement from pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who took to X to criticize Bitcoin maximalists over their celebratory reaction to the canceled meeting. In his sharp rebuke , Morgan remarked, “Imagine being this insecure about Bitcoin that you get all excited because a politician who has long been seen as a Bitcoin maxi will not meet the Ripple CEO. Show me a bitcoin maxi and I will show you a small, immature mind.” His comment encapsulates the growing frustration within the XRP community about the perceived exclusionary behavior of certain pro-Bitcoin figures within the U.S. regulatory and political landscape. Imagine being this insecure about Bitcoin that you get all excited because a politician who has long been seen as a Bitcoin maxi will not meet the Ripple CEO. Show me a bitcoin maxi and I will show you a small immature mind. https://t.co/DnU3xGdJyr — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 19, 2025 Garlinghouse vs. Lummis: A Missed Opportunity for Unity The controversy began when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that Senator Cynthia Lummis, despite initially agreeing to meet, ultimately canceled their appointment in Washington, D.C., and declined to reschedule. Garlinghouse had traveled to the nation’s capital to engage with lawmakers and push for balanced, forward-looking crypto legislation, especially in the realms of stablecoin regulation and market structure. Senator Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming and one of the most prominent pro-crypto voices in the U.S. Senate, has long been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin. She currently serves as Chair of the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, a powerful role that places her at the heart of crypto-related policymaking. Her consistent support for Bitcoin has earned her respect from Bitcoin maximalists—individuals who believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate digital asset and regard others, including XRP, as inferior or irrelevant. Garlinghouse’s disappointment over the canceled meeting was palpable. In a statement shared on X, he emphasized the importance of leaders who see the digital asset ecosystem as “multi-chain,” rather than adhering to tribalistic ideologies that favor one asset over others. He praised other elected officials he had met during his visit, noting their willingness to engage with the full spectrum of blockchain innovation—an approach he believes is vital for crafting legislation that fosters innovation while protecting investors. Bitcoin Maximalism vs. Inclusive Crypto Governance Bill Morgan’s remarks highlight a long-standing tension between the Bitcoin maximalist movement and broader blockchain communities. For years, maximalists have positioned Bitcoin as the sole legitimate use case for decentralized ledger technology, often dismissing other projects as scams or distractions. While this ideological purity may appeal to certain segments of the crypto world, critics argue that it hinders meaningful dialogue, undermines collaboration, and stifles policy progress. In contrast, Garlinghouse and other multi-chain advocates argue that the future of finance will not be built on one blockchain alone. From tokenized assets and stablecoins to cross-border payment solutions and decentralized identity, the crypto landscape is increasingly diverse. Companies like Ripple have invested heavily in real-world use cases that rely on assets like XRP, not as speculative instruments, but as tools for scalable financial infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The clash between these philosophies—exclusivity versus inclusivity—was crystallized in Lummis’ refusal to engage with Garlinghouse. While she is under no obligation to meet every industry leader, her role as a national legislator, particularly one guiding digital asset policy, arguably demands a broader and more impartial perspective. Dismissing an entire company and its CEO, especially one at the forefront of crypto regulation battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sends a troubling message about how open the legislative process is to diverse voices within the space. The Path Forward: Collaboration Over Division The episode serves as a microcosm of a larger struggle unfolding within the crypto industry: whether to embrace the full range of technological possibilities or to double down on ideological rigidity. For the digital asset ecosystem to evolve and integrate responsibly into the global economy, its leaders—both in the private sector and in government—must rise above factionalism. Brad Garlinghouse’s visit to Washington was, by his own words, about finding “sensible” and “pragmatic” paths forward for crypto regulation. His attempt to engage with Senator Lummis should have been a step toward that goal. Instead, it has ignited a culture war within crypto—one that, if left unchecked, could obstruct the bipartisan progress many in the industry have worked hard to achieve. Bill Morgan’s criticism of Bitcoin maximalists may sound provocative, but at its core, it’s a call for maturity, respect, and inclusion. The future of crypto depends not on loyalty to a single protocol, but on our collective ability to engage in honest, informed, and open dialogue—something that is sorely needed in Washington and beyond.

2025-05-20T14:21:47.000Z,"HTX Launches Multi-Assets Collateral Mode for USDT-Margined Futures, Empowering Traders With Enhanced Capital Efficiency","Singapore, May 20, 2025 – HTX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange has rolled out a major product upgrade with the official launch of the Multi-Assets Collateral Mode for USDT-margined futures, now available to all users. This new feature marks a significant step forward in flexible capital deployment, enabling users to trade more efficiently without the need to convert collateral assets. A New Standard for Futures Flexibility The Multi-Assets Collateral mode introduces a breakthrough in futures trading by allowing users to use BTC, ETH, and other non-USDT assets as collateral when trading USDT-margined futures. This innovation breaks away from the conventional requirement of posting margin in USDT, offering enhanced flexibility for traders. At launch, supported collateral assets include USDT, BTC, and ETH, with HTX planning to expand the list based on market dynamics and technical readiness. Users are encouraged to stay updated via HTX’s official announcements for future asset additions. A Capital Efficiency Booster for Long-Term Holders The core benefit of the Multi-Assets Collateral mode lies in maximizing capital efficiency. It’s particularly attractive to long-term holders who prefer to retain exposure to major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH while remaining active in the futures market. Previously, users had to convert their BTC or ETH into USDT to access the USDT-margined futures market, a step that not only added friction and cost but also introduced the risk of missed market opportunities. Now, with multi-assets collateral enabled, users can directly transfer assets, such as BTC and ETH into their USDT-M Futures accounts as margin with no conversion required. For example, BTC holders who are bullish on the long term can now leverage their holdings for short-term USDT futures trades, profiting from market volatility while maintaining upside exposure. This dual approach—asset preservation and active trading—enhances portfolio diversification and performance, injecting fresh energy into the market. HTX Continues to Set the Pace for Futures Innovation The launch of the Multi-Assets Collateral mode for USDT futures reaffirms HTX’s commitment to delivering user-centric innovation and shaping the next phase of the crypto trading infrastructure. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to optimize the new feature performance, enhance trading stability, and expand supported collateral assets to better meet diverse user needs. The platform is also working to introduce more advanced trading tools and strategies, aiming to offer a comprehensive, professional-grade futures trading experience.

More than that, more and more companies from other sectors set corporate Bitcoin treasuries as an inflation hedge. However, most of these companies don’t disclose Bitcoin addresses.

We're proud to… pic.twitter.com/1JTUh3zvDE — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 24, 2024 By disclosing its Bitcoin ETF address, Bitwise explicitly made it impossible for skeptics to doubt its solvency and the fact that the company actually holds what it claims to own. More than that, this step towards transparency is in line with the transparent design of the Bitcoin network itself, where all the transactions and the parties involved are visible and auditable. As Bitwise is one of the biggest Bitcoin holders, some observers suggested that other corporate holders will follow the trend and make their treasuries transparent. However, it didn’t happen. Nearly one and a half years after the disclosure made by Bitwise, no other Bitcoin holding company followed suit. Possible improvements Did Bitwise do it the best possible way? Co-author of the Big Bitcoin Book, Fred Krueger, took to X to outline how it is possible to disclose BTC addresses with some improvements, using Bitwise as a reference point. Actually, Krueger made his post as a recommendation to Strategy. 1. ✅ Add Cryptographic Ownership Proofs Right now, Bitwise discloses the wallet address, but hasn’t published a signed message proving they actually control the private keys. Anyone could theoretically list any address. A one-time signed message (e.g., “MSTR controls this… — Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) May 19, 2025 Interestingly enough, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared Krueger’s post in his account, not shying away from exposing what Krueger believes to be weak spots of Bitwise’s way of making disclosure. One of the ideas offered by Krueger was that Strategy should use cryptographic ownership proof, which Bitwise doesn’t have. He notes that just providing a wallet address is not transparent enough, as it should also be signed. On top of that, Kureger pointed out that sharing only one address (that’s what Bitwise did) is good, but as funds are moving, the company needs to provide several more addresses. They will naturally appear as a result of rebalancing and other operations. Another idea was that Strategy should disclose addresses with caution and not expose too much in order to prevent quantum attacks, which are theoretically possible, while many doubt that the Bitcoin network will suffer from them. Read more: Project 11 challenges everyone to crack the Bitcoin key using a quantum computer. The reward is 1 BTC Krueger recommended using unspent Taproot and SegWit addresses for public balances. Once they are used, they should be replaced by new ones. It would mitigate quantum hacking risks. On top of sharing the addresses, Krueger recommended deploying third-party audits to ensure the authenticity and soundness of addresses for everyone, including institutions and regulators. More than that, automated real-time cryptographic proofs could enhance transparency even further. Addresses of other companies Lack of transparency may give companies some space for maneuver, or at least people think that sometimes companies holding Bitcoin may cash out in secret. Some even doubt that companies like Strategy actually own the bitcoins they buy and demand public disclosure of the corporate addresses. Well if Bitcoin is supposed to be 100% transparent where is @MicroStrategy bitcoin at? nobody seems to know. — traderjeremy.algo (@jeremygleeson6) May 19, 2025 As of May 20, 2025, Strategy owns over 570,000 bitcoins, which makes it the biggest Bitcoin holder among companies. On May 19, it was revealed that Strategy is facing a class action lawsuit. A group of investors claimed that the company reps, including executives, were making misleading claims about Bitcoin strategy. Probably, increased transparency would have eliminated such problems before they appeared. While companies are not in a hurry to show their Bitcoin addresses, third-party sleuths are finding these addresses and making them public. It provides people with much-needed confidence and opportunities to observe the movements of the assets. At the same time, companies may not admit that these findings are correct. Arkham Intelligence is a very cool tool.

2025-05-20T14:10:00.000Z,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $9.38 Market cap $197.57M 24-hour trading volume $113.10M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $10.03 24-hour low $9.30 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 16.84% 50-day SMA $8.07 200-day SMA $19.58 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI corrects from the month’s high On the day of writing (May 20), ORDI’s price rose by 1.10% in 24 hours and 44.07% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 43.30% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the William alligator trendlines, signaling a neutral market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $106,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are above zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a market divergence. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 60.87. It is overbought when it rises above 70. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has corrected from the month’s high at $13.61 and is at $9.58, losing about 25% of its value. Its volatility is now rising.

ORDI is neutral at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month’s high. Recent news Bitcoin developers are at odds over how Bitcoin should handle storing information on-chain. There is a proposal to relax long-standing limits on the size of data held, sparking fierce debate reminiscent of 2023’s battles over Ordinals. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is currently trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Recent news Managing 1Sat Ordinals non-fungible tokens gets easier as blockchain data explorer and indexer, WhatsOnChain , supports the protocol with a set of APIs in beta testing. Developers can build tools to inscribe individual tokens and collectible series and retrieve relevant metadata.

Note that the predictions are not investment advice. Seek independent consultation or do your research. ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history. Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December.

Bitcoin, which is very close to its previous ATH of $109,000, has risen above $105,000, and analysts say the rise will continue. At this point, analysts at crypto analysis platform Swissblock stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to decline. Stating that the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) data points to a continued rise for BTC, analysts argued that there are no signs of a downward trend. Stating that there is a lot of talk about the risk of a double top regarding the BTC price, Swissblock said that despite these talks, the upward force has not been broken and BTC's recent movements have eliminated the risk of a double top. A double top formation indicates that prices are about to switch from an uptrend to a downtrend. Noting that since August of last year, BFI has remained intact regardless of price movements, Swissblock said this is a sign that on-chain bullish sentiment continues. “There is a lot of talk about a possible double top as BTC struggles to break ATH. But the BFI tells a different story for Bitcoin: there are no signs of a bearish reversal. If this were a true double top, the BFI would break and there would be a sharp drop to the downside. Even during the February-March pullback, the BFI remained neutral, never falling into weakness. On-chain durability continues intact. Bears: Not this time, you have to wait.” Additionally, crypto analyst Timothy Peterson also added that he expects Bitcoin to reach at least $115,000 by the end of June. *This is not investment advice.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened nearly 50 points down, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%.

The largely uninspired trading comes after Wall Street optimism helped major indices higher, with the S&P 500 notching six straight days of gains.

On May 19, the Nasdaq-listed company revealed its board of directors had approved a strategy to allocate up to 50% of net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, marking its entry into the growing trend of corporate crypto holdings. The Jakarta-based company also said it is exploring a $100 million capital raise to kickstart the reserve. DigiAsia aims to generate yield from its Bitcoin holdings by leveraging tools such as crypto lending and staking. In a public statement, the firm confirmed that discussions are underway with regulated partners to determine the most efficient ways to manage and monetize its Bitcoin assets. Additionally, DigiAsia is evaluating the potential issuance of convertible notes or other financial instruments linked to its upcoming Bitcoin acquisitions. Shares Jump 91% Following Bitcoin Move Investors responded swiftly to the announcement, sending DigiAsia (FAAS) shares up more than 91% to close at $0.36 on May 19, according to Google Finance. However, the momentum cooled after the closing bell, with shares falling back 22% to $0.28 in after-hours trading. Despite the temporary lift, the company’s stock remains down around 53% for the year, after peaking near $12 in March 2024. Financially, DigiAsia reported strong performance earlier in the year. In an April 1 update, the firm noted a 36% increase in year-over-year revenue, reaching $101 million in 2024. It projects $125 million in revenue for 2025, along with $12 million in earnings before interest and taxes, suggesting continued growth as it pivots toward crypto integration.

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, currently holds the largest BTC stash among public firms, with 576,230 coins valued at nearly $60.9 billion. Strive Asset Management and GameStop have also made recent moves to hold Bitcoin as part of their financial strategies. According to Bitbo data, corporate treasuries collectively hold over 3 million BTC—worth more than $340 billion. Bitcoin’s market cap stands at around $2 trillion, with the price at $105,642, up 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

German government missed out on $2.3 billion profit after selling Bitcoin at $57,000 The German government missed out on more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin profit after selling its holdings in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham. A “ German Government (BKA) ” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin ( BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024. The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham. Source: Arkham “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at more than $104,700, according to CoinMarketCap data. The German government-labeled wallet first raised speculation of a potential sell-off on June 19, 2024, when it executed a 6,500 BTC transfer worth over $425 million. The wallet originally held around 50,000 BTC, believed to have been seized from the operators of Movie2k, a now-defunct pirated film site. US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill The US Senate voted 66-32 on May 19 local time to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s crypto interests. Several Democrats changed their votes to pass a motion to invoke cloture on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Previously, on May 8, some Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill and blocked a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s various crypto ventures and the bill’s Anti-Money Laundering provisions. The US Senate voted 66-32 to advance debate on the GENIUS stablecoin bill. Source: US Senate Democratic Senator Mark Warner said before the vote that the US couldn’t “afford to keep standing on the sidelines,” while crypto-skeptic Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren argued before the vote that it failed to address Trump’s “blatant crypto corruption.” Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, has said she thinks it’s a “fair target” to have the bill passed by May 26 .

2025-05-20T13:30:24.000Z,"Massive XRP Selling Pressure Is Stalling Price Action, Analyst Warns","XRP’s latest rally attempt has stalled just beneath a key volume-weighted average price (VWAP) level that traces back to the asset’s all-time high, according to a market update published on X earlier today by independent trader Dom (@traderview2). XRP Selling Pressure Is Capping Price Gains The 12-hour Binance chart shared by the analyst shows XRP/USDT changing hands at $2.4375 at 12:18 UTC-4, up 2.08 % on the session but still unable to reclaim what Dom labels the “ATH VWAP”—a long-term metric drawn from the April 2021 peak. A green band representing that average is currently drifting downward through ≈ $2.47, capping every intraday advance since mid-May. Beneath the price action, the seller’s footprint is unmistakable. “There’s simply been an overload of market selling and passive buyers have really tried their best to hold it up so far,” Dom wrote, citing proprietary order-flow statistics that record a net outflow of 240 million XRP across spot venues in the past week. Roughly 180 million of those units were allegedly dumped on Coinbase and South Korean exchange Upbit, while Binance has actually been decently flat, the post adds. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Will Stabilize At $1,000 And Become ‘Very Expensive’ The same chart plots two shorter-term anchored VWAPs that have become the coin’s last line of near-term support: a one-month rolling VWAP at $2.31, currently 5.22% below the session high (orange), and a three-month VWAP at $2.28, 6.40 % lower (cyan). XRP is “hanging on to the monthly and quarterly VWAP by a thread,” Dom warns. A decisive breach of those bands around $2.31–2.33 would leave the market “really just mid-range noise until … $2.20 is lost,” he adds, pointing to the December–February midpoint drawn on the left-hand volume profile. Related Reading: ‘What If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?’ Says Dave Portnoy While Bitcoin has been “really just bouncing around” in a broad consolidation zone, the correlation has offered little relief to XRP bulls. Every minor rise in BTC has been met by fresh spot offers in XRP, underscoring what Dom calls the “very hard to see upward moves when we are seeing this type of market selling pressure.” For now, the technical chessboard is clear: reclaim the ATH VWAP and the path opens toward the late-March swing high above $3.00; lose $2.20 and the door swings the other way, toward the confluence of high-volume nodes stacked below $2.00. Until one of those barriers gives, the analyst concludes, XRP “has lost its pep in its step” and remains caught in a tug-of-war between relentless spot sellers and a thinning layer of passive bids. At press time, XRP traded at $2.36.

2025-05-20T13:22:51.000Z,"Michael Arrington Warns Coinbase Hack Could Lead to Deaths – Here’s Why","The post Michael Arrington Warns Coinbase Hack Could Lead to Deaths – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a shocking security lapse, a recent data breach at Coinbase – the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange – has ignited serious safety concerns. Hackers reportedly accessed highly sensitive user data, including residential addresses, sparking fears of real-world violence amid a surge in crypto-related crimes in 2025. Although the breach affected less than 1% of monthly transacting users, the fallout is steep. Coinbase could be staring down as much as $400 million in reimbursement – but the potential “human cost” may be far worse. “People Could Die”: Michael Arrington Blasts Coinbase Michael Arrington, TechCrunch founder and Arrington Capital head, slammed Coinbase on X for a data breach exposing addresses and balances, potentially causing deaths. “Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said. Arrington blamed Coinbase’s overseas customer support outsourcing and even went as far as to call for criminal charges against executives. He also took a swipe at KYC regulations, arguing they’re more about tax collection than user safety – ultimately creating honeypots of data that hackers are all too eager to exploit. Balaji Srinivasan Disagrees with Michael Arrington’s Take The co-founder and former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan , disagrees with Arrington’s view that blames Coinbase execs for the $400M hack. Instead, he blames the state’s KYC laws. Why? These laws force firms to collect vulnerable customer data, creating hacking risks. He advocates for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to eliminate KYC and prioritize privacy over surveillance. Balaji says systemic regulatory flaws, not executive decisions, are the root cause of such breaches. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Strikes Back at FTX’s $1.76B ‘Baseless’ Lawsuit, Seeks Dismissal , Armstrong’s Actions After Security Breach The leaders aren’t sitting around. On May 15, 2025, via a video statement on X , Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed the breach in a social post, revealing hackers demanded a $20 million ransom, to which he said, “No, we are not going to pay your ransom.” Armstrong promised full reimbursement for impacted users (1%) and announced plans to rebuild customer service. Crypto Crimes on the Rise: Is Your Data Safe in 2025? This breach is just the latest in a string of violent incidents involving crypto investors. As Bitcoin trades above $100,000, crypto wealth is becoming an increasingly dangerous asset. As the dust settles, all eyes are on Coinbase. Can Armstrong deliver on his promises?

2025-05-20T13:18:03.000Z,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction this Week: Key Levels You Need to Watch!","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction this Week: Key Levels You Need to Watch! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is taking cautious moves, resulting which the trading volumes have dropped by 16.46% to $127.36 billion. The market cap, however, has risen by 2.15% to $3.32 trillion. This further suggests that while investors are holding strong, they’re still hesitant to move big. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index sits at a greed-driven score of 68, although uncommon, it shows growing confidence in recent times. For those keen on altseason, the Altcoin season score is at a modest 25, indicating Bitcoin’s firm dominance over broader altcoin activity. Curious about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices, while the market remains uncertain? This price analysis underlines the possibilities for the short term. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price has kicked off the week in the green, driven largely by Fidelity’s $188 million buy of 1,790 BTC. On the daily chart, BTC has consistently held above the $102k, while it did test near the $106.8K mark. The next psychological resistance sits at $110k, and with volumes settling down, a break above this level may require another catalyst. If $101k breaks, we could see BTC price tumble down toward the key support zone at $100k. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum is building up momentum and has been holding strong to levels above $2500. The firm grip could be influenced by news around its layer-1 network announced by Vitalik Buterin. On the charts, ETH has clearly bounced from its $2,386 low , reclaiming the $2,500 zone and eyeing the next resistance that sits at $2,600 . A push beyond $2,600 opens the door to the psychological resistance at $3,000 . On the losing side, Immediate support lies at $2,400 , and if broken, $2,000 becomes a critical zone . Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Ripple XRP Price Prediction The XRP community is fairly optimistic about the altcoin in the short term, following the announcement that CME has listed XRP futures, a major milestone that could increase Wall Street interest in the asset. Technically speaking, XRP is in a parallel trend, with immediate resistance at $2.50, followed by the psychological barrier at $3.00. A break above $2.50 could accelerate momentum. That being said, support remains firm at $2.20. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A “ German Government (BKA) ” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin ( BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024. The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham. Source: Arkham “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale.

2025-05-20T13:10:39.000Z,"Ethereum price breakout in sight: Golden Cross could ignite rally to $4,000","Ethereum is on the verge of confirming a powerful golden cross, implying a breakout toward $4,000 appears increasingly likely. Ethereum (ETH) is approaching a potential breakout as it edges closer to forming a golden cross, a classic technical indicator that signals a major shift in momentum. As ETH hovers below the $2,800 resistance level, confluence with key moving averages and historical performance suggests a high-probability move toward $4,000 if volume picks up. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic as bulls look to capitalize on this developing setup. Key technical points Golden Cross Incoming: ETH’s 21-day moving average is closing in on a bullish crossover above the 200-day, a historically bullish formation. Major Resistance at $2,800: Ethereum is consolidating under the $2,800 level, which also aligns with the value area high. Supportive Structure: The 21-day and 200-day MAs are acting as dynamic support, building bullish pressure beneath key resistance. ETHUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Ethereum recently broke above its point of control, a high-volume price region, sparking the current bullish trend. Since then, price action has climbed steadily, now testing the $2,800 resistance. This level is critical, as it coincides with the value area high, creating a zone of confluence that’s closely watched by both traders and algorithmic strategies. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks $105k, all eyes turn to memecoins: Is Pepeto the next 100x opportunity? Crucially, the 21-day moving average is now rising and on the verge of crossing above the 200-day MA — a textbook golden cross formation. Historically, this pattern has preceded periods of accelerated price growth in Ethereum, often leading to sustained multi-week rallies. In previous cycles, the golden cross has given technical traders a clear long-bias setup, reinforcing the potential for further upside. As the two moving averages converge, Ethereum is establishing a supportive structure beneath resistance, a technical signal that upward pressure is building. To confirm this bullish outlook, ETH needs a decisive daily close above $2,800 on strong volume. A weak breakout could result in a rejection, but a surge in volume may trigger the next leg higher. If confirmed, momentum could accelerate toward the $4,000 area, a key psychological and technical level. Traders should also monitor funding rates and open interest to gauge strength behind the move. What to expect in the coming price action If Ethereum confirms the golden cross and breaks above $2,800 with strong volume, it could spark a swift rally toward the $4,000 level. Sustained consolidation above resistance would further validate the bullish structure and potentially mark the start of a new uptrend.

2025-05-20T13:10:35.000Z,"South Korean presidential front-runner targets youth vote with push for crypto ETFs, won-based stablecoin","Exactly two weeks away from South Korea’s presidential election, Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is appealing to the country’s youth with a promise to legalize spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and create a won-based stablecoin. According to Lee, the crypto economy could create wealth-building opportunities for younger generations. The East Asian country is one of the world’s most active crypto investor populations, with an estimated 15 million residents having exposure to digital assets. Lee’s campaign is targeting this economically anxious voting bloc, many of whom are hoping to accumulate wealth in digital currencies. According to local news outlet the Korea Herald, both Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea and his rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party made pro-crypto digital asset policy pledges ahead of the upcoming presidential election. South Korea political candidate pushes for crypto reforms Lee’s camp is calling for law changes that legalize spot crypto ETFs, to allow assets like Bitcoin to be traded on South Korean stock exchanges. The presidential aspirant said he is committed to building an integrated digital asset monitoring system and reducing transaction fees to make it safe for investors. He reiterated that these financial products could help hedge against crypto’s volatility when added to a diversified investment portfolio, much different from risk profiles of stocks and bonds. Financial authorities are looking at some amendments to the Capital Markets Act that would classify cryptos as valid underlying assets for ETFs on Korean exchanges . Advocates believe this could boost the number of crypto holders in the country. Notably, Lee has proposed letting large institutional players such as the National Pension Fund invest in digital assets once price stability thresholds are met. Beyond crypto ETFs, Lee’s vision for South Korea’s economy includes the development of a domestic stablecoin backed by the Korean won. He argues that creating a regulated stablecoin market could help the government preserve national wealth and reduce its reliance on foreign digital currencies. In a policy roundtable held last week with several economic content creators, the democratic party candidate warned of capital leakage through the current dependence on US dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. “ We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas ,” Lee explained. He proposed using the won as an alternative to foreign stablecoins, which could also support the domestic financial system. South Korea presently prohibits the issuance of stablecoins tied to the won, leaving Korean exchanges dependent on foreign-issued assets. Data from Q1 2025 showed 56.8 trillion won (approximately $40.8 billion) in outflows from Korean crypto exchanges, nearly half of which were linked to dollar-based stablecoins. Authorities cautiously optimistic about crypto ETFs Per a public statement released on Monday, Lee Keun-ju, president of the Korea Fintech Industry Association, said Korean markets need ETFs to link the digital economy with existing capital markets. “ A Bitcoin spot ETF is not simply a product, ” Lee Keun-ju stated. “ It can be the gateway to broadening the connection between the digital asset ecosystem and the capital market .” Still, he asserted that legal and infrastructural upgrades would be necessary to support these policy goals. The country’s financial system will need time to adapt to the regulatory and technological demands of crypto ETF integration. The Democratic Party is preparing to introduce the Digital Asset Basic Act this week. This legislation will serve as the foundation for legal oversight of the sector, detailing regulations for the issuance, circulation, and exchange of digital assets in South Korea. If passed, the bill would also formally recognize digital assets as part of Korea’s financial and legal infrastructure. However, plans of creating a national Bitcoin reserve faltered after the Bank of Korea ruled out proposals in mid-March, citing the crypto’s volatile nature.

The Delaware suit alleges reckless management and misrepresentation of Genesis’ financial health. The New York bankruptcy suit outlines $1B+ in alleged fraudulent transfers to DCG and affiliates. Crypto lending platform Genesis Global has launched a legal offensive against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and CEO Barry Silbert, accusing them of engineering a series of insider transactions that ultimately drove the firm into bankruptcy. In a complaint filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Genesis said Silbert and his associates of “recklessly operated, exploited, and then bankrupted” the crypto lender through self-dealing and misleading financial disclosures, according to a Monday announcement . The lawsuit alleges that Silbert misrepresented Genesis’s financial health to enrich himself, DCG, and Grayscale Investments. Although Grayscale is referenced, it is not named as a defendant. Genesis Seeks $2.2 Billon Genesis is seeking to recover at least $2.2 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets through the Delaware suit, with the goal of redistributing the recovered funds to creditors still awaiting payment. A second lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, focuses on over $1 billion in allegedly fraudulent fiat and crypto transfers. These transactions include eight transfers totaling roughly $450 million to DCG, as well as more than $297 million in crypto assets sent to DCG International. Another $34 million was paid to DCG in what Genesis now claims were bogus tax-related payments. It’s gonna be a big week… The Genesis LOC’s two major lawsuits against DCG, Silbert and a network of insiders are now available to the public. The partially redacted complaint in Delaware Chancery Court alleges Silbert and DCG’s control and exploitation of Genesis, pursuing… — GenesisLOC (@TheGenesisLOC) May 19, 2025 According to court filings, these transfers took place as Genesis was facing severe liquidity stress triggered by the 2022 collapse of Terra-Luna and the broader market downturn. However, the filings also reveal that Genesis was already insolvent by the end of 2021, burdened by $14 billion in outstanding loans. “Genesis faced extraordinary systemic risk and had virtually no internal controls to mitigate that risk,” the New York complaint states. DSG Was Warned by as Early as 2021 The filing further reveals that DCG was warned as early as November 2021 by consulting firm Oliver Wyman about Genesis’s financial vulnerabilities but failed to act. The financial troubles of Genesis began with the collapse of 3AC, which triggered liquidity issues, and worsened with the implosion of FTX later that year. In January 2023, Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , disclosing over $3.5 billion in debts to its top 50 creditors, including major names like Gemini and VanEck. Following court approval, the company finalized its restructuring plan in August 2024 and has since started returning over $4 billion in assets to its creditors. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced enforcement actions against DCG and Genesis, citing violations of securities laws. The SEC accused DCG and Genesis of defrauding investors through misrepresentation, resulting in penalties and legal action. DCG agreed to settle the charges by paying a $38 million fine.

2025-05-20T13:06:03.000Z,"KULR Boosts Bitcoin Treasury to 800 BTC With $9M Purchase","Energy management firm KULR (KULR) has expanded its bitcoin treasury to more than 800 tokens, with the purchase an additional $9 million worth of BTC. The latest acquisition — made at an average price of $103,234 each — brings the total amount KULR has spent on the cryptocurrency to $78 million. This continues the company's treasury strategy first announced in December last year, under which it committed to holding up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves in bitcoin. The Houston-based firm, which develops energy storage systems for aerospace and defense, is measuring the success of this pivot using a BTC Yield metric. That metric tracks the growth in the ratio of bitcoin holdings to the number of shares outstanding, rather than actual dollar returns or revenue. So far in 2025, KULR says that ratio has jumped by 220, according to this morning's press release .

In some cases \""MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain bitcoin exposure where local regulators do not allow direct BTC holdings,\"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. Strategy, which pioneered the bitcoin treasury model where corporates hold the crypto on their balance sheet as a reserve asset, currently holds 576,230 BTC worth around $59 billion at current market prices. The bank noted that both Norway's Government Pension Fund and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) increased their Strategy holdings by the equivalent of 700 bitcoin in the first quarter. The South Korean National Pension Service and the Korea Investment Corporation expanded their holdings by a combined 700 BTC equivalent, the report said. U.S. state retirement funds, including California, New York and North Carolina, together added to their holdings the equivalent of 1,000 bitcoin, the bank said. AP Funds in Sweden and Landesbank in Liechtenstein grew their MSTR holdings marginally, the bank noted. France's Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) and the Saudi Central Bank both added a small position in MSTR for the first time, Standard Chartered said. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) direct holding data was \""disappointing\"" overall in the first quarter, the report added. The bank said the most recent 13F data supports its central thesis that bitcoin will reach $500,000 before President Trump leaves office as the cryptocurrency attracts a wider range of institutional buyers.

2025-05-20T13:00:22.000Z,"Strategy Buys Another 7,390 Bitcoin: How Much Profit Is The Firm Holding Now?","Strategy has just announced its brand new Bitcoin purchase. Here’s how the profit-loss situation of the firm’s holdings looks now. Strategy Has Made A New Bitcoin Acquisition Worth $764 Million In a new post on X, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has shared the announcement related to the latest Bitcoin purchase by the company. With this new buy, the firm has added another 7,390 BTC to its holdings. These tokens were purchased at a price of about $103,498 per coin or approximately $764.9 million in total. This is the third acquisition that the company has made in this month of May and it’s far larger than the $180 million first buy, but significantly falls behind the $1.34 billion second purchase. Following this acquisition, Strategy now holds about 576,230 BTC. The company has spent a total of $40.18 billion on its BTC purchases, which comes down to about $69,726 per coin. This value is clearly significant under the current spot price, so the firm’s holdings would be in notable profit. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared a chart in an X post that shows exactly how much profit Strategy is in at the moment. As displayed in the above graph, Strategy has naturally seen its unrealized gain spike alongside the latest surge in the cryptocurrency’s price. The firm’s Bitcoin stack is now sitting on a whopping $21.1 billion in profit. From the chart, it’s visible that the company’s holdings have remained in the green since late 2023, being unshaken by any volatility that BTC has faced during the past year. Naturally, if the current BTC rally is going to last, then Strategy should maintain its greenness in the near term. As for whether the run can actually sustain, an indicator that can provide hints about it is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As analyst Ali Martinez has explained in an X post , the daily value of the metric has surged into the overbought territory recently. The RSI is a metric that basically measures the speed and magnitude of the changes happening in any asset’s price over a given period. In the current case, the period is the 14-day one. When the indicator’s value is greater than 70, it can be a sign that Bitcoin is becoming overpriced. On the other hand, it being under 30 implies underbought conditions. As is apparent from the chart, the Bitcoin RSI fell out of the overbought region earlier, but now, it has made a return to it. As such, if the indicator is anything to go by, it’s possible that BTC could encounter turbulence in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone through a rollercoaster over the past day with its price witnessing sharp swings in either direction, with the latest one taking it to $105,200.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-buys-another-7390-bitcoin-much-profit-firm/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin profit|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T12:52:33.000Z,"5 Bullish and 2 Bearish Indicators for Bitcoin as BTC Price Approaches ATH Levels","Just a month and a half ago, this article would have made no sense when BTC’s price tumbled below $75,000 and the main speculations within the community turned on whether the bull run had abruptly ended. Yesterday, bitcoin’s price stood at $30,000 higher, and it came just 2% away from breaking its all-time high from January. It sits slightly lower now, but there’s something in the air that suggests a new peak is coming. Let’s see what on-chain data and some technical indicators will say about that. The Bull Case We begin with large accumulations. After all, prices tend to rise if there’s more buying momentum, right? Lookonchain listed a number of whales that have gone on an accumulation spree in the past few days, purchasing in total over $250 million worth of BTC. Many whales are accumulating $BTC ! bc1qcp withdrew another 1,350 $BTC ($141.91M) from #Binance 8 hours ago and currently holds 20,723 $BTC ($2.19B). bc1qpu (linked to Abraxas Capital) withdrew 675 $BTC ($71.03M) from #Kraken 7 hours ago and currently holds 1,797 $BTC ($190.11M). A… pic.twitter.com/Jccvs4xhvK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 20, 2025 The accumulation group is typically led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin didn’t disappoint this week. On Monday, the NASDAQ-listed company announced the latest purchase of BTC, worth three-quarters of a billion. Metaplanet also joined the pack by acquiring over 1,000 BTC for $104 million. In the same context, it’s also worth exploring the ETF inflows, which have been in the green for most of the past month. In fact, there have been only four red examples since April 14 out of 25 trading days. According to data from Farside, the value of net inflows has surged past $3.3 billion since May 1. Finishing off the accumulations with data from Glassnode, which reads that (almost) all sorts of BTC wallets have been buying recently – it’s not just whales and corporations. Accumulation is now visible across nearly the entire wallet spectrum. Even $BTC holders have flipped from distribution to light accumulation (~0.55), joining larger cohorts like 100–1K (~0.9) and 1K–10K #BTC (~0.85). Only 1–10 #BTC remain net sellers. pic.twitter.com/C4C9ZLlwNs — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 The fifth bullish signal for bitcoin comes from a slightly different perspective, as the overall market sentiment has switched to more positive ground. This is evident from the growing number of BTC leaving exchanges and the MVRV ratio, which is far from the peak levels. The Bearish Side When there are bulls, there have to be some bears, right? Well, their narrative receives support from the daily RSI, which has gone into an overbought territory, according to data shared by Ali Martinez. #Bitcoin $BTC is currently trading in overbought territory, according to the daily RSI; a potential signal for short-term caution. pic.twitter.com/frK8sYUjyX — Ali (@ali_charts) May 19, 2025 The popular analyst shared another worrying sign for BTC’s future price movements as miners, the backbone of the world’s largest blockchain network, have gone on a selling spree in the past day or so, disposing of over $250 million worth of the asset.

The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the doldrums, falling to an intraday low of $102,145 on Monday. However, it rebounded late during the day to recoup some losses and settle at $105,573. BTC briefly pushed above $106,000 during the ongoing session before declining to its current levels. Despite the drop during the ongoing session, BTC is up over 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) bounced back, registering an increase of nearly 7% to reclaim $2,500 and move to its current level of $2,551. Ripple (XRP) registered an increase of 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 2% and is on the verge of reclaiming $170. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 2%, and Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 2%, trading at $0.740. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. As a result, the crypto market cap increased by over 2% to $3.34 trillion. India’s Supreme Court Asks Why Crypto Trading Can’t Be Regulated The Supreme Court of India has questioned the government’s inaction in regulating cryptocurrencies in the country. The court stated that the absence of a clear legal framework creates a fertile ground for misuse. The remarks were made by a bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh while hearing a bail petition filed by Gujarat resident Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, accused of crypto-related fraud across multiple states. The bench expressed its concern over the lack of regulation in the crypto sector, stating, “Nobody is saying to stop it since you said earlier that cryptocurrency is not illegal and banning it will not be wise for the economy. Banning may be shutting your eyes to the ground reality. But what about regulating it.” Ripple Could Boost Crypto Adoption In The UAE Ripple has launched a blockchain-based cross-border payments system in the UAE. The payments system was launched in collaboration with Zand Bank and Mamo, a fintech company offering digital payment services. According to a May 19 announcement, Zand Bank and Mamo will use Ripple payments to facilitate cross-border transactions. The launch comes after Ripple secured a crypto payments license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority. The UAE is at the vanguard of crypto adoption, especially decentralized finance and stablecoins. UAE also plans to create a digital Dirham, a version of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). US Stocks Flat After US Ratings Downgrade US stocks traded flat on Monday as investors reacted to the US losing the last of its AAA credit rating. Additionally, US lawmakers advanced a tax bill expected to add to federal deficits significantly. The S&P 500 registered a marginal increase, while the Nasdaq Composite registered a 0.01% increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a 0.03% increase thanks largely to a rebound in UnitedHealth Group shares. Moody’s downgraded the US to AA1, citing persistent, large-scale deficits and significantly higher interest costs. The move came after the House Budget Committee approved a tax-and-spending plan from President Trump that would extend cuts and boost spending. SEC Playing Regulatory Jenga With Crypto: Crenshaw The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s sole Democratic commissioner has criticized the agency, accusing it of “playing a game of regulatory jenga” with its approach to crypto regulation under the Trump administration. Commissioner Crenshaw criticized the dismantling of discrete but interrelated rules on crypto and the broader market. She compared market stability to a Jenga tower, stating that the agency’s rules had been carefully developed over the years and could collapse if some rules were removed or changed. She also criticized the loss of SEC staff, adding that the agency used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comments. “Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.” Crenshaw also stated that the agency had abandoned enforcement action in the crypto market, creating what she describes as “regulation by non-enforcement.” Circle Considering Sale Amid IPO Circle is exploring the probability of a potential acquisition by Ripple or Coinbase while simultaneously preparing for its planned initial public offering. According to a report by Fortune, the company is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation either through public markets or acquisition. According to market watchers, Coinbase is the likeliest buyer. Both companies co-founded the Centre Consortium in 2018 to issue the USDC stablecoin and still share revenue from reserve interest. Ripple is also interested in acquiring Circle, and had reportedly made an offer between $4 billion and $5 billion, which was rejected. Ripple could leverage its XRP reserves to fund a deal. However, Coinbase, which holds $8 billion in cash and can raise more capital has emerged as the stronger candidate to complete an acquisition. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has clarified that Circle’s IPO will not impact their commercial ties. However, he hinted the company was open to future deals. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has had an eventful start to the week, rising over 3% on Sunday before collapsing to a low of $102,145 on Monday. However, it rebounded from this level to settle at $105,573 after briefly climbing to an intraday high of $017,111. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly rose above $106,000 during the ongoing session before experiencing another pullback. BTC still faces resistance around $106,000 but remains in a strong position overall, having posted significant gains during previous sessions, which helped it reclaim $100,000 on May 8. BTC has been consolidating above $103,000 since the previous weekend, briefly rising above $105,000 on Monday. According to analysts, BTC’s brief jump above $106,000 highlights strong fundamentals and a bullish tilt despite selling pressure at higher levels. Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, stated, “The break above key support levels and targeting the resistance zone near $107,500 suggest a strong potential for a new all-time high, driven by healthier market dynamics rather than speculative excess. Institutional interest remains a key catalyst, as evidenced by JPMorgan’s recent announcement to offer Bitcoin access via spot ETFs, a significant endorsement from a major traditional finance player following Morgan Stanley’s similar moves.” CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain highlighted a shift in BTC’s behavior around key price milestones. The analyst noted that BTC’s price surges were accompanied by steep rises in Binance’s market buy volumes and funding rates, which signaled overheated conditions. Such conditions resulted in short-term corrections as traders locked in profits. However, the current rebound is different, with funding rates on Binance stable while market buy volumes are trending downwards. BTC’s price action was muted most of last week after the May 8 rally. The price registered a marginal decline on Friday before rising nearly 2% on Saturday to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,617. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 1% and ending the weekend at $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as the price registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Price action turned bullish on Sunday as BTC rallied over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. However, it lost momentum on Monday and fell to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,573. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1% as it faces selling pressure at higher levels. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has experienced considerable volatility since Sunday as buyers and sellers struggle to gain the upper hand. Despite the volatility, the price has reclaimed the $2,500 level despite dropping to lows under $2,400 on Sunday and Monday. Santiment data has revealed that ETH exchange supply has plummeted to 4.9%, its lowest ever, indicating a shift towards long-term holding and decentralized storage. Over the last 30 days, over 1 million ETH have been moved off centralized exchanges. Analysts believe this could reduce selling pressure and set ETH up for a substantial price jump. ETH has registered a staggering increase of nearly 60% over the past month. ETH started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising to an intraday high of $2,489 on Friday before settling at $2,345. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of over 10% to cross $2,500 and settle at $2,585. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, dropping nearly 3% to settle at $2,514. ETH encountered selling pressure and volatility on Monday, falling to an intraday low of $2,408 and rising to an intraday high of $2,623 before ultimately settling at $2,496 after a marginal decline. The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising over 7%, surging past $2,600 and settling at $2,681. Source: TradingView However, ETH lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping nearly 3% on Wednesday and settling at $2,610. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as the price fell 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548. ETH attempted a recovery on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $2,648. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and ultimately settled at $2,537 after a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 2.44%, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,475. ETH encountered volatility on Sunday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. The price plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.19% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. The current session sees ETH marginally up, trading around $2,534. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is attempting to regain momentum after plunging to a low of $159 on Monday. However, it faces resistance around $175 as buyers struggle to build momentum. SOL’s price action was mixed last weekend as it registered an increase of over 5% on Friday to cross $170 and settle at $172. Buyers retained control on Saturday, and SOL moved to $177 before losing momentum on Sunday and dropping to $173. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as SOL rose 0.60% and settled at $174. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 5.50%, crossing $180 and settling at $183. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, SOL lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping nearly 4%, slipping below $180 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $176. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as the price dropped over 4%, slipping below $170 and settling at $169. Price action remained bearish on Friday and Saturday, falling 0.98% and 0.89% to settle at $165. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, SOL rebounded on Sunday, rising 4.45% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. However, the price plunged to an intraday low of $159 on Monday as selling pressure increased. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $160 and settle at $166, ultimately registering a drop of 3.77%. SOL is marginally up during the ongoing session, dropping from an intraday high of $173 to its current level of $167. A bearish MACD suggests sellers have the upper hand. If sellers regain control, the price could slip below $160. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) registered a significant decline last week, plunging below $3 and the 50-day SMA as selling pressure peaked. TIA started the previous weekend on a bullish note, surging over 11% on Friday and nearly 10% on Saturday to cross $3 and settle at $3.34. The price lost momentum on Sunday, dropping over 4% and settling at $3.20, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $3.20. TIA encountered volatility on Monday, rising to an intraday high of $3.36 and falling to an intraday low of $3.01 before settling at $3.16, ultimately registering a drop of 1.16%.

TIA started the week on a bearish note, plunging to an intraday low of $2.51 before rebounding and settling at $2.64. The current session sees the price down nearly 2%, trading at $2.59. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) registered a stunning increase of nearly 28% on Saturday, surging to $0.484. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, fell almost 7%, and settled at $0.451. The price attempted a recovery on Monday but lost momentum, dropping 4.57% and settling at $0,430. ARB plunged to an intraday low of $0.406 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. It rebounded from this level to register an increase of 6.18% and settle at $0.457.

Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell over 2% and settled at $425. TAO registered a marginal decline on Saturday but encountered volatility on Sunday, rising to an intraday high of $440 and falling to an intraday low of $397 before settling at $425, ultimately registering a marginal increase.

2025-05-20T12:45:00.000Z,"Avalanche-backed Fusion launches with $100M to boost blockchain adoption","Avalanche, Helix and Faculty Group have launched Fusion, a new blockchain ecosystem aimed at driving real-world adoption through modular infrastructure tailored to specific industries. Built on Avalanche, Fusion features a two-layer architecture that includes composers, customizable layer-1 networks and modules, which offer plug-and-play services like compute, identity and data oracles. The team said this approach would be the answer for mainstream adoption, as they attempt to deliver “outcome-driven, domain-specific” blockchain-based economies. “In order to achieve widespread adoption, our industry needs to shift from selling blockspace to delivering business value,” a Fusion spokesperson told Cointelegraph. They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes. Fusion expects traction in composer and module development The Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years. “Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. Fusion’s architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added. “Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche’s position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value. Related: Indonesia’s DigiAsia shares pop 90% on plan to raise $100M to buy Bitcoin $100 million fund to come from existing Avalanche programs The project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs. According to Fusion’s announcement, the funds will come from Avalanche’s Multiverse, an incentive program to accelerate the adoption of Avalanche subnets, and Retro9000, a grant program that rewards developers who build infrastructure and tools. Fusion also uses funds from InfraBUIDL and InfraBUIDL AI, programs designed to fund Avalanche-based projects. “The funds will be distributed to support the medium-term growth of the Fusion ecosystem, including composers, modules and end-users,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

Hong Kong leads with Bitcoin ETF approval and stablecoin rules as region sets global regulatory standard. Private banks report growing demand for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and Chinese equities across Asia. Digital assets are catching on fast among investors worldwide, with Asia leading the charge as wealthy individuals shift away from traditional US dollar-based portfolios.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation. Robinhood is committed to leading this trend under a compliant framework,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said.Related: SEC Chair: Blockchain ‘holds promise’ of new kinds of market activityTokenization gains momentumRobinhood’s proposal comes amid a renewed wave of interest in RWA tokenization, with major players from both traditional finance and crypto making headlines last week.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a blockchain-based share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, allowing a digital ledger to mirror investor ownership. On the same day, Libre revealed plans to tokenize $500 million in Telegram debt via its new Telegram Bond Fund.On May 1, MultiBank Group inked a $3 billion tokenization deal with UAE real estate firm MAG and blockchain provider Mavryk.“The recent surge isn’t arbitrary. It’s happening because everything’s lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph. “Rules are getting clearer in major markets. The tech is stronger, faster, and ready to scale.

The company said these systems are unprepared for AI and are hindering the growth of the agent economy. Neville said in a news release that AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions, but noted that financial systems are unprepared.The company said AI agents are becoming “powerful economic participants,” and the world’s financial infrastructure can’t keep up. Catana described the infrastructure as “slow, expensive, full of global friction, inflexible and ill-suited to the new opportunities and risks of AI.”The company said this prompted them to create an AI-native financial institution to address the challenges of traditional financial systems. “That’s why we’re building an AI-native financial institution that will give AI agents, and the businesses and consumers they serve, the ability to transact safely and efficiently,” Neville said. In addition to the announcement, the team also shared an Agent Commerce Kit (ACK), an open-source set of patterns, components and emerging protocols for verifiable agent identity.

They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes.  Fusion expects traction in composer and module developmentThe Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years.“Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailGovernment says review may followThe Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation.The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time.The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio.

Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity.

Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress.

GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ripple tried to purchase Circle on April 30, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low.If Ripple or Coinbase were to buy Circle, the details of a purchase would differ. Ripple would pay using cash and XRP (XRP), a cryptocurrency that Ripple created. Coinbase, on the other hand, would use cash and stock.Coinbase and Circle have a relationship dating to 2018, when they launched the Centre Consortium. That venture was meant to establish standards for fiat-backed stablecoins, including USDC. Coinbase also has an agreement with Circle to put USDC onto its exchange.Circle filed for an IPO on April 1 with a goal to complete the process by the end of that month.

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart.

Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00. This would bring the total losses to 14% from the current levels.XRP/USD four-hour chart.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
