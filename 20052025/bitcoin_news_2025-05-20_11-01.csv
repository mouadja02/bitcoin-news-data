2025-05-20T08:53:44.000Z,"Why is Bitcoin price up today?","Key points: Bitcoin gained 3% to above $105,000 on May 20, fueled by high open interest in the futures market and increasing institutional demand. A classic bullish pattern is in play, targeting BTC price at $138,000 and beyond. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is up today, rising over 3% in the last 24 hours to over $105,500 on May 20. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the BTC/USD pair climbed as much as 5% to an intraday high of $107,148 on May 20 from a low of $102,100 on May 19. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Let’s take a look at the factors driving up Bitcoin price today. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows boost BTC price Bitcoin's recent price rise coincides with rising capital inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighting the growing demand for regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows 18 out of the last 21 days, accumulating a total of $6.9 billion in new capital in three weeks, as per data from Farside Investors . Spot Bitcoin ETF total cumulative flow. Source: Farside Investors Additional data from CoinShares reveals that institutional investors asserted their optimism in crypto markets as $785 million flowed into crypto investment products , marking a five-week streak of inflows. Bitcoin investment products attracted $557 million in inflows over the past week, indicating growing investor confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. More institutional demand came from corporate investors, with Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, the top corporate Bitcoin holder, acquiring 7,390 BTC worth about $765 million last week. Japan’s Metaplanet has bagged another 1,004 BTC for about $129 million as per a May 19 announcement . With increasing institutional demand for Bitcoin, the price is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory toward all-time highs and into price discovery . Bitcoin OI hit all-time highs An increase in open long BTC positions in the futures market preceded Bitcoin’s rally to $107,000 . Bitcoin’s total open interest (OI) in the derivatives market increased to an all-time high of $72.63 billion on May 20 from $57.1 billion on April 19, data from CoinGlass shows.

Additionally, Bitcoin CME futures OI also hit a 90-day high of 157,875 BTC on May 19, worth approximately $16.76 billion at the time, as per Glassnode data. Bitcoin CME futures national OI. Source: CryptoQuant With the current strong demand for BTC futures contracts , investors are expecting Bitcoin to continue its uptrend similar to the one that occurred between late October 2024 and December 2024, when rising OI accompanied BTC’s 84% rally to its previous all-time highs of $108,000 reached on Dec. 16, 2024. Bitcoin’s cup-and-handle pattern targets $138,00 From a technical perspective, the BTC/USD pair has been forming a cup-and-handle chart pattern on its daily chart since Dec. 17, 2024. A cup and handle setup is a technical formation that appears when the price falls initially, followed by a steady recovery in what appears to be a U-shaped recovery, which forms the cup. The recovery leads to a pullback move, wherein the price trends lower inside a descending channel, forming the handle. The pattern is resolved when the price breaks above the handle, rallying to an approximately equal size to the prior decline. The BTC/USD daily chart below illustrates a similar bullish technical setup. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Note that BTC's price now trades above the handle range and is pursuing a break above the neckline resistance at $106,000. A decisive daily candlestick close above the neckline could lead the BTC price to confront resistance from the $109,000 all-time high. Breaking this barrier would clear the path toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $138,000, up 31% from the current level. As Cointelegraph reported , a move to new highs of $116,000 could come as early as this week. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-20T08:45:11.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Rally Has More Room as These Crucial Metrics Align","With crypto assets quietly moving off exchanges and important metrics pointing away from overheated conditions, the momentum seems to be far from being exhausted. Several factors are at play, which suggest a growing case for the rally’s continuation. Market Sentiment Tilts Bullish Over 3,090 BTC, which is worth approximately $325 million, were withdrawn from Binance in a single day. This follows a pattern of large-scale outflows, including 76,000 ETH from Binance and 170,000 ETH from Kraken. This steady outflow of BTC and ETH from centralized exchanges signals ongoing bullish accumulation behavior among investors. With fewer coins held on exchanges, the available liquid supply shrinks, lowering the risk of abrupt selloffs and fostering an environment ripe for price appreciation if demand persists. According to the latest on-chain data from CryptoQuant, these movements coincide with significant developments in the crypto industry, such as Circle’s push toward a public listing and acquisition talks reportedly involving Coinbase and Ripple . Other factors at play also suggest favorable market conditions. For instance, the current state of Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Sitting at 2.33, the MVRV remains well below the historically significant level of 2.75, which in the past marked the beginning of prolonged corrections triggered by profit-taking. This relatively moderate MVRV indicates Bitcoin is neither overheated nor at a major profit-taking threshold. Such a trend essentially indicates a potential for further upward price action. As such, these data points reinforce a positive market outlook: institutional interest, reduced exchange reserves, and a non-excessive MVRV ratio all suggest that Bitcoin’s current rally may still have legs. No Sleepy Summer Historically, summer has been a slow season for crypto, with Q3 often posting the lowest trading volumes – except in 2022’s crisis-driven spike. But 2025 is shaping up differently. According to Kaiko, multiple macro and regulatory catalysts are converging to shake up the usual lull. The Fed’s upcoming policy meeting and Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline are key near-term events, while landmark US crypto legislation is expected before Congress’s August recess. Options markets also reflect this increased anticipation, as evidenced by the June 27 expiry, which shows a notable bullish activity at $110K and $120K strikes for Bitcoin. This aggressive positioning signals traders aren’t expecting a quiet quarter. In fact, they appear to be bracing for volatility and potential upside. With institutional interest intact and macro risks mounting, this summer could defy seasonal patterns.

Động lực này phần lớn đến từ việc giá Bitcoin vượt mốc $100.000, làm gia tăng khẩu vị rủi ro đối với các token đầu cơ. Không chỉ giá tăng mạnh, khối lượng giao dịch của các meme coin Solana cũng tăng vọt – một chỉ báo cho thấy dòng tiền đang đổ vào phân khúc này.

May 1, 2025: PI price was $0.6135 May 12: It surged to $1.6704 (113.20% growth) May 14 onwards: Price dropped by 40.27% Current (May 20): Trading around $0.7364 — down 32.3% in the last 7 days Atlas claims this dump aligns exactly with the price crash, indicating what he calls a clear insider “pump and dump” strategy. Pi Network: Boom or Bust? Launched as a mobile-first mining platform , Pi Network gained rapid traction, boasting over 60 million users globally. The project finally launched its Mainnet in early 2025 , triggering a price surge of over 2,737% in the first week . However, critics point to a lack of transparency , no working dApps , and closed-source code as major red flags. Atlas highlights the following concerns: Low number of active wallets despite 60M users No real adoption or utility Heavy reliance on a multi-level referral system Absence of communication around the 12M token movement “Stop watching announcements. Watch the wallets.” — Atlas .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin News: 14M Tokens Shifted from Exchange to Wallets, Bullish Case Explained , PI Community Reacts: Testnet Migration or Insider Dump?

But Atlas dismisses this defense, calling out the timing, wallet linkages , and lack of public explanation . He believes the project is orchestrating the “biggest slow rug” of 2025. What’s Next for PI Network? With the price down and allegations mounting, all eyes are now on the PI Core Team for clarity.

2025-05-20T08:25:23.000Z,"Chainalysis Says Haowang Shutdown Fails to Dismantle Crypto Scam Networks","The closure of Haowang Guarantee, once the largest illicit online marketplace for crypto scammers, is far from a final blow to crypto crime, according to a report published Monday by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Haowang, previously known as Huione Guarantee, was a Telegram-based marketplace offering money laundering services, stolen data, and scam technology without requiring identity verification. Its shutdown followed a sweeping crackdown by Telegram after the U.S. Treasury’s FinCEN identified Haowang’s parent, the Cambodian-based Huione Group, as a money laundering operation linked to North Korean cyber actors. Criminal Ecosystem Behind ‘Guarantee’ Services Proves Resilient Telegram also removed accounts connected to Xinbi Guarantee, the second-largest platform of its kind. These actions were hailed as progress in disrupting scam networks that had taken root on encrypted messaging platforms. But Chainalysis warned that the victory is more symbolic than structural. In its report, Chainalysis said the criminal ecosystem around “guarantee” services has proven highly adaptable. “These services are likely designed for redundancy, speaking to the resilience of criminals and the lucrative nature of their businesses,” the report noted. Vendors who once operated on Haowang have already moved to new platforms or split across several smaller marketplaces. The same users, Chainalysis said, quickly adjust to new brokers and communication channels, reducing the impact of isolated takedowns. “For now, the Huione Group takedown may shift some traffic, scramble broker relationships, or inspire short-term caution,” Chainalysis added, “but the structural enablers of crypto crime unfortunately remain intact.” Telegram continues to serve as the primary base for these illicit operations due to its ease of access and pseudonymous features. Despite promises of enforcement, the platform has not disclosed whether further crackdowns will follow. Chainalysis concluded that while platform removals may draw headlines, lasting progress against crypto scams will depend on more advanced, behavioral-focused monitoring of blockchain transactions. Rather than solely dismantling platforms, the firm urges efforts to track illicit funds through on-chain movement patterns, where real-time data may expose fraud even when platforms go dark. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets—a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence.

2025-05-20T08:16:43.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court Questions Centre Over Lack of Clear Crypto Policy","The Supreme Court of India has sought answers from the Centre on why it hasn’t formed “clear-cut” crypto regulations. The court questioned the Centre’s lack of action on framing crypto policies. The matter came into light on Monday while hearing a case from a petitioner who faced allegations of cryptocurrency fraud. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said that unregulated Bitcoin trading was “nothing but a more polished form of Hawala.” Per a local report , they suggested that regulation could provide supervision on the sector and curb its use in illicit operations. “Why does Centre not come out with a clear-cut policy on regulating cryptocurrency?” the court asked on Monday. “There is a parallel under-market for it and it can affect the economy. By regulating the cryptocurrency, you can keep an eye on the trade.” Banning Crypto Will Not Be Wise: Supreme Court Further, the court emphasized that almost “two years ago” it had sought clarification on India’s stance towards digital assets. The Justice bench has also said that banning these wouldn’t be a wise decision, but regulating them would be. “Nobody is saying to stop it, because wouldn’t not be wise for the economy,” the court observed. “Banning may be shutting your eyes from ground reality. But what about regulating it?” (Shailesh Babulal Bhatt v.

He came and said that we can't.… pic.twitter.com/OTcDVdlPbf — Bar and Bench (@barandbench) May 19, 2025 Additionally, the court advocated the matter to be taken up in consultation with experts. “We aren’t experts. Experts would examine it, but some steps to regulate it and have an eye on it.” Besides, Bitcoin trading profits taxed at 30% implies a form of “legal recognition,” the court added. “If it is already acknowledged in this manner, why not regulate it.” Disconnect Between Bitcoin Trading Boom and Govt’s Sluggish Regulatory Response This is not the first time India’s highest court has addressed the government’s unresponsive nature on regulating cryptocurrencies. Early this month, law authorities highlighted the growing disconnect between rising Bitcoin trading and lack of proper regulations. The same two-judge bench reiterated that the legality of Bitcoin trading remains murky in India. In February 2022, the court had asked the government to clarify whether cryptocurrency trading was legal in India and to outline a roadmap for enforcement. However, in January 2024, the Centre responded to the court’s questions saying that a decision on regulating cryptocurrencies was still pending.

2025-05-20T08:14:05.000Z,"Bitcoin options data suggest spike in volatility despite seasonal calm ahead: Kaiko","Bitcoin traders are pricing in higher volatility into June and July, defying the usual summer slowdown, analysts say. Crypto traders might want to cancel their summer vacations as options markets are flashing signs that the coming months could be anything but quiet. Despite the season’s reputation for sluggish activity, where both crypto and equities often cool off, current data suggests the market might be in for a hotter, more volatile stretch, Kaiko’s analysts say. In a recent research note, the analysts pointed out that since 2020, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has regularly seen its lowest trading volumes during the third quarter — peak summer months — except in 2022, when a wave of bankruptcies, including Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital , sent markets into turmoil. Bitcoin quarterly trade volume since 2020 | Source: Kaiko You might also like: JPMorgan to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, ETF access reportedly on the table The data shows that “options markets are already pricing in higher volatility,” a clear signal that something unusual may be on the horizon. In particular, June 27 expiry options have seen a spike in volume, with bullish bets targeting eye-catching strike prices of $110,000 and $120,000. These positions suggest some traders expect Bitcoin to reach new highs, even as macroeconomic uncertainty lingers. Several catalysts are converging to stir up market expectations. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting could impact broader financial conditions, while former President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline introduces added geopolitical risk, the analysts say. At the same time, major U.S. crypto legislation is anticipated before Congress breaks for its August recess, adding further uncertainty to the months ahead. Traditionally, summer brings a cooldown. Stock trading volume in August tends to drop significantly. Crypto often follows suit, with on-chain and exchange volumes typically slumping in August. For instance, spot trading fell by nearly 20% in August 2023, and total exchange volume dropped by over 11%, according to market data.

2025-05-20T08:10:42.000Z,"Vanguard may allow Bitcoin ETF trading if BTC hits over $150k, analyst says","Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted that asset manager Vanguard will unlikely launch a spot in the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. In a post on X, Balchunas said the firm might eventually allow its clients to trade the Bitcoin ETFs through its platform. According to Balchunas, the demand from Vanguard clients could force the firm to change its position once Bitcoin gets to the $150,000 – $200,000 range. My take: Vanguard won't launch a bitcoin ETF prob ever. But.. I could see them lightening up and letting them be traded on their platform in next year or two, esp if bitcoin hits $150k or $200k, they gonna get sick of being asked about it by customers and their new CEO is one of… https://t.co/SHj75lywUo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 19, 2025 Balchunas added that, due to the fact that Vanguard’s current CEO, Salim Ramji, is also one of the creators of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT could eventually influence its decision to allow it. Ramji led the BlackRock ETF business before moving to Vanguard. Other experts also appear to agree with Balchunas’s take. Many previously predicted that Vanguard would eventually offer its users access to a Bitcoin ETF. One analyst noted that Vanguard will likely gain more exposure to Bitcoin through its VOO ETF once Strategy MSTR joins the S&P 500. Vanguard stands alone as more institutions embrace Bitcoin Vanguard’s decision not to issue Bitcoin ETFs or allow the trading of existing Bitcoin ETFs on its platform makes it unique compared to other asset issuers. The firm claims to focus on tested and trusted products to help investors protect their money, especially during downturns. However, Bitcoin’s consistently strong performance means that many Vanguard users without exposure to the asset are now complaining. Interestingly, some customers are also considering migrating to other brokers offering access to Bitcoin products. For instance, Fidelity and BlackRock, major competitors of Vanguard, have their own Bitcoin ETFs and allow users to trade other crypto ETFs on their platforms. Even better, these firms also allow other Bitcoin-focused products with Fidelity trading platforms, allowing exposure to Metaplanet stock. Meanwhile, if Vanguard eventually changes its mind, it will not be the first traditional institution to do a 180-degree turnaround on Bitcoin. Investment bank JP Morgan recently announced that it will allow its customers to buy Bitcoin. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced the move, which marks a complete departure from Dimon’s previous criticisms of the crypto industry and Bitcoin, which he considers a Ponzi scheme and tool for criminals. Interestingly, Dimon’s anti-Bitcoin position remains with the executive. He notes that he will never buy BTC personally, but will let personal sentiment prevent JP Morgan customers from accessing it. He noted that he would defend customers’ right to buy Bitcoin just as he would defend a person’s right to smoke a cigarette. Bitcoin steadies at $105k as the market looks for a new all-time high While traditional institutions continue to change their stance on Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset has been up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. It now appears to have broken out of the $104,000 range after peaking at $106,814 today before settling above $105,000. BTC’s positive performance means it has been up 11.88% year to date. Its positive performance has allowed altcoins to see massive gains today, even as they pale compared to long-term price movements. It is unclear what is responsible for the recent increase in value, but there are lots of positive fundamentals backing it up. According to crypto analyst Carmelo Alemán , Bitcoin has accumulated over $906 billion in realized capitalization. Realized capitalization describes the total amount invested in Bitcoin, which has been trending upward for four consecutive weeks. If that trend continues, experts believe BTC will reach a new ATH. Bitcoin realized cap (Source: CryptoQuant) He said: “If the trend of increasing Realized Capitalization continues, suggesting ongoing investor confidence in Bitcoin, it is very likely that Bitcoin will surpass its ATH in the near future. This could set the stage for a historic bull run.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot net volume in the US dollar is now up on Binance, a signal that selling pressure has declined and buying activity is increasing.

The court likened unregulated Bitcoin trading to a “hawala business,” an informal and often illegal method of transferring money, highlighting the potential for misuse and economic impact. The justices emphasized the necessity of monitoring and controlling digital currencies effectively, urging the central authorities to expedite the creation of comprehensive regulations.

Justice Suryakant remarked, “If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it.” This call for regulation comes amid ongoing investigations into illegal Bitcoin trading activities, such as the case involving Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who is accused of extorting significant amounts of cryptocurrencies and cash. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court dismissed a ₹2,000Cr . The WazirX hack case is only because India still has no clear crypto regulation . Victims were told to “approach RBI, SEBI, or CBI”, the same institutions that have avoided crypto accountability for years. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India’s Crypto Regulation Gets Stricter in 2025: Mandatory KYC Update by June 30! , India is losing the crypto investors!

According to luxury real estate advisor Aishwaraya Shri Kapoor , the country’s top 0.001% are building portfolios worth ₹75–500 crore, focusing on land and branded real estate. These high-net-worth individuals are acquiring high-value land parcels, branded residences, pre-leased commercial floors, trophy penthouses, and heritage properties across major cities in India and abroad.

2025-05-20T08:08:49.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge as Basis Trade Nears 9%, Signaling Renewed Demand","The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $667.4 million in net inflows on May 19, the largest single-day total since May 2, signaling renewed institutional interest. Nearly half of these inflows, $306 million, went into iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), now at $45.9 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. The renewed demand follows bitcoin’s strong price performance, having traded above $100,000 for 11 consecutive days, which has helped restore market confidence. Additionally, the annualized basis trade, a strategy where investors go long on the spot ETF and simultaneously short bitcoin futures contracts on the CME, has become increasingly attractive, with yields approaching 9% almost double what was seen in April. According to Velo data, this has sparked a modest uptick in basis trade activity as evidenced by an increase in trading activity in the CME futures. On Monday, CME futures volumes hit $8.4 billion (roughly 80,000 BTC), the highest since April 23. Meanwhile, open interest stood at 158,000 BTC, up over 30,000 BTC contracts from April’s lows, further underscoring the growing appetite for leveraged and arbitrage strategies. That said, both both futures volume and open interest remain well below the levels seen during bitcoin’s all-time high of $109,000 in January, indicating there’s still significant headroom for further growth. The upswing in the basis suggests the growth may be already happening, bringing back players that left the market early this year when the basis dropped to under 5%. Recent 13F filings revealed that the Wisconsin State Pension Board exited its ETF position in Q1, likely in response to a then-less favorable basis trade environment. However, given that 13F data lags by a quarter and the basis spread has since widened from 5% to nearly 10%, it is plausible that they have re-entered the market in Q2 to capitalize on the improved arbitrage opportunity.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/20/bitcoin-etf-inflows-surge-as-basis-trade-nears-9-signaling-renewed-demand,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet . On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero ( XMR ). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions. Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses. Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers , further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339. The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms , making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms. Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft. This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility. What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved? Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans: Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit. These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required. Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust. Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible. Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders. High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users. Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking. Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance. Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds. Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work. Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use: Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets. Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets. Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers. Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems. Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks. Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses. Ronin Network attack In March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity , suffered a $600 million exploit . Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offer The Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions. Discord phishing scams Discord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses. Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users. How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks: Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers. Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters. Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access. Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters. Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source. Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand. Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|XMR","Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender. On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health. Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse. As per the complaint , Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin ( BTC ), 69,197 Ether ( ETH ) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025. At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments. DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcy The complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors. “In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks. “GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants. Source: GenesisLOC Related: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuring A second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy. These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent. Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed. Genesis seeks to recover billions In total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits. In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward. The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note. While Gemini and Genesis have settled , DCG and the executives have fought the charges . Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.

2025-05-20T08:01:07.000Z,"Bitcoin Bull SEC Member Makes Interesting Cryptocurrency Proposal","Speaking at the SEC Speaks conference, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Hester Peirce called for a new era in the regulatory approach to crypto assets. Peirce has proposed a time-limited “safe harbor” proposal that would see cryptocurrency projects exempt from securities regulations under certain conditions. Hester Peirce: “There Should Be a Certain Period of Time for Cryptocurrencies Not to Be Considered as Securities After Their Launch” According to Peirce’s proposal, crypto assets that could be included in the scope of investment contracts could be exempted from SEC registration obligations for a limited period of time if they meet certain transparency and investor protection requirements. During this process, projects would be given time to add functionality or decentralize the network. Peirce also said that airdrops, NFTs and some stablecoin types should be considered outside the scope of securities, and argued that clear and permanent exceptions should be made for these assets. Peirce, who took office as the SEC’s Crypto Task Force Chair, stated that to date, the commission has created uncertainty in crypto regulation and its approach to penalizing the industry has been inadequate. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Responds to Allegations of Stealing $600 Million Worth of ADA “The biggest problem with crypto is that it is not clear when a crypto asset that starts under an investment contract can be traded as an independent asset,” Peirce said, adding that clear criteria should be defined for when the investment contract’s connection with the crypto asset is severed. Peirce also said that the Commission’s past litigation has pushed entrepreneurs out of the U.S., so it’s time to create a regulatory framework that respects investor protection but also encourages innovation. “Initial sales may be securities, but assets that become functional or decentralized should no longer be covered by that contract,” he said. Under the new safe harbor framework, issuers are expected to be required to publicly disclose their commitments and regularly notify investors about goals such as fulfilling the technical functionality of the network or decentralization. Peirce also called for a special exemption regime to ensure that token distributions, particularly via airdrops, are not considered registered sales. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T07:52:52.000Z,"Bitcoin and Gold in Sweet Spot as Bond Market 'Smackdown' Exposes the U.S. Fiscal Kayfabe: Godbole","There is a popular saying , that goes, \""If you want to understand America, watch a pro wrestling match.\"" Though it may be glib and a little over simplified, it appears to 'ring' true, as the U.S. financial markets are now exhibiting traits similar to pro-wrestling's concept of \"" kayfabe .\"" Kayfabe means an illusion that the in-ring scripted action is real, with the audience buying the same while suspending their belief for entertainment. A similar dynamic has played out in the financial market for at least a decade, where the U.S. government has repeatedly hit its self-imposed debt ceiling , or borrowing limit, a sign of fiscal crisis. Still, investors continued lending money to the government at ultra-low yields, including during times of stress in the global economy, thereby maintaining the kayfabe that the government is a safe and reliable borrower. Recently, however, bond market participants have exposed kayfabe, as legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones had warned , weakening the illusion and strengthening the case for investing in assets with haven and store-of-value appeal like bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Bonds blast the kayfabe This week's big news is the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield topping the 5% mark and how it could destabilize financial markets. However, we have been there before in October last year, according to the data source TradingView. Read more: U.S. 30-Year Treasury Yield Breaches 5% Amid Moody's Rating Downgrade, Fiscal Concerns The real story is the spike in yields on the Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). Their principal amount is adjusted for inflation. The 30-year TIPS yield recently rose above 2.7%, the highest since 2001. In other words, investors demand a yield at least 2.7% greater than inflation in return for loaning money to the government for three decades. This comes as the consumer price index (CPI) growth continued to slow toward the Fed's 2% target, and the market-based forward-looking inflation measures like breakevens remain stable in familiar ranges seen since 2022. Plus, the supposedly inflationary U.S.-China tariff war has eased. Divergence is a clear indicator that investors are seeking the most expensive real yield due to concerns about fiscal policy and not inflation, tariffs, or growth dynamics. \""The world is saying, we don't trust your long-term fiscal trajectory and we want to be compensated for it,\"" pseudonymous analyst EndGame Macro said in an explainer on X. As of May 19, the U.S. national debt, also known as the total public debt, stood at $36.22 trillion. It is projected to rise by $22 trillion over the next 10 years, with debt-to-GDP reaching 156% by 2055 , according to analysis conducted by EY's Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) practice. The QUEST report also said the burgeoning debt will weigh heavily on economic growth. Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, pointed to the five-year forward real interest rate as evidence of bond players questioning the fiscal sustainability. \""The 5y5y forward real interest rate now stands at 2.5%, which is the highest level going all the way back to 2010. Most importantly, it far exceeds levels seen during hawkish Fed episodes, like the 2013 \""taper tantrum\"" or the 2022/23 hiking cycle after the COVID inflation scare,\"" Brooks said in a Substack post , while noting the stability in the 5y5y forward inflation breakevens. \""That makes it all the more likely that many years of irresponsible fiscal policy are catching up with the U.S, adding urgency to the need to get our fiscal house in order,\"" Brooks added. FX-bond correlations are dead Another sign that the market is waking up to the fact that the emperor has no clothes is the breakdown in the traditional correlation between the foreign exchange (forex) and bond markets. Typically, rising bond yields boost the appeal of the home currency, causing it to appreciate against other fiat currencies. For example, the EUR/USD has historically closely tracked the spread between yields on German and U.S. two-year government bonds. But not anymore. The EUR/USD has risen sharply since early April despite the narrowing of the two-year yield differential, led by a sharp rise in the U.S. two-year yield. The breakdown in correlations indicates that concerns over fiscal stability have likely prompted investors to move away from U.S. assets. The degree of dollar bearishness is evident from the options market, which is now most bullish on EUR/USD since COVID. It's unusual for the options market to put a greater premium on the upside in euro than the downside, according to Brooks. Bullish bitcoin and gold Historically, governments facing fiscal concerns have resorted to inflation and repaying debt by printing more money. They will likely retake the same road, incentivizing demand for hard assets like gold and bitcoin. \""All roads lead to inflation. That’s historically the way every civilization has gotten out is that they inflated away their debts,\"" Tudor Jones said last year, while naming BTC, gold, and commodities as preferred holdings over longer duration bonds. Two years ago, Economist Russell Napier voiced a similar opinion, saying , \""We need to prepare for an era of increasing financial repression and persistently high inflation.\"" Financial repression refers to government policies that direct funds from the private sector to the public sector to help reduce national debt. The scenario is characterized by the inflation rate exceeding the return on savings, capital controls and interest rate caps, all of which could bode well for bitcoin and gold. Interest rate caps are usually implemented through policies like yield curve control, which has the central bank targeting a specific level for the long bond yields, let's say 5%. Every time, the yield looks to rise above the said level, the central bank steps up bond purchases, injecting liquidity into the system. Arthur Hayes, CIO and founder of Maelstrom, has said that yield curve control will eventually be implemented in the U.S., torching a record rally in bitcoin. Hayes recently said that President Donald Trump's decision to water down trade tariffs after early April panic in financial markets is evidence that the financial system is too levered for tough reforms and warrants additional money creation. “They can call it whatever they want—just don’t call it QE—but it has the same effect: liquidity rises and Bitcoin benefits,\"" Hayes said . Impending rally won't be smooth The bullish case for BTC does not necessarily mean there won't be hiccups. The U.S. Treasury market serves as a bedrock of global finance and increased volatility in these bonds could cause financial tightening, potentially triggering a global dash for cash that sees investors sell every asset, including bitcoin. As of now, however, the MOVE index, which represents the 30-day implied or expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, remains in a downtrend.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/20/bitcoin-and-gold-in-sweet-spot-as-bond-markets-expose-the-u-s-fiscal-kayfabe-omkar-godbole,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Markets|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T07:50:47.000Z,"Crypto lending group Genesis sues parent company over $2.1B in disputed transfers","Crypto lender Genesis Global Capital has launched legal action against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis has brought legal action in the courts of Delaware and New York following bankruptcy proceedings, which concluded in August 2024. The litigation seeks to recover approximately $2.1 billion in disputed transfers to benefit creditors. Genesis accuses DCG and executives of fraud and self-dealing The lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by Genesis Global Capital contains serious allegations against Digital Currency Group, its founder and CEO Barry Silbert, and other company insiders. In order to pay back the creditors of the cryptocurrency lender, the complaint requests the recovery of one million coins, which are worth around $2.1 billion. According to court documents made public on Monday, Genesis accuses DCG and its leadership of engaging in reckless loan activities and operating without reasonable risk management protocols. According to the petition, the defendants allegedly took advantage of Genesis’ creditors and consumers by using “other people’s money” to profit themselves. The partially redacted complaint details what Genesis describes as an intentional “misinformation” campaign where Silbert and other executives allegedly misled customers about the company’s financial stability. The suit claims DCG manipulated financial disclosures to hide the true state of the business while benefiting DCG and its bitcoin trust, Grayscale Investments LLC. Philippe Selendy of Selendy Gay, who represented the Genesis litigation oversight committee, spoke about the situation. He stated it was showing “a pattern of self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement that deprived hundreds of individual Genesis creditors and institutional lenders of billions of dollars of value in crypto and fiat assets.” The Delaware case is one of the most significant bodies of litigation in Genesis’ overall strategy following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in January 2023. The company finalized restructuring in August 2024 and distributed around $4 billion in cash and cryptocurrency to the creditors. The plan, to which DCG objected, involved a $2.2 billion payout to Gemini Earn customers and uncapped recoveries based on prevailing asset prices. New York bankruptcy trial filing targets $1 billion of preferential transfers Genesis filed a second lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, US Bankruptcy Court, in a similar case. The suit claimed over $1 billion in allegedly wrongful transfers during the year prior to its bankruptcy filing. The suit is directed at insider transfers during Genesis’s insolvency. New York’s filing seeks to qualify these transactions as preferential transfers in bankruptcy and recover their value on behalf of the creditors. The disputed crypto payments are in excess of $582 million, and the total preferential transfers are in excess of $1.2 billion as of March 31, according to the court filing. The lawsuit mentions other transactions, including $101 million to the DCG subsidiary HQ Enhanced Yield Fund, $136 million to DCG International, and $448 million to DCG. Genesis is further claiming recovery of $34 million of tax payments to DCG. They further claimed that transfers were unauthorized and not valid liabilities. Genesis asserts that these transfers took place at a period of record market volatility in the crypto space. These were the collapse of stablecoin Terra-Luna, the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, and the FTX Trading 2022 bankruptcy scandal. The lawsuit claims that DCG was aware that Genesis’ business was on the verge of collapse during the period. “DCG recognized the existential threat to Genesis and, with it, to DCG and the Insider Defendants that had loaned Genesis hundreds of millions of dollars,” the firm stated in court documents. The lawsuit contends Genesis was actually insolvent by the end of 2021 and accumulated $14 billion in outstanding loans. The crypto lender attributes its insolvency to structural risks and inadequate internal controls that its parent company and insiders allegedly knew about but failed to address.

2025-05-20T07:48:22.000Z,"Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double top","Key points: Bitcoin is not in line to cancel its attack on all-time highs, says the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI). BTC price strength remains “intact,” says Swissblock Technologies, removing the risk of a double top. Historically, a return to within 10% of all-time highs delivers price discovery almost every time. Bitcoin ( BTC ) does not risk a “double top” bull market reversal with its trip past $107,000, new analysis says. In one of its latest X updates , private wealth manager Swissblock Technologies described BTC price strength as “intact.” BTC price indicator ignores double top “noise” Bitcoin shows “no signs of bearish divergence,” as seen through the lens of a basket of network indicators. Commenting on the latest signals from its Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), Swissblock argued that despite being less than $5,000 from all-time highs, BTC/USD is not about to abandon its push into price discovery. “A lot of noise about a potential double top as $BTC struggles to break ATH,” it said. BFI combines various extant indicators into a single oscillator to provide insight into trend strength at a given price point. Since August 2024, BFI has stuck rigidly to its middle territory around the 50/100 mark, irrespective of price action. “Even during the Feb–Mar pullback, it held neutral, never dipped into weakness,” the post notes. Swissblock explained that if BTC/USD were to reverse now and head lower, leaving all-time highs untouched, BFI would already be “breaking down.” “On-chain strength is intact,” it concluded. “Bears: not this time, got to wait.” Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI).

Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week As Cointelegraph continues to report , price discovery is expected to reenter sooner rather than later, with one BTC price target for this week already at $116,000. On that topic, network economist Timothy Peterson used statistical analysis to assume a trip to at least $115,000 by the end of June. “Bitcoin has pulled to within 10% of its all-time high,” his X post from May 9 reads. “What happens next? This has happened nearly 300 times since 2015. Within 50 days, Bitcoin made a new all-time high 98% of the time.” Peterson acknowledged that post-2020 gains have been more modest than those before, with an average 8% move giving BTC/USD a target of up to $125,000.

2025-05-20T07:40:49.000Z,"Most Americans favour converting part of US gold reserves into Bitcoin, survey finds","A recent survey has revealed that four out of five Americans support converting a portion of the country’s gold reserves into Bitcoin, marking a notable shift in public sentiment toward digital asset diversification. The poll, conducted by the Nakamoto Project—a nonprofit focused on Bitcoin education and advocacy—surveyed 3,345 Americans online between February and mid-March 2025. Respondents were asked what percentage of US gold reserves they would advise converting into Bitcoin. The majority recommended an allocation between 1% and 30%. The survey aimed to reflect the US Census distribution in age, gender, race, income, education, and geography. It was administered via Qualtrics, with participants compensated for their time. Co-founder comes in defence as survey met with skepticism Despite the strong result in favour of Bitcoin, the survey was met with skepticism on social media. Critics questioned whether only crypto-enthusiasts had been surveyed. Troy Cross, co-founder of the Nakamoto Project, acknowledged the doubts but stood by the data. “We were surprised too. But the results are the results,” he said. “When given the choice, people were hesitant to select 0% Bitcoin. Most hovered around 10%.” Troy Cross @thetrocro · Follow Many of you are skeptical of our finding, released this morning that 4 in 5 Americans would convert some US gold reserves into bitcoin.“Yeah right! You must have done your survey at a bitcoin conference!”We were also surprised too. But the results are the results.The 1:15 am · 20 May 2025 228 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Cross added that Bitcoin allocation recommendations fell as age increased—mirroring past findings of an inverse correlation between age and Bitcoin ownership. Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, echoed the sentiment, noting that the broader public seems less attached to gold than expected. “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most are naturally inclined toward diversification,” he said. Strategic interest grows in Washington The survey also found that 66% of respondents were neutral to positive about Donald Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This growing support appears to be influencing Washington’s stance. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a plan for the Treasury to buy Bitcoin using profits from the country’s gold reserves. If enacted, the proposal could see the US purchase up to 1 million BTC over five years. Hines cited Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025 as a legislative foundation. “If we actually realize the gains on these gold holdings, that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin,” he said. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in July that the US could go further, proposing that Bitcoin reserves be matched one-to-one with gold holdings. Currently, the United States holds 8,133 tons of gold worth over $830 billion, alongside 207,189 BTC valued at around $22 billion—less than 3% of its gold holdings.

A Notable Amount Of Bitcoin Has Cost Basis At $106,600 In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution for the levels nearby to the current spot price. The “Cost Basis Distribution” (CBD) here refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about how much of the asset’s supply was purchased at what price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Below is the CBD chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the data related to price levels above $101,500. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin price levels near to the all-time high (ATH) aren’t too dense with supply, meaning that not a lot of buying took place there and many investors who did buy there already capitulated. A level that immediately stands out, however, is $106,600, where holders last purchased around 31,000 BTC. According to Glassnode, this particular supply cluster originated on the 16th of December. The owners of these tokens have held tight through all the volatility that has emerged since then. Generally, large supply walls that are situated at levels higher than the spot price can act as probable points of resistance in the near future, as underwater investors can be desperate for the asset to return to their break-even level so that they can just exit with all their capital back. From the chart, it’s apparent that Bitcoin’s sharp burst of bullish momentum earlier had its price close in on this level and it did find a rejection around there. The source of the resistance wasn’t selling from the underwater holders who purchased at $106,600, however, as the supply cluster is still holding strong. It would appear that the owners of these tokens may be quite the resolute hands, as they are still waiting patiently even though the cryptocurrency is offering them an opportunity to sell. The analytics firm has noted that this could make the level an important one to watch in the short term.

In the last 24 hours, ETH has jumped 8% , climbing above $2,540 and pushing its market cap to $307 billion. This sharp move comes as ETH supply on exchanges has dropped to just 4.9%, the lowest in its 10-year history. With fewer coins available to sell, many believe a supply squeeze is kicking in. Some crypto experts say this growing scarcity could help push Ethereum to $5,000. Let’s break it down. Ethereum Hits Record-Low Exchange Supply According to new data, Ethereum’s exchange supply has dropped to an all-time low of just 4.9%, the lowest level in its 10-year history. For context, this means that out of all the ETH in circulation, less than 5% is sitting on trading platforms. Meanwhile, over the past five years, 15.3 million Ethereum have been moved off exchanges. These coins didn’t disappear, they’ve likely been transferred to cold wallets, long-term holdings, and institutional custody. LOOK: Ethereum supply on exchanges just hit ALL-TIME LOW of 4.9% in its 10-year history, while Bitcoin's exchange supply dropped to lowest level since 2018 (7.1%)!

Suddenly, we’re looking at a classic case of low supply and rising demand. Bitcoin Not Far Behind Bitcoin is showing a similar trend. Only 7.1% of the BTC supply now sits on exchanges, the lowest level since November 2018. History shows that every major bull run in crypto has been preceded by this kind of supply squeeze. The last time Bitcoin’s exchange supply was this low, it surged nearly 20x over the next couple of years. ETH Eyeing a Bigger Rally Looking at the Ethereum price, it has jumped 8% in the past 24 hours, rising from $2,346 to around $2,537. This recovery follows change in leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, where Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were named Co-Executive Directors, along with a new President.

The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve . DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. DigiAsia Eyes $100M Raise to Fuel Bitcoin Treasury Plan In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. The firm noted that it is in talks with regulated partners to develop yield-generating strategies for its Bitcoin, including lending and staking. DigiAsia is also weighing the issuance of convertible notes and crypto-linked financial instruments to support its treasury initiative. The company’s stock, which trades under the ticker FAAS, closed Monday at $0.36—a gain of more than 91% on the day. However, after-hours trading saw a sharp pullback, with shares slipping to $0.28. Despite the recent rally, DigiAsia stock is down nearly 53% year-to-date, after peaking near $12 in March. In its April financial update, DigiAsia reported a 36% increase in annual revenue, reaching $101 million in 2024. It projects revenues of $125 million for 2025, alongside expected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million. DigiAsia joins a growing list of firms moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets.

In addition to equity sales, Strategy has also expanded its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, with $14.6 billion still available under the current authorization.

Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson tells his 161,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may explode to new record high levels based on breakout patterns since April. “Bitcoin breakout (four-hour). Now that we’ve broken out of the consolidation, we have an official measured move target. Target: $115,000.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X However, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that for Bitcoin’s upward momentum to continue, the S&P 500 (SPX) needs to remain bullish based on BTC’s historic correlation with stocks. “Bitcoin, in my opinion, looks really, really good, even with the little rejection we had earlier. We’re just retesting previous resistance as new support here. So I think it’s still really likely for this to play out. But the main thing is, if the stock market allows it. The S&P has been on an epic rebound. I mean, we’re really, really close to a new all-time high for the S&P. Imagine if you told people that at the bottom of this market, when everyone was calling for a recession or a 2008-style crash, imagine if you said that in a month, we’d be back at the all-time high. Nobody would have believed you. But here we are. This is an extremely volatile market, and anything is possible in these conditions. And so my point is, as long as the S&P and the stock market in general sort of allow Bitcoin to remain bullish, then Bitcoin will probably follow that next measured move target to $115,000. If the S&P finds some sort of lower high or resistance, well then it may not be so easy to get to $115,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $106,000 at time of writing, flat on the day.

What Keeps SOL Price Below $170?","The post Are Investors Becoming Pessimistic About the Solana (SOL) Price Surge? What Keeps SOL Price Below $170? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Bitcoin price surged, investors quickly turned bearish and began to pile up short trades. This kept the entire market and the Solana price consolidated within a tight range. While the other tokens triggered a breakout as Bitcoin reclaimed $106,000, these short trades were liquidated, which resulted in a bullish breakout in many. However, the SOL price failed to do so, which raises some concern over the upcoming price rally. In a recent update, the SEC has delayed its decision on all the spot ETFs, including Bitwise and 21Shares. This delay could extend the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Solana-based investment products for institutional investors. Despite this, the price displayed some strength but is constantly failing to rise above the pivotal threshold. On the daily chart, the SOL price is showing a notable drop of nearly 6%, with the day’s candle closing below the average bands. This has compelled the price to begin the day’s trade within a consolidated zone, which could prevent the breakout for a while. The SOL price has reached the edge of the rising wedge and is testing the support of the pattern. If the price triggers a rebound, it may remain consolidated until it breaches above the 200-day MA. On the other hand, if the price initiates a breakdown, which is the outcome of the pattern, the quick sellers could be exhausted at once. Although this may cause a short-term pullback to the $145 and $147 range, a strong rebound could follow the trend. Therefore, the rebound that could follow may not see the 200-day MA as a major hindrance. As a result, a steep rise may begin, elevating the levels beyond $200. If the bulls manage to sustain the token above the gains, the Solana (SOL) price rally is expected to head towards upper targets in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/are-investors-becoming-pessimistic-about-the-solana-sol-price-surge-what-keeps-sol-price-below-170/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T06:42:20.000Z,"Ether Surges 8%, Bitcoin Nears $106K as Crypto Bulls Take Charge","Crypto markets extended their climb with ether (ETH) jumping 8% and bitcoin (BTC) inching back toward the $106,000 mark in the past 24 hours, despite broader risk-off sentiment in equities and gold. The resilience is in contrast to Friday’s surprise credit downgrade of the U.S. by Moody’s, which cited persistent fiscal deficits and political gridlock. Yet while equities sagged and gold extended its recent decline, falling nearly 7% from May highs, bitcoin held ground and even rallied briefly to $107,000 late Sunday before retracing. “Bitcoin’s ability to rally over the weekend despite a risk-off tone in equities following the Moody’s downgrade reinforces its positioning as a legitimate store of value,” QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast late Monday. The firm pointed to consistent inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and institutional demand as catalysts, even as derivatives markets saw some leveraged long liquidations. Ether was among the standout movers, surging past $2,900 in a strong follow-through move from last week’s breakout. The token’s recent strength has been tied to renewed interest in Ethereum staking flows and positive sentiment following the Pectra upgrade — though no new headline catalyst emerged on Monday. Solana’s SOL, XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) rose between 2-4%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) adding just under 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Aave’s AAVE tokens soared over 25% in the past 24 hours, though the move appeared largely speculative. No protocol-level announcement or governance proposal was immediately tied to the jump. The token is still down over 60% from its 2021 highs. Traders say the decoupling between bitcoin and traditional “hard assets” like gold is worth watching. “Unlike in previous months where BTC and gold went up in unison, bitcoin has been rising against a drop in spot gold, which is also reflected in ETF flows,” Augustine Fan of SignalPlus said in a message to CoinDesk. “Gold ETFs saw a notable drop in flows against a small rise in BTC ETFs, with a similar pattern in gold vs BTC futures on CME. We should assume more of these micro-correlation breaks and relative value opportunities to take hold,” Fan ended.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/20/ether-surges-8-bitcoin-nears-106k-as-crypto-bulls-take-charge,"BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|BNB","Markets|Ether|Bitcoin|crypto market|News",cryptocompare

Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said clients would soon be able to buy Bitcoin, though the bank itself won’t hold the asset. “We’re not going to custody it,” he noted, adding only that Bitcoin will appear “in statements for clients.” No additional details were disclosed. The move marks a notable shift for the largest U.S. bank, particularly as rival Morgan Stanley already offers access to spot Bitcoin ETFs for qualifying clients. JPMorgan is expected to offer access to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to sources cited by CNBC. Until now, the bank’s exposure to crypto has been limited to futures-based products rather than direct investment options. Still, Dimon made it clear his personal stance on Bitcoin hasn’t changed. He pointed to its association with criminal use cases, including money laundering, sex trafficking, and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he was quoted as saying. You might also like: JPMorgan’s Dimon says he will allow clients to buy Bitcoin The remarks echo what he told CBS News back in January, when he said he doesn’t believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value and likened its users to smokers, acknowledging their right to own it while discouraging it personally. At the time, he insisted he wasn’t against crypto as a whole but remained firmly opposed to Bitcoin’s utility. Dimon’s skepticism dates back years. In 2021, during a Senate hearing, he called Bitcoin “worthless” and claimed its only real use case was among “criminals, drug traffickers, and tax avoiders.” In 2018, he called it a scam and even threatened to fire JPMorgan traders who dealt with it. At Davos earlier this year, after Bitcoin surged past $100,000, he dismissed it again as “the pet rock,” insisting it “does nothing.” Despite his criticism, JPMorgan has found itself increasingly involved in the decentralized space. The bank is listed as an authorized participant in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and has praised blockchain technology, even as its CEO continues to distance himself from Bitcoin specifically.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. On an optimistic note, Solana’s TVL has crossed $10.9 billion, influenced by fee growth, increased staking, and rising DeFi use cases. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 42.74% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

2025-05-20T06:21:32.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Bullish Sentiment Builds as BTC Holds Steady—Which Altcoins Will Lead the Rotation?","As mid-May unfolds, a macro data lull offers a brief pause—but crypto market sentiment continues to rise. While major assets trend steadily upward, capital is beginning to rotate into fundamentally solid altcoins. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research shares her macro outlook and strategic insights, with a spotlight on rotation opportunities across the SUI ecosystem and the emerging AttentionFi sector. Macro Outlook: Rising Bullish Sentiment Amidst Steady Short-Term Uptrend This week’s U.S. economic calendar is light on major data releases. Market attention is primarily directed towards Federal Reserve officials’ interpretations of recent commentary suggesting a possible single interest rate cut in 2025. Analysis of options market data shows a prevailing bullish sentiment: the Call/Put open interest ratio has reached 1.55, accompanied by increasing premiums for call options. At the same time, short-term implied volatility (IV) has dropped to a new 18-month low of 35–40%. In short: the market is experiencing “euphoric sentiment amid calm volatility.” Under such conditions, Bitcoin could retest new highs within the next 30–45 days, targeting the $105K–$115K range. However, this mix of high sentiment and low volatility often conceals the build-up of excessive leverage. A sudden surge in IV or a meaningful drop below $100K could trigger a sharp deleveraging event. Strategic Positioning: Capital Rotation into High-Quality Altcoins for Momentum Capture From a capital allocation perspective, rotating a portion of capital into fundamentally strong and liquid altcoins may present an opportunity to capitalize on potential spillover momentum from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. This edition of HTX DeepThink highlights promising sectors and projects worthy of investor attention. SUI Ecosystem: All-Time High Market Cap, Undervalued Core Projec The SUI chain has reached an all-time high in market cap, but its ecosystem projects have yet to follow with substantial gains. This opens a key window for early positioning in undervalued ecosystem leaders. HTX has listed two standout projects within the SUI ecosystem: Haedal and Bluefin . Haedal is the dominant LST (liquid staking) protocol on SUI, commanding 76% of market share and benefiting from strong network effects. Bluefin , SUI’s flagship perpetual DEX, currently holds a market cap of only $31.6M yet has achieved an annualized revenue of $8.2M, implying a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 3.8x—far lower than GMX (9.1x) and Drift (12.4x). The upcoming V2 upgrade will introduce veTokenomics and new trading incentives, potentially boosting both user activity and protocol revenues. Given the rising attention on SUI’s mainnet, Haedal and Bluefin—both considered core infrastructure—appear to exhibit dual potential for valuation recovery and Beta-driven upside. These developments may warrant mid-term attention from market participants. AttentionFi: Capitalizing on Bull Market User Acquisition Premium As the current bull cycle accelerates, new Web3 projects are launching rapidly, and the cost of user acquisition is soaring. In traditional channels like Telegram, Google, or Red Note, user acquisition cost (UAC) is calculated via “traffic × conversion rate.” With CPCs at $0.5–1.0 and conversion rates around 10%, it can cost $5–10 to acquire a real, retained user. Kaito offers a far more efficient “attention engine.” Its API charges based on a combination of reputation score and meaningful engagement. As a result, project teams can acquire real users with 3–4x higher retention at just $2–3 per user—much lower than traditional channels. With this model, Kaito has grown rapidly, expanding from 30 to 120 integrated projects in the past three months, and quadrupling API call volume. Meanwhile, $KAITO staking has surged to 19.7M tokens , and the protocol has cumulatively bought back and burned 3.7M tokens , creating a strong demand-supply mismatch and deflationary pressure that supports higher price ceilings. On the Base chain’s IDO platform Virtuals , users who stake ≥5,000 $KAITO can earn Virgen Points to redeem IDO allocations. Several recent IDOs have seen 10–30x returns on day one, forming a lucrative loop: stake → points → arbitrage .However, launching a project on Kaito’s Yapper Leaderboard requires significant voting and staking budgets. Teams with limited resources can first use GiveRep to identify quality community members and reputation-based seed users at zero cost, then scale with Kaito once traction builds. GiveRep is closely aligned with the SUI Foundation and has partnered with major SUI ecosystem projects like ika and Typus , with future airdrop expectations adding further appeal. With the recent listing of $KAITO on HTX , its liquidity is expanding—and in a bull market where competition for user attention intensifies, Kaito’s combination of low-cost, high-precision targeting and deflationary tokenomics makes it a promising asset to watch. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

The survey of 3,345 respondents asked: “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?” The majority of respondents wanted between 1% and 30% converted, it revealed. 4 in 5 Americans want some US gold reserves converted to bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ibxXfe04g5 — The Nakamoto Project (@NakamotoProjct) May 19, 2025 Lots of Skepticism Project co-founder Troy Cross said many were skeptical of the findings, suggesting that only Bitcoiners were surveyed. “We were also surprised too. But the results are the results. When given a slider and asked to advise the US government on the right proportion of Bitcoin and gold, subjects were very reluctant to put that slider on 0% Bitcoin and 100% gold. Instead, they settled around 10% Bitcoin,” he explained. The recommended proportions of BTC dropped significantly with age, which was not surprising given the inverse relationship the organization found in a previous survey between age and Bitcoin ownership. Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter said he didn’t believe it at first, adding that: “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most people are inclined towards diversification when given the choice.” The survey, which ran between February and mid-March, was conducted online, and participants were paid. However, the survey and data collection company Qualtrics was asked to match the US Census distribution in terms of age, gender, race, income, education, and geography as closely as possible, he added. The study also revealed that around 66% of respondents were neutral-to-positive about Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Uncle Sam also holds around 207,189 BTC worth around $22 billion, less than 3% of its gold reserves, according to BiTBO, so there is plenty of room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a new strategy that the Treasury might start buying Bitcoin using profits from its gold reserves. This plan, if enacted, could lead to the purchase of up to 1 million BTC over five years. He referenced Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, stating in March, “If we actually realize the gains on these [gold certificate holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested matching the country’s gold reserves with Bitcoin in July.

As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,153, representing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this dip, the asset remains in a strong position overall, having posted significant gains over the past several weeks and retaining proximity to its all-time high levels. This price action follows a brief consolidation phase late last week, during which Bitcoin paused after climbing above $104,000. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently shared his interpretation of the trend based on derivatives and spot market data. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead Market Buy Volume and Funding Rates Show a Shift in Rally Behavior In his recent analysis, “Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market,” Avocado Onchain pointed to a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior around key price milestones. In previous breakout attempts, he noted that Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs was often accompanied by a sharp rise in Binance’s market buy volume and funding rates, both of which signaled overheated conditions. These conditions typically resulted in short-term corrections, as traders locked in profits and leverage unwound. However, the analyst observed that the current rebound is unfolding differently. Funding rates on Binance remain stable, and market buy volume is trending downward, which Avocado interprets as a sign of restraint rather than weakness. He argued that, unlike the sharp speculative rallies seen in prior phases, the present environment reflects cautious optimism and sustained accumulation. According to him, this more tempered recovery could be less vulnerable to abrupt pullbacks and instead support a more stable path to potential new highs. 📋 과열 없는 비트코인 반등, 건강한 강세장의 신호(Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market) 이번 시즌 비트코인 가격이 신고가를 갱신할 때마다 바이낸스 시장가 매수 거래량과 펀딩비는 크게 상승하였고, 그 후 과열로 인한 조정기간이 찾아오는 유사한… pic.twitter.com/c0JCPzgbfY — Avocado (@avocado_onchain) May 19, 2025 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Point to Continued Accumulation Avocado further emphasized that although buying activity is not surging at the same rate as in prior runs, the overall trend in market buy volume has been gradually increasing since 2023. He referred to on-chain data that shows a consistent uptrend, suggesting that longer-term investor appetite remains intact. With sentiment still recovering from recent corrections and derivatives markets appearing less overheated, he suggested the market structure is favorable for additional upward momentum in the near to mid-term.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.Backlash in the courtsThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Coinbase also has an agreement with Circle to put USDC onto its exchange.Circle filed for an IPO on April 1 with a goal to complete the process by the end of that month.

The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.Bitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe annualized one-month futures premium for Bitcoin remained close to 6% despite the retest of $102,000 support. This current level is within the 5% to 10% neutral range, which has been the norm over the past week. While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000.USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKXUSD Tether (USDT) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000.Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demandBitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow.Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart.

The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls.

If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus.

2025-05-19T17:17:19.000Z,"Bitcoin ignores Moody’s US debt downgrade, rallies back to $105K after profit-taking sell-off","Key takeaways:Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts.

This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge.

They will try to pull the price back into the triangle. If that happens, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the pair to $100,000.

Ether is now retesting the upper boundary of the flag, currently at $2,470, which is acting as immediate support. A daily candlestick close above this level could see the asset resume its uptrend toward the technical target of the bull flag at $3,720, up 50% from the current price.ETH/USD four-hour chart.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet.He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process.
