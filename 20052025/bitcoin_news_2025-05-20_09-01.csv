What Keeps SOL Price Below $170?","The post Are Investors Becoming Pessimistic About the Solana (SOL) Price Surge? What Keeps SOL Price Below $170? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Bitcoin price surged, investors quickly turned bearish and began to pile up short trades. This kept the entire market and the Solana price consolidated within a tight range. While the other tokens triggered a breakout as Bitcoin reclaimed $106,000, these short trades were liquidated, which resulted in a bullish breakout in many. However, the SOL price failed to do so, which raises some concern over the upcoming price rally. In a recent update, the SEC has delayed its decision on all the spot ETFs, including Bitwise and 21Shares. This delay could extend the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Solana-based investment products for institutional investors. Despite this, the price displayed some strength but is constantly failing to rise above the pivotal threshold. On the daily chart, the SOL price is showing a notable drop of nearly 6%, with the day’s candle closing below the average bands. This has compelled the price to begin the day’s trade within a consolidated zone, which could prevent the breakout for a while. The SOL price has reached the edge of the rising wedge and is testing the support of the pattern. If the price triggers a rebound, it may remain consolidated until it breaches above the 200-day MA. On the other hand, if the price initiates a breakdown, which is the outcome of the pattern, the quick sellers could be exhausted at once. Although this may cause a short-term pullback to the $145 and $147 range, a strong rebound could follow the trend. Therefore, the rebound that could follow may not see the 200-day MA as a major hindrance. As a result, a steep rise may begin, elevating the levels beyond $200. If the bulls manage to sustain the token above the gains, the Solana (SOL) price rally is expected to head towards upper targets in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/are-investors-becoming-pessimistic-about-the-solana-sol-price-surge-what-keeps-sol-price-below-170/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said clients would soon be able to buy Bitcoin, though the bank itself won’t hold the asset. “We’re not going to custody it,” he noted, adding only that Bitcoin will appear “in statements for clients.” No additional details were disclosed. The move marks a notable shift for the largest U.S. bank, particularly as rival Morgan Stanley already offers access to spot Bitcoin ETFs for qualifying clients. JPMorgan is expected to offer access to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to sources cited by CNBC. Until now, the bank’s exposure to crypto has been limited to futures-based products rather than direct investment options. Still, Dimon made it clear his personal stance on Bitcoin hasn’t changed. He pointed to its association with criminal use cases, including money laundering, sex trafficking, and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he was quoted as saying. You might also like: JPMorgan’s Dimon says he will allow clients to buy Bitcoin The remarks echo what he told CBS News back in January, when he said he doesn’t believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value and likened its users to smokers, acknowledging their right to own it while discouraging it personally. At the time, he insisted he wasn’t against crypto as a whole but remained firmly opposed to Bitcoin’s utility. Dimon’s skepticism dates back years. In 2021, during a Senate hearing, he called Bitcoin “worthless” and claimed its only real use case was among “criminals, drug traffickers, and tax avoiders.” In 2018, he called it a scam and even threatened to fire JPMorgan traders who dealt with it. At Davos earlier this year, after Bitcoin surged past $100,000, he dismissed it again as “the pet rock,” insisting it “does nothing.” Despite his criticism, JPMorgan has found itself increasingly involved in the decentralized space. The bank is listed as an authorized participant in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and has praised blockchain technology, even as its CEO continues to distance himself from Bitcoin specifically.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. On an optimistic note, Solana’s TVL has crossed $10.9 billion, influenced by fee growth, increased staking, and rising DeFi use cases. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 42.74% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

2025-05-20T06:21:32.000Z,"HTX DeepThink: Bullish Sentiment Builds as BTC Holds Steady—Which Altcoins Will Lead the Rotation?","As mid-May unfolds, a macro data lull offers a brief pause—but crypto market sentiment continues to rise. While major assets trend steadily upward, capital is beginning to rotate into fundamentally solid altcoins. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research shares her macro outlook and strategic insights, with a spotlight on rotation opportunities across the SUI ecosystem and the emerging AttentionFi sector. Macro Outlook: Rising Bullish Sentiment Amidst Steady Short-Term Uptrend This week’s U.S. economic calendar is light on major data releases. Market attention is primarily directed towards Federal Reserve officials’ interpretations of recent commentary suggesting a possible single interest rate cut in 2025. Analysis of options market data shows a prevailing bullish sentiment: the Call/Put open interest ratio has reached 1.55, accompanied by increasing premiums for call options. At the same time, short-term implied volatility (IV) has dropped to a new 18-month low of 35–40%. In short: the market is experiencing “euphoric sentiment amid calm volatility.” Under such conditions, Bitcoin could retest new highs within the next 30–45 days, targeting the $105K–$115K range. However, this mix of high sentiment and low volatility often conceals the build-up of excessive leverage. A sudden surge in IV or a meaningful drop below $100K could trigger a sharp deleveraging event. Strategic Positioning: Capital Rotation into High-Quality Altcoins for Momentum Capture From a capital allocation perspective, rotating a portion of capital into fundamentally strong and liquid altcoins may present an opportunity to capitalize on potential spillover momentum from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. This edition of HTX DeepThink highlights promising sectors and projects worthy of investor attention. SUI Ecosystem: All-Time High Market Cap, Undervalued Core Projec The SUI chain has reached an all-time high in market cap, but its ecosystem projects have yet to follow with substantial gains. This opens a key window for early positioning in undervalued ecosystem leaders. HTX has listed two standout projects within the SUI ecosystem: Haedal and Bluefin . Haedal is the dominant LST (liquid staking) protocol on SUI, commanding 76% of market share and benefiting from strong network effects. Bluefin , SUI’s flagship perpetual DEX, currently holds a market cap of only $31.6M yet has achieved an annualized revenue of $8.2M, implying a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 3.8x—far lower than GMX (9.1x) and Drift (12.4x). The upcoming V2 upgrade will introduce veTokenomics and new trading incentives, potentially boosting both user activity and protocol revenues. Given the rising attention on SUI’s mainnet, Haedal and Bluefin—both considered core infrastructure—appear to exhibit dual potential for valuation recovery and Beta-driven upside. These developments may warrant mid-term attention from market participants. AttentionFi: Capitalizing on Bull Market User Acquisition Premium As the current bull cycle accelerates, new Web3 projects are launching rapidly, and the cost of user acquisition is soaring. In traditional channels like Telegram, Google, or Red Note, user acquisition cost (UAC) is calculated via “traffic × conversion rate.” With CPCs at $0.5–1.0 and conversion rates around 10%, it can cost $5–10 to acquire a real, retained user. Kaito offers a far more efficient “attention engine.” Its API charges based on a combination of reputation score and meaningful engagement. As a result, project teams can acquire real users with 3–4x higher retention at just $2–3 per user—much lower than traditional channels. With this model, Kaito has grown rapidly, expanding from 30 to 120 integrated projects in the past three months, and quadrupling API call volume. Meanwhile, $KAITO staking has surged to 19.7M tokens , and the protocol has cumulatively bought back and burned 3.7M tokens , creating a strong demand-supply mismatch and deflationary pressure that supports higher price ceilings. On the Base chain’s IDO platform Virtuals , users who stake ≥5,000 $KAITO can earn Virgen Points to redeem IDO allocations. Several recent IDOs have seen 10–30x returns on day one, forming a lucrative loop: stake → points → arbitrage .However, launching a project on Kaito’s Yapper Leaderboard requires significant voting and staking budgets. Teams with limited resources can first use GiveRep to identify quality community members and reputation-based seed users at zero cost, then scale with Kaito once traction builds. GiveRep is closely aligned with the SUI Foundation and has partnered with major SUI ecosystem projects like ika and Typus , with future airdrop expectations adding further appeal. With the recent listing of $KAITO on HTX , its liquidity is expanding—and in a bull market where competition for user attention intensifies, Kaito’s combination of low-cost, high-precision targeting and deflationary tokenomics makes it a promising asset to watch. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

2025-05-20T06:11:25.000Z,"80% of Americans Want to Diversify US Gold Reserves Into Bitcoin: Survey","A recent survey by the Nakamoto Project, a nonprofit Bitcoin education and advocacy group, has revealed that four out of five Americans want some US gold reserves converted to BTC. The survey of 3,345 respondents asked: “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?” The majority of respondents wanted between 1% and 30% converted, it revealed. 4 in 5 Americans want some US gold reserves converted to bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ibxXfe04g5 — The Nakamoto Project (@NakamotoProjct) May 19, 2025 Lots of Skepticism Project co-founder Troy Cross said many were skeptical of the findings, suggesting that only Bitcoiners were surveyed. “We were also surprised too. But the results are the results. When given a slider and asked to advise the US government on the right proportion of Bitcoin and gold, subjects were very reluctant to put that slider on 0% Bitcoin and 100% gold. Instead, they settled around 10% Bitcoin,” he explained. The recommended proportions of BTC dropped significantly with age, which was not surprising given the inverse relationship the organization found in a previous survey between age and Bitcoin ownership. Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter said he didn’t believe it at first, adding that: “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most people are inclined towards diversification when given the choice.” The survey, which ran between February and mid-March, was conducted online, and participants were paid. However, the survey and data collection company Qualtrics was asked to match the US Census distribution in terms of age, gender, race, income, education, and geography as closely as possible, he added. The study also revealed that around 66% of respondents were neutral-to-positive about Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Uncle Sam also holds around 207,189 BTC worth around $22 billion, less than 3% of its gold reserves, according to BiTBO, so there is plenty of room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a new strategy that the Treasury might start buying Bitcoin using profits from its gold reserves. This plan, if enacted, could lead to the purchase of up to 1 million BTC over five years. He referenced Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, stating in March, “If we actually realize the gains on these [gold certificate holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested matching the country’s gold reserves with Bitcoin in July.

2025-05-20T06:00:58.000Z,"Bitcoin Briefly Surpasses $106K Before Pullback, Analyst Sees Stable Momentum","Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory in the early hours of Monday, briefly surpassing the $106,000 mark before encountering resistance and experiencing a minor pullback. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,153, representing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this dip, the asset remains in a strong position overall, having posted significant gains over the past several weeks and retaining proximity to its all-time high levels. This price action follows a brief consolidation phase late last week, during which Bitcoin paused after climbing above $104,000. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently shared his interpretation of the trend based on derivatives and spot market data. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead Market Buy Volume and Funding Rates Show a Shift in Rally Behavior In his recent analysis, “Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market,” Avocado Onchain pointed to a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior around key price milestones. In previous breakout attempts, he noted that Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs was often accompanied by a sharp rise in Binance’s market buy volume and funding rates, both of which signaled overheated conditions. These conditions typically resulted in short-term corrections, as traders locked in profits and leverage unwound. However, the analyst observed that the current rebound is unfolding differently. Funding rates on Binance remain stable, and market buy volume is trending downward, which Avocado interprets as a sign of restraint rather than weakness. He argued that, unlike the sharp speculative rallies seen in prior phases, the present environment reflects cautious optimism and sustained accumulation. According to him, this more tempered recovery could be less vulnerable to abrupt pullbacks and instead support a more stable path to potential new highs. 📋 과열 없는 비트코인 반등, 건강한 강세장의 신호(Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market) 이번 시즌 비트코인 가격이 신고가를 갱신할 때마다 바이낸스 시장가 매수 거래량과 펀딩비는 크게 상승하였고, 그 후 과열로 인한 조정기간이 찾아오는 유사한… pic.twitter.com/c0JCPzgbfY — Avocado (@avocado_onchain) May 19, 2025 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Point to Continued Accumulation Avocado further emphasized that although buying activity is not surging at the same rate as in prior runs, the overall trend in market buy volume has been gradually increasing since 2023. He referred to on-chain data that shows a consistent uptrend, suggesting that longer-term investor appetite remains intact. With sentiment still recovering from recent corrections and derivatives markets appearing less overheated, he suggested the market structure is favorable for additional upward momentum in the near to mid-term.

2025-05-20T05:54:19.000Z,"Genesis targets parent company DCG in dual lawsuits for over $1B in disputed transfers","Crypto lender Genesis Global Capital has filed two lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group, and CEO Barry Silbert, seeking to recover over $1 billion in allegedly improper transfers made while Genesis was insolvent. According to a May 20 report by Bloomberg Law, Genesis accuses DCG and insiders of “self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement,” claiming they funneled funds to themselves through reckless lending practices and deceptive financial disclosures. The complaint, partially redacted, seeks the return of 1 million digital assets worth approximately $2.1 billion to repay creditors. The Delaware suit alleges DCG and its affiliates, including Grayscale Investments, enriched themselves at the expense of Genesis customers by misleading the market about the lender’s financial health. In a separate lawsuit filed the same day in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Genesis seeks to claw back over $1 billion in transfers made in the year leading up to its bankruptcy in January 2023. These include $448 million to DCG, $136 million to DCG International, and $101 million to HQ Enhanced Yield Fund, among others. Genesis also wants to recover $34 million in tax-related payments it says were fraudulent.

According to reports, Genesis was already insolvent by the end of 2021 and owed $14 billion in unpaid loans. The legal team for Genesis argues that DCG insiders knew about the lender’s growing risks but did nothing about them. To protect DCG from Genesis’ financial consequences, they allegedly transferred assets internally instead. Genesis filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 2023 and completed its restructuring in August 2024, distributing roughly $4 billion in cash and crypto to creditors. That plan, which DCG opposed , included a $2.2 billion payout to Gemini Earn users and uncapped recoveries based on current asset prices. Both lawsuits seek to hold DCG responsible for its alleged involvement in Genesis’ demise and boost creditor recoveries.

2025-05-20T05:53:47.000Z,"SEC delays decision on Solana ETF applications citing market manipulation concerns","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on four proposed Solana exchange-traded funds, including filings from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary. The announcement, shared on a May 19 filing , indicates that the agency will “institute proceedings” to assess whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory standards. This procedural move allows the SEC to extend the review period and open a public comment window. The agency stressed that the institution of proceedings “does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions” on the filings. Instead, the SEC says it needs more time to examine the proposals under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, particularly provisions related to fraud prevention and investor protection. Among the delayed filings is the Bitwise Solana ( SOL ) ETF, which was first submitted in January through Cboe’s BZX Exchange. Bitwise’s fund would hold SOL directly, with prices tracked against the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. Similarly, 21Shares, already known for its spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, filed its own Solana proposal earlier this year. You might also like: 72 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC approval, from altcoins to memecoins Despite growing demand, no altcoin ETFs linked to Solana have been authorized in the U.S. to date. The SEC’s cautious approach to growing crypto-based investment products, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, is reflected in the delays. The SEC is assessing whether the proposals comply with Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), which requires that listed products be made to “protect investors and the public interest” and “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” according to the filing. The delay also comes amid a wider regulatory bottleneck for digital asset ETFs. Several filings for additional cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and XRP ( XRP ), are still being examined. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, remain hopeful. They estimate a 90% chance of approval for Solana and Litecoin ETFs by late 2025, citing favorable commodity classifications and rising institutional demand. But the future is still unclear. Investors may be left in limbo if the SEC’s request for public input causes the timeline to be further extended.

2025-05-20T05:48:15.000Z,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns of 1929-Like Market Crash as Moody’s Downgrades U.S. Credit","The post Robert Kiyosaki Warns of 1929-Like Market Crash as Moody’s Downgrades U.S. Credit appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Wall Street faced a sharp pullback on Monday, May 19, as Moody’s downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating by one notch, citing concerns over the nation’s mounting $36 trillion debt. The downgrade triggered a broad market sell-off and raised alarms about the U.S. economy’s long-term stability, but it also reignited a long-standing warning from financial author Robert Kiyosaki, who sees this as the beginning of something far deeper and more dangerous. Markets Rattle as Moody’s Slashes U.S. Credit Rating Moody’s, the last of the major rating agencies to act, cut the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing ballooning deficits and rising interest costs that threaten America’s ability to manage its debt. Investors reacted swiftly: Nasdaq-100 futures plunged 1.6%, S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, and Dow futures fell 0.8%. At the same time, bond yields surged, with the 30-year Treasury piercing the 5% mark for the first time in years, a clear sign of investor nervousness about lending to the U.S. This came on the heels of one of Wall Street’s strongest weeks in months, where easing U.S.-China tensions had sent tech stocks soaring. But those gains now appear fragile as financial markets brace for the ripple effects of America’s downgraded fiscal image. Robert Kiyosaki’s Stark Warning: ‘Deadbeat Dad’ America Author and financial educator Robert Kiyosaki responded strongly to the news. He compared the U.S. to a “deadbeat dad” borrowing recklessly with no plan to pay it back. He warned that this downgrade will likely lead to higher interest rates, triggering a recession, rising unemployment, potential bank failures, and possibly a crash reminiscent of the Great Depression of 1929 . Kiyosaki said he foresaw this scenario in his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy and has long urged people to escape the trap of job security. Instead, he advises embracing entrepreneurship, investing in cash-flowing real estate during downturns, and saving real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. “A depression can be the best time to become rich,” he wrote, encouraging people to think like entrepreneurs, not employees clinging to a steady paycheck and a shrinking 401k. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: U.S. Senate Moves GENIUS Act Forward with 66-32 Vote , It’s all Politics…. I think the main reason the markets did not react more sharply to the Moody's downgrade is that it's obvious the U.S. government will never honestly repay its debts. Default or inflation is inevitable. Credit ratings are basically irrelevant. They reflect politics, not economics. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 19, 2025 On the other side, Peter Schiff dismissed Moody’s downgrade as largely irrelevant, saying markets didn’t react strongly because it’s already clear the U.S. can’t repay its debts. He warned that default or inflation is inevitable and argued that credit ratings are political, not economic. Crisis = Opportunity With Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week, investors will be closely watching for signals on how policymakers interpret the downgrade and its potential influence on interest rate decisions. For Kiyosaki, however, the message is already clear for those who prepare wisely, with real assets and an entrepreneurial mindset, may turn crisis into opportunity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-20T05:47:34.000Z,"JPMorgan to Offer Clients Access to Bitcoin, Not Custody It: CEO Dimon","US Banking giant JPMorgan will soon let clients buy Bitcoin, the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon said Monday at the bank’s annual investor day. “We are going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it,” Dimon told investors . “We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CEO Dimon has been a Bitcoin critic , comparing the world’s largest crypto to smoking. He previously claimed that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is often misused by bad actors. During the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2024, he told CNBC that Bitcoin “does nothing,” calling it the pet rock and “hyped-up fraud.” However, on Sunday, he made it clear that his personal view on Bitcoin remains unchanged. He highlighted the crypto’s lack of ownership and issues such as its use in money laundering, terrorism and sex trafficking. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” JPMorgan CEO said. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 The development follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley, which began allowing financial advisors to pitch spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to eligible clients. JPMorgan Reportedly Plans to Offer Bitcoin ETF Access A source close to the matter told CNBC that the bank is looking for ways to provide clients access to bitcoin ETFs. JPMorgan has so far limited its crypto exposure to offering futures and not direct Bitcoin ownership. This comes at a time when there is a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the pro-crypto Trump administration. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, launched several legal battles against a string of crypto firms. The new wave of institutional adoption led by leading fintechs and banks comes as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) provided new guidance. The agency said that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they manage risks. Dimon Downplays Blockchain’s Importance In his speech, JPMorgan CEO Dimon pushed back the hype around blockchain tech, calling it less important than it is made to be. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years,” Dimon told investors. “We spend too much on it. It doesn’t matter as much as you all think.” In the past, he took a more positive view of blockchain technology , recognizing its practical uses. JPMorgan has been actively embracing the nascent tech for various projects, including its blockchain-based JPM Coin. Further, Kinexys, JPMorgan’s own blockchain platform, ran the first test transaction recently, settling a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction on Ondo Chain’s testnet.

The announcement on Monday (which emphasized plans rather than executed actions) helped push DigiAsia’s shares up 91% during regular trading to 36 cents, before pulling back 22% after hours. The stock is still down more than 50% year-to-date. The company said its board had approved a strategy to allocate up to 50% of future net profits toward BTC purchases and was “actively exploring” a capital raise of up to $100 million, according to a press release. It also plans to pursue yield-generating strategies on its bitcoin holdings, including institutional lending and staking through regulated partners. “We believe bitcoin represents a compelling long-term investment and a foundational layer for modern treasury diversification,” said Prashant Gokarn, Co-CEO of DigiAsia, in the release. The firm added that it was evaluating financing methods such as convertible notes and crypto-linked instruments to support the initiative. In an April update , DigiAsia reported $101 million in revenue for 2024, with projected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million this year.

2025-05-20T05:33:26.000Z,"XRP ETF Hopes Rise After CME Futures Go Live, SEC Decision Looms","The post XRP ETF Hopes Rise After CME Futures Go Live, SEC Decision Looms appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The recent launch of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is igniting fresh excitement across the crypto world, with analysts and the XRP community speculating that a spot ETF might soon follow. Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store and cofounder of the ETF Institute, believes this futures milestone could be the springboard XRP needs to secure an exchange-traded fund. Meanwhile Ripple vs SEC case has also struck in technical glitch creating clouds of confusion on XRP’s ETF prospects. Will XRP make it this time? Institutional Adoption Gets a Boost In a positive move, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) has added XRP to its list of official crypto products, which shows that big financial players are becoming more confident in XRP. They’ve launched XRP futures contracts, a type of investment that lets people bet on XRP’s future price without actually owning the coins. These contracts are cash-settled, so when they end, investors get paid in dollars, not XRP. This setup makes it easier and safer for big institutions, like banks and hedge funds, to get involved with XRP in a regulated way. Also, the contracts have been approved by the CFTC, a U.S. regulator, which adds trust and makes it more appealing to serious investors. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse , said this is a big moment for XRP and the broader market. He mentioned that Hidden Road, a trading firm, made the first big trade on CME, and he called it an important step in XRP’s growth . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Set to Benefit as GENIUS Act Passes Key Senate Vote on Stablecoins , XRP ETF Hopes Rise Following the futures launch, Geraci predicted that an XRP ETF could be next. His optimism isn’t unfounded. A decision on the proposed Franklin XRP Fund , a spot ETF, is due from the SEC on June 17, 2025. If approved, it would open the door for even broader investor access, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have brought in institutional capital and increased legitimacy. Adding weight to the argument is a 2023 ruling by the DC Circuit Court that criticized the SEC for denying Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF while allowing futures-based ones. The court emphasized that if a crypto asset has an active CME futures market, it’s hard to justify blocking a spot ETF. XRP now fits that profile. XRP Price Analysis Despite the positive headlines, XRP’s price has shown little movement in the short term. It’s currently down 0.77% over the past 24 hours but has seen a 63.87% spike in trading volume, signaling heightened interest. As of now, XRP trades at $2.37. While XRP trades sideways, many believe the groundwork is being laid for a bigger run, especially if the ETF dream becomes a reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-20T05:30:07.000Z,"SEC Chair Slams Agency’s Previous ‘Head-In-The-Sand’ Crypto Regulation","In a significant address aimed at revitalizing the relationship between regulators and the cryptocurrency market, new US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins outlined his vision for a more constructive regulatory environment. Trust Deficit Between SEC And Crypto Industry Speaking to capital markets on Monday, Atkins criticized the previous administration’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, which he believes has stifled innovation and left the crypto industry in a state of uncertainty. Atkins described the SEC’s past strategies as a “head-in-the-sand” approach, initially hoping that the crypto market would simply fade away. This was followed by a more aggressive “shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later” method, where market participants often found themselves facing subpoenas rather than receiving guidance. The new pro-crypto chair emphasized that this created a “Catch-22” — a difficult situation from which there is no escape — for those trying to navigate the regulatory landscape . He believes that this has led to a lack of trust between the SEC and the crypto industry. In his prepared remarks, Atkins stated, “The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years.” He underscored the need for regulators to adapt existing rules to accommodate technological advancements, arguing that the SEC should use its authority to foster innovation rather than impede it. “Old ways of doing things should not be immutable,” he also noted while advocating for flexibility in regulatory frameworks to better align with the evolving nature of the digital asset market. Plans To Draft New Digital Asset Rules Atkins also highlighted the previous SEC leadership’s failure to facilitate open communication between staff and market participants, particularly when complex legal questions arose. To address this, Atkins has directed the Division of Corporation Finance to maintain transparent interactions with the public, allowing for more nimble capital allocation and fostering a more collaborative environment. As part of his commitment to reform, Atkins announced that the SEC staff is currently drafting rule proposals related to cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, he encouraged staff to provide useful insights through informal FAQs, which, although not formal regulations, can help clarify industry concerns. One of Atkins’ proposals includes allowing SEC registrants to custody and trade both securities and non-securities under one roof, a move he believes could streamline operations and reduce costs for investors. He envisions this as a step toward creating a “super-app” that could integrate various financial services, making them more accessible. Atkins concluded his address with a promise to prioritize innovation, stating, “We are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation.” He expressed optimism about the SEC’s future direction and its potential to enhance the market for investors.

2025-05-20T05:27:07.000Z,"Experienced Analyst Makes New Price Prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) – “BTC Will Reach At Least…”","Experienced cryptocurrency analyst Fred Krueger made ambitious predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) in his statements on social media. According to Krueger, the leader BTC will reach at least double its current level within this year. Krueger also warned users who postpone entering the market, saying, “Almost everyone gets out of the game trying to time it. And many who try to find the perfect entry point never get in the game.” Krueger, who admitted that Bitcoin could be affected by fluctuations in traditional markets such as Nasdaq in the short term, argued that the “HODL (holding assets without selling)” strategy would be profitable in the long term. He stated that it may be possible to achieve better results with derivative products such as options, but that this requires serious timing sensitivity. Related News: Is This Altcoin the New Favorite of Institutional Investors After Bitcoin? They've Been Buying for Weeks! Krueger also criticized financial institutions that prefer to keep Bitcoin on their company balance sheets, arguing that this approach goes against the basic philosophy of Bitcoin: “If you really understood Bitcoin, you would own it directly. But everyone's capacity is different.” Krueger heavily criticized the banking and finance sector, making the following comparison: “These sectors are like dinosaurs now. They are no different than Blockbuster Video, Tower Records or the horse-drawn carriage industry.” At the end of his statement, he made a striking emphasis: “There are only two things you should focus on right now: Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. Everything else is unimportant.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T05:25:32.000Z,"Bitcoin Gets Nod from JPMorgan but Dimon Refuses to Custody It","This move is a major shift for Dimon, who is well known as a long-time crypto critic, and brings JPMorgan in line with competitors like Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, corporate interest in Bitcoin continues to rise as Canadian biotech firm Quantum Biopharma increased its crypto holdings to $4.5 million and plans to stake assets for additional yield. In Asia, Basel Medical also plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin. Separately, Chinese printer company Procolored is facing backlash for distributing malware-infected drivers that stole almost $1 million in Bitcoin. JPMorgan to Open Bitcoin Access to Clients Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, announced a shift in the bank’s stance toward Bitcoin. Speaking at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19, Dimon revealed that the bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, although it will not offer custody services for the cryptocurrency. Instead, JPMorgan plans to include Bitcoin holdings in client statements without directly managing or storing the asset. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” According to a CNBC report , JPMorgan intends to offer clients access to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which gained a lot of traction in the US since their launch in January of 2024. These products have already attracted close to $42 billion in aggregate inflows, indicating a strong appetite among investors. Until now, JPMorgan's crypto exposure was largely limited to futures-based products rather than direct investments in Bitcoin. Dimon’s comments also still reflected his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. He reiterated his concerns about their potential use in illicit activities like money laundering, sex trafficking, and terrorism. However, he framed his support for client access in libertarian terms: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” This marks a big turn for Dimon, who has been one of the most vocal critics of Bitcoin over the years. In 2018, he called Bitcoin a scam , and in 2021, he said it was “worthless” during the height of the crypto bull market. During a 2023 Senate hearing, he characterized cryptocurrencies as primarily serving criminals and tax evaders. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, even after Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone, Dimon dismissed it as a “pet rock” that “does nothing.” Jamie Dimon Despite his personal misgivings, JPMorgan’s decision to offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs aligns it with rivals like Morgan Stanley, which has also started offering the product to select clients. Quantum Biopharma Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Canadian biotechnology firm Quantum Biopharma also recently increased its exposure to digital assets by purchasing an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The acquisition brings the company’s total crypto holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a press release that was issued on May 19. In line with a growing trend among corporations, Quantum announced it plans to stake part of its crypto holdings to generate additional revenue. The company sees its treasury strategy as a way to deliver returns to shareholders while also providing a hedge against the volatility of the Canadian dollar. Quantum’s stock price increase over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) After the announcement, shares of Quantum’s stock surged by around 25%, according to data from Google Finance . This suggests that investors responded positively to the firm’s deeper involvement in the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly considered as a strategic financial move by companies beyond the tech and finance sectors. Quantum is part of a wave of healthcare and biotech companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Earlier in March, NASDAQ-listed Atai Life Sciences revealed plans to invest $5 million into Bitcoin. Atai founder Christian Angermayer has been a very vocal supporter of the strategy, and said in a post on X that Bitcoin should be included in every corporate treasury—particularly in the biotech industry. He argued that crypto assets can help firms endure the long and uncertain timelines that are associated with drug development by offering a buffer against inflation and potential liquidity issues. More recently, on May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of its strategy to boost expansion across Asia. Basel said that the Bitcoin reserves would help build one of the strongest balance sheets among healthcare providers in the region, although its share price fell on the news. Corporate treasuries collectively hold over $83 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Publicly traded companies now represent the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, second only to exchange-traded funds. Company Caught Distributing Bitcoin-Stealing Malware In other Bitcoin-related news, Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored is under fire after reports emerged that it distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official printer drivers. According to a May 19 article by Chinese media outlet Landian News , the Shenzhen-based company uploaded infected drivers to cloud storage platforms, making them globally accessible for download. The malware was reportedly embedded in USB drivers used for Procolored printers, which ended up compromising unsuspecting users’ systems. The security breach reportedly led to the theft of 9.3 Bitcoin, valued at over $953,000. Cybersecurity firm Slow Mist offered a breakdown of just how the malware functions in a detailed post on X , and explained that it manipulates the system clipboard to replace copied Bitcoin addresses with those belonging to the attacker. This kind of malware is particularly dangerous as it remains stealthy and can redirect funds without user awareness at the moment of transaction. The initial warning was issued by YouTuber Cameron Coward , who discovered the malware while reviewing a Procolored UV printer. His antivirus software flagged the driver as being infected with a worm and a Trojan virus identified as Foxif. After Procolored dismissed the antivirus detection as a false positive, Coward escalated the matter to Reddit . This drew the attention of cybersecurity professionals, including those at G-Data. Procolored printers After an in-depth analysis, G-Data confirmed that the Procolored drivers contained two major forms of malware: Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a sophisticated clipboard hijacker. These files, some of which had been hosted on the file-sharing platform MEGA since as early as October of 2023, were found to be capable of opening remote backdoors and executing commands from attackers. When contacted, Procolored claimed the malware was the result of a supply chain compromise. The company said infected USB devices unintentionally introduced the malicious software, which was then uploaded to their official driver distribution channel. According to the firm, the compromised files were removed on May 8 and all available drivers were re-scanned for safety.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9184/bitcoin-gets-nod-from-jp-morgan-but-dimon-refuses-to-custody-it,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-20T05:20:39.000Z,"XRP Set to Benefit as GENIUS Act Passes Key Senate Vote on Stablecoins","The post XRP Set to Benefit as GENIUS Act Passes Key Senate Vote on Stablecoins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A major crypto bill—the GENIUS Act just passed a key procedural vote on May 19, and now it’s heading toward full Senate approval, possibly as soon as May 20. If this stablecoin bill becomes law, crypto won’t just stabilize, it could explode. Big projects like XRP and Bitcoin might rise fast, while weaker ones could disappear. This bill isn’t just about rules. It could reset the whole crypto space. Why the GENIUS Act Is a Big Deal The GENIUS Act sets strict rules for stablecoins in the U.S. It first failed to pass the Senate on May 8 due to concerns about weak user protections and Trump’s influence. But things changed by May 19. After adding stronger rules, the bill passed a key vote with 66-32 support. Meanwhile, the updated bill requires stablecoins to have full 1:1 fiat backing, monthly audits, and clear redemption rules. This will help remove shady or risky coins and make stablecoins safer for both regular users to billion-dollar institutions. What Comes Next? House of Representatives – The bill moves to the House , where debate could focus on Trump’s coin, DeFi rules, and consumer protection. Reconciliation (if needed) – If the House edits the bill, both chambers must agree on a final version. Trump’s Signature – Trump is expected to sign it, especially since he supports stablecoin rules and backs USD1. Implementation – Includes 100% reserve backing, monthly audits, Fed/OCC oversight, and stricter rules for stablecoin issuers over $50B. XRP’s Secret Advantage in This Bill Stablecoins are a key part of the crypto world. While XRP is not a stablecoin, it could benefit a lot from stronger stablecoin rules. XRP is mainly used for cross-border payments, which need fast and smooth money transfers. Trusted stablecoins make these transactions easier and more reliable. So, the more stablecoins we have and the safer they are, the more useful XRP becomes for global banks and payments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-set-to-benefit-as-genius-act-passes-key-senate-vote-on-stablecoins/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","News",cryptocompare

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

With XRP charging forward and bullish sentiment rising, traders are identifying a shortlist of altcoins gaining steam. At the top of that list: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Cardano , and Bitcoin — three names building pressure for a potential eruption as we move deeper into 2025. XRP: Futures Launch Fueling the Rally Toward $50 XRP is now trading around $2.36 , with the launch of CME XRP futures scheduled for May 19 . The move is being treated as a milestone moment, giving XRP mainstream exposure through a regulated futures market. Analysts are calling for a rally toward $4–$5.50 in the short term, with extended targets of $10–$50 over the cycle if institutional capital and ETF approval follow.

Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Upgrade Buzz Cardano is holding above $0.75 , with strong whale accumulation in recent weeks. Over 80 million ADA was bought by large holders in just 48 hours, with speculation building around the Midnight airdrop and upcoming Leios upgrade . Many analysts expect ADA to move toward $1.20–$1.50 if it breaks through the key $0.80 resistance. Bitcoin (BTC): Cycle Leader Holding Firm Over $105K Bitcoin is stabilizing above $105,000 , with volume surging and open interest on CME futures climbing. The $250K price target remains on the table for many institutional models, and analysts are calling BTC’s current strength the foundation for a broader altcoin breakout. As Bitcoin holds, rotation into higher-upside coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and ADA is accelerating . Solana and ATOM: Quiet Accumulation Could Flip Fast Solana is gaining strength above $178, with real ecosystem expansion through Metamask and Chainlink Labs integration. ATOM, meanwhile, is showing signs of accumulation around $4.73 despite forecasts of near-term volatility. If the next leg of altseason catches fire, both tokens are positioned to follow — but neither is moving as fast as MAGACOIN FINANCE right now.

2025-05-20T05:00:12.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Fate May Be Sealed On June 9, Analyst Warns","Bitcoin spent the European trading hours changing hands near $103,000 after Sunday night’s failed attempt to clear $107,100. The pull-back has done little to dent the conviction of market technician Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX), who argues that the decisive battleground is still three weeks away: the weekly close of 9 June, when the Tenkan-sen is projected to cross above the Kijun-sen on the Ichimoku chart. What This Means For Bitcoin Price In a post on X published on May 19, the analyst reminded followers that “some people don’t understand the concept of time-frames,” adding that “while now we have a clear rejection with volume, a lot of people decided to get scared … on the first red 4h candle which even if red, didn’t break support.” He framed the current setback as routine consolidation: “Since tomorrow ~99.9K is a super-strong support,” he wrote, identifying the high-liquidity pocket between $98,900 and $100,200 as an area that is “most likely” to be “bought up pretty quickly and decisively” should spot bids be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10,000 Stairway: Chart Signals March Toward $115,000 The crux of Dr Cat’s argument lies in the interaction of the fast-moving Tenkan-sen and the medium-term Kijun-sen on the weekly chart. An upward cross of the former above the latter—sometimes colloquially dubbed a “TK golden cross”—carries weight among Ichimoku practitioners because it signals that near-term momentum has finally overwhelmed the baseline trend. What makes the 9 June close especially delicate is the tightness of the current range. Dr Cat concedes that “it’s unclear which will come first, $99,000 or $109,000—and that doesn’t really matter,” but he is categorical that “any deeper retrace below $98,000 is very unlikely.” The rising Kijun-sen, itself a 26-period mid-point, has in effect ratcheted support higher with every week of sideways trade. Related Reading: Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000 Macro-sensitive traders will also be working around the publication of the May US Consumer Price Index on June 11—two days after the anticipated TK cross—and the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting meeting on June 17-18. With real-yield expectations still dominating risk-asset positioning, any upside surprise in core inflation could delay the confirmation of bullish chart patterns—or intensify them if the data land dovish. For now, the market remains range-bound. As long as $99,000 holds on a closing basis and the Chikou-span (lagging line) stays above price, Dr Cat sees little reason to abandon an all-time-high thesis. “If by the time of the cross the price is still holding above Tenkan Sen … if ATH is not seen by then, it should be seen pretty much immediately,” he wrote. Whether that confidence will survive the macro calendar is another question. What is clear is that both discretionary traders and systematic funds are marking 9 June as the moment the chart either validates the 2025 bull cycle—or postpones it once more. At press time, BTC traded at $103,721.

The largest crypto by value displays a strong performance, and savvy investors are looking for ways to leverage its growth.

Bitcoin Pepe has raised close to $10.5 million, with its presale selling out faster before its 31 May official listing. This article explores how BPEP prepares to ride Bitcoin’s wave in the upcoming months and years. Bitcoin ETFs attract $40B in inflows Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed incredibly since their much-awaited approval in early 2024 . The latest statistics show that investment products have officially surpassed $40 billion in inflows as of 19 May, 2025. That reflects massive demand from institutional investors, revealing their trust in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What do such trends mean for retail players? The crypto market is maturing at an unprecedented pace. And altcoins, especially those with unique narratives like BPEP, tend to outperform amid Bitcoin’s rise. Bitcoin Pepe rides on BTC’s wave as listing approaches Meme tokens have dominated during bull cycles, and Bitcoin Pepe is leading the pack this time. BPEP plans to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential by unleashing trillions in dormant capital into the themed-tokens space. The project grabbed attention due to its one-of-a-kind approach, introducing the world’s first meme initial coin offering (ICO) on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, BPEP is witnessing soaring interest with increased accumulation before the 31 May debut. The project has raised $10,434,818, and looks ready to hit its presale target in the next eleven days. Source – Bitcoin Pepe Its listing appears to be timing as Bitcoin targets record all-time highs amidst institutional interest and positive sentiments. Speculations that Bitcoin Pepe could launch in leading centralized exchanges (CEXs), including OKX and Bybit, after 31 May have magnified the frenzy. Though without official confirmations, experts trust the post-launch craze will attract trading platforms that look to match prevailing trends. Such developments will potentially alleviate BPEP’s status in the meme token and broader crypto space.

Source: CompaniesMarketCap While the bellwether crypto aims to surpass Amazon’s $2.188 trillion and Apple’s $3.118 trillion, meme tokens linked to the Bitcoin ecosystem appear on steroids. Bitcoin Pepe , which looks to transform the BTC blockchain with increased earning opportunities for investors, rallies as it gains traction before its May 31 official launch. The new project has raised over $10.43 million, confirming investor confidence in its future potential. With timing proving paramount in the digital assets world, let’s evaluate BPEP’s potential in the upcoming months, especially as Bitcoin hints at long-term rallies. Bitcoin steadies above the $2 trillion mark The largest crypto by value first hit the $2 trillion milestone in late 2024. However, dwindling sentiments in Q1 2025 saw the metric plunge to around $1.5 trillion. However, Bitcoin reclaimed $2 trillion in early May as developments like the US-China trade deal revived risk-on appetite. Bitcoin trades at $105,757, with $2.109 trillion in market capitalization cementing its position in the top ten assets by value globally. Presuming the top five maintain constant market sizes, Bitcoin should hit $110,000 to overcome Amazon. Moreover, a new ATH above $158,000 is essential to flip Apple. That seems possible as analysts expect Bitcoin to hit the $200,000 landmark before the end of 2025.

That’s where BPEP comes in. The meme token combines two iconic symbols: the viral Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin. While themed tokens like DOGE and SHIB rely on social media hype and community enthusiasm, Bitcoin Pepe will leverage BTC’s robustness and security for heightened investor benefits. It plans to crack Bitcoin’s full potential through Solana-like functionalities, including staking, meme trading, NFTs, and DeFi activities. The more than $10 million raised in the ongoing presale indicates a positive response from crypto investors looking for long-term growth and utility. Who would want to miss this one-of-a-kind opportunity? Remember, BPEP introduced the world’s first ICO on Bitcoin. There are only eleven days left to board the train. What to anticipate as BPEP’s May 31 debut approaches? The altcoin will likely witness increased activity as its official listing nears. While adopters can experience heightened volatility, Bitcoin Pepe seems poised for key developments that could enrich its visibility. First and foremost, insiders hint at potential listing by top trading platforms, including Bybit and OKX. That will attract increased demand as more traders and investors access the token. Moreover, BPEP’s uniqueness could draw influencer buzz, amplifying attention to the digital token.

2025-05-20T04:39:40.000Z,"Bitcoin Surges Past $107K Before Sharp Pullback as $138M in Futures Liquidated","Bitcoin (BTC) went through a roller coaster of price action today, which took it past the $107,000 mark, only to pull back sharply to settle near $105,220. The rapid swings in price triggered a liquidation event in the futures market, with over $138 million in long and short positions vaporized in just a few hours. The session highlights the fact that Bitcoin is still very much tied to its liquidity and hit-you-in-the-face resistance levels, like, for instance, the one it just on the other side of $12,000. And when sentiment dips below key liquidity thresholds, you know what happens, don’t you? You can feel it in your bones. Futures Market Rocked by $138M in Liquidations As per the information provided by Coinglass, the rally and the following retracement of Bitcoin today caused a major disturbance within the derivatives market. Positions worth a total of $138 million were wiped clean, and the ones that got hit the hardest were the short sellers. Of the total liquidations: Traders betting against Bitcoin were forced out of their positions during the unexpected surge past $107K, and as a result, shorts accounted for $94.42 million. Liquidations totaled $43.77 million for long positions, thanks to the brief drop in Bitcoin’s price after it reached an intraday high. A market ruled by leveraged trades and momentum-driven strategies dominates a rapid-lubrication pace. What we see in crypto trading is not too different from what we might expect during a fire sale in a very illiquid stock or bond. While events of this sort are not too unusual in the crypto space, the sheer size and swiftness of today’s downsizing serves to remind us of the inherent risks in trading under such conditions. Key Price Levels and Supply Clusters Come Into Focus Bitcoin’s intraday high fell short of a critical resistance level at $106.6K, which has become a significant supply zone, stopping just short of a key resistance level at $106.6K, which has emerged as a significant supply zone. On-chain data indicates that approximately 31,000 BTC were picked up at or near this price point on December 16, 2024, and that a large concentration of unspent coins now exist with this cost basis. #BTC 's price surge stalled just below $106.6K – a level with 31K $BTC held at that cost basis. This supply cluster originated on Dec 16 and remains unshaken. Holders haven’t redistributed, nor averaged down – making $106.6K an important level to watch in the short term. pic.twitter.com/f7rXqtP6qD — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 The particular significance of this level is that these coins have not been redistributed or averaged down since their acquisition. The holders of this large tranche have remained inactive, which may signal either strong resolve or strategic patience. As a result, $106.6K is now being closely watched as a critical short-term barrier. A decisive break above could signal renewed bullish momentum, while repeated rejections may spark deeper corrections. The unwillingness of this group to shift their assets indicates that a sizable number of market players are treating the current pricing level as a decision point. They’re either waiting for confirmation of a breakout before fully committing or getting ready to go the other way if we get rejected at this level. Correlation with Gold Drops Sharply in Short Term Bitcoin’s short-term relationship with gold has turned negative, to put it mildly. Over the last month, the correlation between the two assets plunged to -0.54, the lowest level seen since February 2022. This negative movement suggests that gold and Bitcoin are not telling the same story any longer. If anything, it implies that Bitcoin’s current narrative is more about “crypto stuff” and less about the traditional safe-haven narrative that gold has habitually followed. Still, the partial correlations over the medium and long terms stay in place. The 90-day correlation is 0.39, and the 365-day correlation is a sturdy 0.60. It indicates that, when looked at over the horizon of a year, the price of Bitcoin still to a material extent tracks the price of gold. #Bitcoin 's short-term correlation to gold has dropped to -0.54 over the past 30 days – the lowest since February. Meanwhile, 90D and 365D correlations remain positive at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively. pic.twitter.com/GDoN8DwQfA — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 In the short term, this divergence could stem from heightened speculation and leverage within cryptocurrency markets. Distinct narratives, whether they be related to ETF inflows, technological advancements, or digital assets’ unique geopolitical context, might also be playing a role. Looking Ahead: Volatility and Resistance Ahead With BTC around $105,220, the traders and investors who follow it are anticipating that increased volatility is on the way in the next few days. The main level of resistance BTC is looking to bust through is $106.6K. There are a couple of reasons why this level is tough for BTC to get past, but if it does get past it, there isn’t a lot holding it back from going to new all-time highs. Conversely, if Bitcoin cannot keep the uptick intact, it could slide back toward the $103K level — a price it grazed earlier in the day. The potential for a downturn seems to have market participants on edge, watching for any sign from futures, on-chain indicators, or the broader macro environment that could give them a handle on where things are headed in the immediate term. At present, Bitcoin remains a prime example of unpredictability—a state of being that carries equal parts risk and reward. As it transitions from one stage of its 2025 crypto cycle into another, this much is clear: It is still the most talked-about cryptocurrency. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet, Bitcoin has continued to gain institutional and governmental support, and it seems Bukele’s early and audacious investments have proven prescient. As of March 2024, his Bitcoin portfolio has grown to 117 percent, for an impressive total profit of $326 million. In value and in leadership, Bukele is now positioned as a forward-thinking figure in the global crypto landscape, with his approach toward Bitcoin finally beginning to pay dividends. The narrative of Bukele underscores how, once seen as vague or niche, cryptocurrency is gaining respect as a solid means of finance that has a shot at long-term growth. His bet on Bitcoin might have looked like a gamble in the past, but today it seems more and more like a windfall that is pushing El Salvador into the digital asset arena with not just private players, but also an increasing number of government actors. Nayib Bukele's Bitcoin Portfolio Since March 2024, Nayib Bukele’s $BTC portfolio has been in the green, currently showing a profit of 117%, which translates to $326 million in dollar terms. As institutional players and even nation-states increasingly embrace crypto,… pic.twitter.com/3lAWn0cppC — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 19, 2025 MicroStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Purchase and Growing Holdings Although Bukele’s portfolio has generated a lot of interest, he’s not the only one going all-in on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm led by Michael Saylor, absolutely has to be part of the conversation when discussing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Last week, the company made yet another gigantic purchase, acquiring 7,390 BTC at a total cost of about $764.85 million, which works out to an average individual price of $103,498. This most recent acquisition has expanded MicroStrategy’s total holdings to an astonishing 576,230 BTC, with a present-day worth of around $59.33 billion. The average purchase price now registered by the company is $69,726, and this figure translates into a paper profit of about $19.15 billion. In Bitcoin and its holdings, MicroStrategy has placed a very public bet—and one that it seems to be doubling down on. Besides holding Bitcoin directly, MicroStrategy has developed a nice sideline as one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin investors. It has not only invested in Bitcoin but has incrementally increased that position over time. Right now, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments are worth about $8.3 billion, give or take. Institutional Adoption Continues to Surge: Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Metaplanet’s Expansion The institutional interest in Bitcoin is not confined to single firms. Instead, it is rapidly becoming an all-encompassing occurrence, one whose vigorous embrace by the mainstream financial community is underscored by the unbroken string of five weeks during which spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows. Those inflows have totaled $604 million for the week of May 12 to May 16, 2023, alone. The periodization of those inflows marks affinity adoption for spot Bitcoin ETFs by the investment community, yet another signal that the financial establishment has Bitcoin on its radar. In the past trading week (May 12 to May 16, ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net weekly inflow of $604 million, marking five consecutive weeks of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net inflow of $41.59 million for the week, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading the pack with $66.04… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 19, 2025 In addition, Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, has ramped up its Bitcoin acquisitions as well, purchasing a total of 1,004 BTC for $104.8 million, at an average price of $104,427. With this latest buy, Metaplanet now holds 7,800 BTC in total, across all of its trades, which are collectively worth $802 million as of now, with an average purchase price of $93,225. This firm holds over a billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoin. If that’s not a serious corporate signal that institutional players are diversifying into the digital asset space, then I don’t know what is. An inflow of institutions along with a wider acceptance of Bitcoin are what we believe to be the two main ingredients for making the cryptocurrency more bullish. If you take a look at not only the traditional financial institutions but also at some really forward-thinking entities like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, all of them are now Bitcoin advocates. Their inflows into a yet-to-materialize Bitcoin ETF are making the story of Bitcoin pay off even more. Metaplanet( @Metaplanet_JP ) bought another 1,004 $BTC ($104.8M) at $104,427. Metaplanet currently holds 7,800 $BTC ($802M), with an average buying price of $93,225. https://t.co/LRlXDOEoNK pic.twitter.com/6M9ST7uHu0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 19, 2025 A Shift Toward Global Cryptocurrency Adoption What began as an audacious, experimental step by Bukele to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador has now morphed into something much larger: the trend of institutions and governments embracing cryptocurrency. With heavy hitters like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet investing gobs of cash into Bitcoin and adding it to their balance sheets, it’s become a lot clearer that the world of finance is coming around to the idea of Bitcoin—and by extension, other cryptocurrencies—being integrated into our “normal” financial systems. This change is also reflected in the burgeoning success of Bitcoin ETFs, which are giving traditional investors a more secure and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset directly. The inflows into these products suggest that the financial mainstream no longer considers Bitcoin a niche asset. Under Bukele’s Bitcoin held, continued performing spectacularly, and his leadership in a country that wasn’t even a blip on the global map a year ago has begun to gain recognition. His decision to embrace Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that some skeptics say will ultimately be replaced by the digital dollar, may ultimately be viewed as a pioneering move. He is doing what the foundational fathers of Bitcoin envisioned: leading a country to make the cryptocurrency more available to the citizenry. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-20T04:25:36.000Z,"Ethereum exchange supply drops to 10-year low amid strong whale accumulation — is $3000 ETH price incoming?","Ethereum’s supply on centralized exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in over 10 years, as large holders and institutions continue to accumulate the asset. According to a May 19 update by Santiment, less than 4.9% of Ethereum’s ( ETH ) total supply is now held on exchanges, a record low in the network’s 10+ year history. Santiment noted that over the last five years, 15.3 million ETH have been withdrawn from centralized trading platforms. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1924555052473061859?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw More recently, CryptoRank.io reported on May 18 that over 1 million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past month alone. The platform noted that “users are increasingly choosing to accumulate Ethereum rather than trade it,” pointing to long-term confidence in the asset. On-chain data shows that Ethereum whales, wallets holding over 10,000 ETH, have added more than 450,000 ETH since late April. By May 10, these large holders owned 40.75 million ETH, the highest level since March, as tracked by Santiment. You might also like: Ethereum price dips as a whale capitulates with a big loss Institutions are also showing growing interest. According to SoSoValue data , U.S. spot ETH spot ETFs have seen net inflows of $30 million in the last month, reversing a prolonged streak of outflows. At the same time, BlackRock’s Ethereum assets under management have surpassed $2.9 billion, signaling continued accumulation. Analysts say ETH is becoming a key asset for institutional investors. In a May 12 post on X, market analyst Adriano Feria wrote: “ETH remains the most natural choice for institutional diversification… It’s the only crypto asset with ETF access, regulatory clarity, and built-in yield potential.” Ethereum has also benefited from recent network upgrades. The Pectra upgrade , which went live on May 7, improved how Ethereum handles data. This has helped boost activity on Layer-2 networks built on Ethereum. According to L2Beat data , Base led the way with 259 million transactions in the past 30 days, and overall Layer-2 activity is up over 20% compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, the market is watching a possible Securities and Exchange Commission decision by June 1 on whether to allow staking for spot ETH ETFs. If approved, institutions could earn yield through these funds, which may attract more capital. BlackRock and other firms have argued that staking would make Ethereum ETFs more complete. According to some analysts, Ethereum may outperform Solana ( SOL ) and other tokens this bull cycle.

2025-05-20T04:25:32.000Z,"XRP Futures Go Live on CME: Hidden Road Clears First Block Trade","The post XRP Futures Go Live on CME: Hidden Road Clears First Block Trade appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP just hit a milestone—regulated futures are now live on the CME, one of the world’s largest exchanges. This is the first regulated XRP futures contract in the U.S and could be a game-changer for XRP’s price, boosting the chances of an XRP ETF approval in the near future. A Win for Institutions? The regulated futures for XRP and Micro XRP will allow traders to bet on XRP’s price without owning it. CME already offers futures for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, plus options for Bitcoin and Ethereum. CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on this development, calling it a “key institutional milestone for XRP”. He added that as soon as CME trading for XRP futures began, the first large trade (block trade) was successfully processed by Hidden Road, a financial firm that acts as a clearing partner. The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP…and very excited to report that Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME at the opening! https://t.co/Njj8AUSY5K — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 The futures reached over $15.6 million in trading volume by 9:20 PM UTC. CME saw 120 standard contracts trade at around $2.40 each, totaling about $14.3 million (each contract equals 50,000 XRP). Besides, 206 micro contracts (2,500 XRP each) added $1.2 million in volume. CME Group’s Giovanni Vicioso explained that the rising interest in XRP and its ledger (XRPL) from both institutions and retail traders has driven the launch of new futures contracts. These contracts offer investors efficient tools to support their trading and risk management strategies. Could an ETF Be Next? Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store , said that since CME-traded XRP futures are now live, spot XRP ETFs are just a matter of time and could arrive soon. Bitcoin price surged when Bitcoin launched on the CME futures market but quickly crashed. A similar reaction was expected for XRP, an initial price spike followed by a correction. However, XRP has remained muted to the announcement until now. Nevertheless, XRP bulls are optimistic over the new futures trading that could bring in institutional money, boost volume, and price stability. XRP is currently trading around $2.38, with bulls eyeing a return to $3, a level not seen since 2018. However, analyst Ali Martinez warned that XRP could return to $2 if it loses the critical $2.30 support level. It is still facing pressure from its unsettled lawsuit that is yet to be finalised. Any positive developments in the case could improve the chances of an XRP ETF approval shortly.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-futures-go-live-on-cme-hidden-road-clears-first-block-trade/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

This pushed total inflows for the year to $7.5 billion, eclipsing the previous high of $7.2 billion seen in February. The influx has now erased the $7 billion in outflows from the February-March downturn. Interestingly, Ethereum stood out with strong performance. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Ethereum experienced $205 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $575 million. This was indicative of a renewed investor confidence after the Pectra upgrade finally went live on May 7th, following a series of delays, as well as the appointment of co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak. Bitcoin also saw notable inflows of $557 million, though down from the previous week, possibly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish stance. Meanwhile, short-bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million for the fourth consecutive week, which suggested investor hedging as prices climb. During the same period, Sui and XRP recorded inflows of $9.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink posted smaller inflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million. On the other hand, Solana witnessed $0.89 million in outflows, and multi-asset products saw a larger $2.9 million in withdrawals. Regional investor sentiment showed clear divisions. The US, for one, saw strong weekly inflows of $681 million, with Germany and Hong Kong contributing $86.3 million and $24.2 million, marking Hong Kong’s largest since November 2024. Australia and Switzerland followed with modest inflows of $13.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.comFrom an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $153 and, after that, to the 50-day SMA ($143). That points to a possible range-bound action between $180 and $120 in the near term.The bulls will have to propel the price above the $185 level to regain control. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally to $210 and subsequently to $220. Related: XRP price risks falling to $2 after classic bearish chart pattern confirmsDogecoin price predictionBuyers successfully defended the breakout level of $0.21 on May 17 but are struggling to sustain the bounce in Dogecoin (DOGE).DOGE/USDT daily chart.

That signals a possible range formation between $0.26 and $0.14.Buyers will have to thrust the price above the $0.26 resistance to signal the resumption of the recovery. There is minor resistance at $0.30, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then ascend to $0.35.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) has broken below the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain. This trend was further corroborated by a recent Cointelegraph report, which documented the growing monetary value secured by DeFi lending protocols. The crypto lending market has rebounded sharply from its 2022 lows but remains well below the peak from 2021.

Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly.

2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

2025-05-19T05:42:26.000Z,"‘Sats’ vs ‘bits’ debate reignites amid proposal to change Bitcoin base unit","A recent proposal that aims to change Bitcoin’s base unit to make it easier to understand as a payment tool has run into opposition, with critics saying Bitcoin’s satoshis are no more confusing than the dollar’s cents. Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course.However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness.The new rule is part of the UK’s integration of the Organisation for Economic Development’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting.The changes reflect the UK government’s aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection.Related: Bitwise lists four crypto ETPs on London Stock ExchangeUK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud.“Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time.A study from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021.UK’s approach contrasts with EU’s MiCAThe UK’s move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union’s approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year.According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register.There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU’s approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.Source: MiCA Crypto AllianceMagazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-to-mandate-crypto-reporting-on-all-customer-transactions-in-2026?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
