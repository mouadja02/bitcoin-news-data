The price action pattern can be summarized into three different conditions: Range lows and range highs led to immediate trend reversal. A double bottom occurred after range highs ($97,900 and $107,144) were formed. The double bottom formation occurred above range lows, sweeping internal liquidity levels, but the bottom.

If this pattern holds, it could increase the chances of Bitcoin breaking above $107,000, potentially reaching new highs above $110,000 this week. Conversely, a failure to hold $103,500 could lead to a retest of the $102,000 support. This would be treated as an invalidation of the price fractal, which could open the possibility of new lows under $102,000 in the coming days.

The Bitcoin market stands to significantly benefit from the improved trade-war negotiations. Bitcoin (BTC) price experienced significant volatility in the past two days after breaking out of a symmetrical triangular pattern on Sunday. The flagship coin established a support level around $102,229 on Monday, and rebounded over 3 percent to trade above $105,370 on Monday, May 19, during the late North American trading session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), rallied in tandem, thus resulting in nearly $600 million crypto-leveraged liquidations during the last 24 hours. Major Forces Behind Today’s Bitcoin Rebound JPMorgan’s Bitcoin Entry On Monday, JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon said that the bank will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin but will not participate in the custody services. Notably, JPMorgam manages more than $4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), which is likely to flow into the Bitcoin market, either directly or through the spot ETF market in the near future. The entry of JPMorgan’s clients into the Bitcoin market is a major milestone in the mainstream adoption of BTC by institutional investors. Furthermore, Dimon has been a huge skeptic of Bitcoin as a digital gold in the past but the pressure from investors has led the bank to bow down to Bitcoin.

The malware, linked from Procolored’s own support site, swapped copied Bitcoin addresses to redirect funds to attackers, netting around 9.3 BTC. After public exposure, Procolored’s parent company, Tiansheng, removed the infected files, blaming the breach on USB cross-contamination. Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored has been found distributing malware through its official printer drivers, exposing users to serious cybersecurity risks. The malicious software, which included a remote access trojan and a cryptocurrency stealer, appears to have been embedded in Procolored’s companion software for at least six months. Procolored, based in Shenzhen, China, specializes in digital printing solutions such as DTF, UV, and DTG printers. Since its founding in 2018, the company has expanded rapidly, selling in over 30 countries, including the U.S., where it has a big customer base. Malware Found in Procolored Printer Software, Impacting Users Globally According to local news media , the issue came to light when YouTuber Cameron Coward , known as Serial Hobbyism, detected malware on his system after installing drivers for a $7,000 Procolored UV printer. His antivirus flagged a worm known as Floxif. Coward initially contacted the company, which denied any wrongdoing and claimed the alert was a false positive. “If I try to download the files from their website or unzip the files on the USB drive they gave me, my computer immediately quarantines them,” Coward said. Seeking clarity, Coward turned to Reddit for help . That led to a deeper investigation by Karsten Hahn, a researcher at cybersecurity firm G Data. Hahn confirmed the presence of two pieces of malware: XRedRAT, a remote access trojan capable of keystroke logging and remote control, and SnipVex, a previously unknown clipboard hijacker targeting Bitcoin addresses. The malware was traced to at least six Procolored printer models, with infected files hosted on Mega, linked directly from Procolored’s official support site. A total of 39 compromised files were found. The malware replaced copied Bitcoin wallet addresses with ones controlled by attackers, stealing funds from unsuspecting users. A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 has been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post : “The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program.

The firm responded that it had removed the affected drivers and rescanned all files as of May 8, 2025. The company claimed the infection likely occurred during USB transfers between systems before the files were uploaded online. Users are now urged to scan their systems thoroughly. Experts recommend a full system reinstall for anyone who has used the infected drivers. New, clean driver files are reportedly available but must be requested directly from Tiansheng’s technical support. Chinese Marketplaces and US Fronts Fuel Southeast Asian Fraud Rings The discovery of Bitcoin-stealing malware in Procolored’s official printer drivers comes amid a wider wave of cybercrime infrastructure originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia. On May 18, blockchain firm Elliptic linked a Colorado-incorporated entity to a Chinese-language Telegram marketplace called Xinbi Guarantee, a platform used to facilitate large-scale crypto scams. Source: Elliptic Xinbi has processed over $8.4 billion in stablecoin transactions, primarily USDT, since its inception. The platform offers illicit services ranging from money laundering and fake IDs to tech hardware and stolen personal data. It operates on a “guarantee” model, requiring vendor deposits to maintain trust among criminals. Xinbi was registered in the U.S. in 2022 under the name Xinbi Co. Ltd. The company was flagged as delinquent in early 2025 for failing to file reports. Elliptic suggests the group’s crypto activity may also be tied to North Korean hackers. Xinbi follows Huione Guarantee, another Chinese marketplace exposed in 2024 for facilitating $98 billion in transactions . These networks reveal a growing underground economy powered by stablecoins and an alarming rise in cyber fraud.

Circle is seeking at least $5 billion, which is its target for the IPO, according to the four banking and private equity sources Fortune cited. Ripple tried to purchase Circle on April 30, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low . If Ripple or Coinbase were to buy Circle, the details of a purchase would differ. Ripple would pay using cash and XRP ( XRP ), a cryptocurrency that Ripple created. Coinbase, on the other hand, would use cash and stock. Coinbase and Circle have a relationship dating to 2018, when they launched the Centre Consortium. That venture was meant to establish standards for fiat-backed stablecoins, including USDC. Coinbase also has an agreement with Circle to put USDC onto its exchange. Circle filed for an IPO on April 1 with a goal to complete the process by the end of that month.

This decision comes even though the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been openly doubtful about cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, the bank is responding to growing demand from its clients. JPMorgan Chase Takes A Careful Approach to Bitcoin During a recent Investor Day event, CEO Jamie Dimon confirmed that JPMorgan customers will soon be able to buy Bitcoin directly through the bank’s platform. However, the bank will not be providing custody services. This means the bank will not hold the flagship cryptocurrency for any clients. It is taking this approach to offer crypto exposure while avoiding asset management risks. Although financial institutions are careful about crypto, they are exploring the blockchain technology behind it. During the event, it was revealed that JPMorgan has completed its first public blockchain transaction involving tokenized government bonds. The bank partnered with blockchain companies such as Chainlink and Ondo Finance on this deal. Notably, other big institutions have followed a similar path. Goldman Sachs, which once questioned the future of crypto, is now offering crypto trading services to its clients. It allows wealthy individuals and institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum-related products and invest in blockchain technology and digital asset infrastructure. JPMorgan Chase Meets Crypto Growing Interest In 2025, many investors and companies have shown more interest in cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy recently bought 7,390 Bitcoin, adding to its large Bitcoin holding. The company is currently facing legal questions about its crypto plans. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price remains firm, trading around $105,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. JPMorgan’s new Bitcoin offering fits this more significant trend. It shows that the bank is willing to serve clients who want to invest in digital assets, even as it remains cautious about how it gets involved. CEO Jamie Dimon’s Ongoing Doubts Even with JPMorgan opening doors to Bitcoin, CEO Jamie Dimon has not softened his personal views on the cryptocurrency. In January 2024, he called Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and questioned its value. He said he would never buy Bitcoin himself. Dimon also clarified that he respects people’s choice to buy the coin, even if he does not personally support it. This shows that while the bank responds to customer demand, its leader remains doubtful about Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.

2025-05-19T21:17:08.000Z,"BIP-177 Earthquake in Bitcoin (BTC): If the Vote Passes, Much Will Change – Here’s the Proposal","A new proposal has been making waves in the Bitcoin community: BIP-177. This proposal proposes to redefine the basic unit of Bitcoin, with the smallest unit known as “satoshi” or “sat” in the current system being called “1 Bitcoin.” The Proposal Removes the Concept of Satoshi: 1 BTC Will Be Equal to 100 Million Bitcoins In this case, 1 BTC will be equal to 100 million Bitcoins; that is, 1 sat today will now be considered 1 Bitcoin. The current BTC code will not change. The main idea behind the proposal is to make Bitcoin easier for users to understand and to provide a representation that is more in line with the nature of the Bitcoin protocol. The BIP-177 document published on Github draws attention with the following statements: “This BIP proposes to use the base unit as the standard unit of measurement by eliminating synthetic decimal places. This will make it easier for users to understand Bitcoin, reduce confusion, and directly match the on-chain values on the screen display.” Proponents of the proposal say that the current system’s eight decimal places (e.g. 0.00000001 BTC = 1 satoshi) are confusing, as the Bitcoin blockchain actually stores these values as countable whole units, not decimals. The current system simply prefers decimal representations for user experience. Related News: Surprise Altcoin Sees All-Time High in Number of Active Addresses This Month Twitter (X) founder Jack Dorsey also joined these discussions. Dorsey shared on X by simply writing “BIP-177.” This short but meaningful support attracted attention in the community. If the proposal is accepted, the smallest unit we know today as “1 satoshi” will be called “1 Bitcoin”. The value we currently call “1 Bitcoin” will be equal to 100 million Bitcoins. There will be no change in the technical infrastructure; the only changes will be in the user interface and unit naming. While some Bitcoin users believe that this proposal will help better explain Bitcoin to the public, others argue that it will increase confusion and that changing terms that have been used for years is unnecessary. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T21:00:16.000Z,"Pundit Says XRP Price Will Stabilize At $1,000 And Become ‘Very Expensive’","Despite its current lackluster price action, many crypto analysts have agreed through various analyses over the past few years that XRP has a very bright parabolic rally ahead. This sentiment has particularly gained ground due to its price action in Q4 2024, leading to a multi-year high of $3.34 in January 2025. Although XRP has retraced quite a bit from this high, this hasn’t stopped bold long-term projections from resurfacing. One of the more striking forecasts comes from a crypto analyst who believes the altcoin will not only rally into double digits soon but eventually stabilize at $1,000 and become one of the most expensive digital assets in the world. Analyst Predicts The Altcoin Will Hit $10 To $20 Before Entering New Bear Market Crypto market commentator BarriC shared a post on social media platform X outlining a future price trajectory for XRP that begins with a major surge in the coming months. BarriC’s post begins by criticizing the perception that the current price range, which remains below $3, reflects failure. Instead, he views this phase as an accumulation opportunity before a massive breakout. Related Reading: $10,000 XRP Theory: Factors Analyst Shares Scenarios That Could Drive Growth According to the analyst, there’s a high possibility that the XRP price will climb to somewhere between $10 and $20 in the next few months. Such a move would undoubtedly be accompanied by a surge in the trading volume and activity surrounding XRP. One such primer is if the cryptocurrency somehow gains full utility and adoption with banks in the next few months, or through the launch of a Spot XRP ETF. This surge, BarriC noted, would likely coincide with the final stages of the current altcoin season. Following that, he expects a significant market correction, similar to past cycles, which would bring XRP back down to the $5 to $10 range. Previous cycles dating back to 2016 have typically ended with a sharp 50% market dip. If this happens again, the lower boundary for the next cycle could land between $5 and $10. This mid-cycle dip, according to BarriC, will be the last time XRP is considered cheap before it enters a fundamentally different phase. Banks And Institutional Adoption To Tie Up XRP At $1,000 Permanently BarriC’s prediction is ultimately based on banks’ mass institutional adoption of XRP. He noted that when the asset becomes deeply integrated into the daily operations of banks and financial institutions, we will see a $1,000 XRP. Once trillions of dollars begin flowing consistently through the XRP Ledger, there will be no more volatility and bear market phases for its price. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It’s Headed For $1,000 – Analyst Reveals At that point, BarriC believes the altcoin will stabilize at a $1,000 valuation, not as a temporary peak but as a structural price floor.

XRP has been steadily declining from $2.62 in the past seven days.

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Yields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects. The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings. To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China. Periods of excessive optimism usually lead to stablecoins trading above fair value, which is not a healthy indicator, as Bitcoin jumps above $105,000. USDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY. Source: OKX USD Tether ( USDT ) has been trading at a slight 0.4% discount in China, meaning Bitcoin’s price increase has likely not been driven by FOMO. The absence of excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures and the lack of desperate inflows into Chinese markets are key ingredients for sustainable price gains, paving the way for a more solid bullish momentum above $105,000. Bitcoin shrugs off bad news, holds support amid strong spot demand Bitcoin’s price displayed significant resilience after the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against Strategy’s top executives, claiming “false and/or misleading statements” regarding risks associated with Bitcoin’s investment. The complaint specifically mentions unrealized losses, although those events do not affect the company’s cash flow. Regardless of whether the case has foundation, negative headlines tend to have a much stronger and longer price impact in neutral to bearish markets, which clearly was not the case as Strategy (MSTR) shares traded up 2.4% on May 19. Additionally, the fact that the $102,000 support held amid increased global economic uncertainty, combined with strong spot buying and resilient derivatives metrics, provides every indication that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further price gains.

2025-05-19T20:38:17.000Z,"Australian crypto holders may be due billions in refunds in landmark tax case","A recent ruling by an Australian court could change how cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are taxed, which could result in billions of dollars in refunds to crypto investors across the country. The landmark judgment came when the Judge handling the criminal case involving stolen Bitcoin declared that the cryptocurrency should be treated as another form of money, raising serious questions about the legality of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) taxation of crypto gains. A Bitcoin theft case with major tax implications The case involved the criminal trial of William Wheatley, a former Australian Federal Police officer (AFP), who in 2019 allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoins during a drug investigation. At the time, the stolen Bitcoin was worth around AUD 730,000. Today, that same stash is valued at over AUD 20 million (USD 13 million), highlighting just how much Bitcoin has appreciated. But it wasn’t the theft that raised eyebrows in the crypto and legal communities; it was Victorian magistrate Michael O’Connell’s interpretation of what Bitcoin actually is. In delivering the ruling, the judge referred to Bitcoin as property of a similar nature to the Australian dollar (AUD) rather than a speculative asset, such as a foreign currency, shares, or gold, which is how the ATO currently treats it for taxation purposes. Wheatley’s defence team is basing its argument on the claim that Bitcoin is information, a credit entry in a ledger in software, and not a property, meaning it can’t be stolen. Challenging the ATO’s capital gains framework The ATO currently classifies cryptocurrencies as assets, meaning that any time they are sold, exchanged, or even used to purchase goods and services, the holders who deal with the digital assets are expected to calculate and pay capital gains tax. However, if Bitcoin is legally considered a currency like the AUD, as the judge suggested, then those gains could fall outside of the ATO’s capital gains tax regime. While the judge didn’t explicitly speak on its tax implications, it can be subject to varying interpretations. This has led analysts to say that the case could potentially go to the Australian High Courts for further conclusion on what the ruling means for the tax body, and if Bitcoin can be considered a property. According to legal professionals , this new interpretation of Bitcoin, if upheld in the higher courts, could force a complete rethink of the tax treatment of crypto in Australia . It could even open the door for retrospective claims, with investors potentially eligible to reclaim taxes paid on past crypto transactions, amounting to billions of dollars. The judgment makes a case for theft, and Wheatley has appealed against the judge’s decision to consider Bitcoin as property. The ATO and crypto holders have conflicting interests The implications for the ATO and over 1.9 million taxpayers who have a crypto asset account with an Australian crypto asset exchange aren’t clear yet. The ATO has also said that it doesn’t have data on the exact amount that has been paid as tax on Bitcoin transactions, as it bundles it with other income and CGT reporting. This may add an extra strain to potential refunds should the case go on to require the ATO to make refunds. However, while there may be some form of optimism in the camp of crypto holders, legal commentators warn that the ruling doesn’t automatically change the law. It will take either a definitive legal challenge or new legislation to codify Bitcoin’s status as money and determine its tax treatment.

Rising accumulation of Bitcoin by institutional investors signals high crypto confidence amid anticipated crypto summer. At JPMorgan Chase’s annual investor day on Monday, May 19, CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank’s clients can finally buy Bitcoin (BTC). Dimon said that the bank will only allow investors to purchase Bitcoin but the bank will not offer custody services. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” Dimon said. The move to allow investors to purchase Bitcoins follows an improved regulatory outlook amid notable capital flight from institutional investors. Meanwhile, Dimon expressed concerns about the U.S. economy, highlighting the likelihood of a recession despite the cool-down tariff wars. Nevertheless, Kalshi now estimates a 38 percent chance that the United States will experience a recession in 2025. Crypto Market Rebounds on Short-squeeze Following the announcement by JPMorgan’s CEO, Bitcoin price rebounded over 2 percent to trade about $105,503 on Monday, May 19, during the mid-North American session. The wider altcoin market followed in tandem led by Ethereum price, which surged over 5 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,518 at the time of this writing. Consequently, nearly $600 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, mostly involving short traders. The notable forced liquidation of short positions in the past 24 hours increased the fuel of a short squeeze in the wider crypto market amid bullish sentiment. What Next? The improving tariff trade negotiations amid rising demand for digital assets by institutional investors has set the precedent for a parabolic phase in the near future. A crypto summer, often characterized by sustained optimism and rising asset prices, is anticipated to happen in the coming few months. Moreover, institutional investors – led by Strategy and Metaplanet – have continued to aggressively accumulate more Bitcoins in the recent past. According to market data from CoinShares, digital assets recorded a net cash inflow of about $785 million last week, thus posting the fifth consecutive week of inflows.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/jamie-dimon-says-jpmorgan-investors-can-buy-bitcoin-crypto-rebounds-after-nearly-600m-rekt/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T20:32:47.000Z,"Ripple Takes The Lead In Circle Acquisition Battle, Bidding Between $9-11 Billion","Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has taken significant steps toward an initial public offering (IPO). However, recent reports suggest that the IPO may face uncertainty as the company engages in informal discussions about a potential sale to either Coinbase Global or Ripple. Circle Would Sell To Coinbase ‘In A Heartbeat’ According to sources familiar with the negotiations who spoke with Fortune, Circle is looking for a valuation of at least $5 billion, the same sum it is aiming for its IPO. A banker engaged in the discussions said that if Coinbase made a genuine offer, Circle would likely take it swiftly, highlighting the two businesses’ close relationship. “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a heartbeat,” the source noted. Another executive remarked that the situation is fluid, with developments occurring on a weekly basis. Despite the ongoing talks, Circle remains committed to its IPO plans. The firm has yet to finalize the terms for the offering or launch its roadshow. Notably, both Circle and Coinbase have a history together; they co-founded the Centre Consortium in 2018, which is responsible for issuing USDC. As part of their partnership, Coinbase acquired an equity stake in Circle when the venture concluded in 2023, while Circle took full governance of USDC. The financial arrangement between Circle and Coinbase has been mutually beneficial, with both companies sharing revenue generated from USDC’s reserves. According to Circle’s S-1 filing, the agreement stipulates that each party receives 50% of the residual revenue from the reserves. However, Coinbase retains 100% of the revenue when USDC is held on its platform, a situation that has likely become more prevalent as Coinbase’s earnings reports indicate increased income from this partnership. Expert Claims Ripple Has Advantage Ripple, on the other hand, has also expressed interest in acquiring Circle, reportedly offering between $4 billion and $5 billion for the company. This bid was rejected as being too low, according to a Bitcoinist report . Any potential offer from Ripple would likely involve a combination of its native cryptocurrency, XRP, and cash, leveraging Ripple’s substantial balance sheet, which includes billions of dollars worth of XRP. In contrast, Coinbase could finance an acquisition using cash and stock, as it had approximately $8 billion in cash as of March 31, 2025. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has acknowledged the company’s openness to mergers and acquisitions but emphasized the importance of successful integration following a purchase. However, according to market expert Paul Barron’s update on the matter on social media site X (formerly Twitter) this Monday, Ripple has an advantage in acquiring the stablecoin powerhouse, with a potential price tag of $9 to $11 billion. XRP , on the other hand, is trading at $2.38, up 14% on the month. Year-to-date, the altcoin has outperformed the top ten largest cryptocurrencies on the market, with a 367% increase.

The S&P 500, coming off a five-day winning streak, rose slightly, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.01%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, with support from a rebound in UnitedHealth Group shares. Moody’s late Friday downgraded U.S. debt to AA1, citing “persistent, large fiscal deficits” and higher interest costs. The move came as the House Budget Committee approved a tax-and-spending plan from President Trump that would extend cuts and boost spending, raising deficit projections. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly spiked to 4.56%, its highest level in over a month, before pulling back to 4.46%. Yields on 30-year Treasurys touched 5% before settling near 4.95%. The dollar index fell 0.7%, while gold jumped 1.5% to $3,235 an ounce. Tech stocks, which led recent gains, traded mixed. Tesla dropped 2% following last week’s 17% rally. Apple slipped 1.5%, while Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta also declined. Microsoft and Amazon edged higher.

In a new press release, authorities allege that the unnamed Wellington man participated in a scheme that fraudulently obtained the crypto assets by manipulating victims between March and August 2024. The U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged the individual with racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Twelve other people are facing charges in connection with the case, including individuals from Auckland and California. According to prosecutors, the defendants laundered the proceeds of the scheme through various cryptocurrency exchanges before spending the funds to purchase luxury items such as handbags, clothes, cars, watches, private security, rental homes and expensive nightclub entertainment. The other members of the group were recently arrested and charged by the DOJ as well. According to previous reports, the organization had a team behind them made up of hackers, callers, organizers, money launderers and residential burglars. The team has been operating as early as October 2023. Last year, two members of the group, Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano, were arrested and charged in connection with a plot that allegedly saw them steal $230 million in crypto from a victim and then attempt to launder the funds using advanced methods.

2025-05-19T19:55:29.000Z,"Michael Saylor Hit With Class Action Lawsuit for Allegedly Violating Securities Laws and Issuing False and Misleading Statements","An international law firm is bringing a class action lawsuit against Strategy – formerly MicroStrategy – and its founder, Michael Saylor. According to a new press release , Pomerantz LLP is announcing a class action lawsuit against the Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury firm. Pomerantz says the lawsuit is on behalf of anyone who acquired Strategy securities between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025, and alleges that Strategy made “materially false and misleading statements” about its profitability by omitting critical information from its disclosures. Says the press release: “The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated; (ii) the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility and the magnitude of losses Strategy could recognize on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08 were understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.” According to the announcement, Strategy disclosed an unrealized loss of $5.91 billion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month after adopting updated accounting methods this year, after previously using a different model. Following the SEC filing, Strategy warned investors that they might not “regain profitability in future periods.” According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Strategy has 568,840 BTC worth over $59.8 billion, and announced another large purchase of coins on the same day the lawsuit was launched.

While JPMorgan will not custody the top crypto, the move signals a shift in how the bank deals with the asset. JPMorgan Clients Will Soon Be Able To Buy Bitcoin Speaking at JPMorgan’s annual Investor Day on Monday, Jamie Dimon revealed that the bank he runs will now allow clients to purchase BTC. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon told shareholders, though he added JPMorgan will not provide custody services for the asset. Dimon previously stated that JPMorgan was “probably one of the biggest users of blockchain,” but on Monday, he dismissed the hype around blockchain, asserting it’s less important than people make it out to be. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years,” he opined. “We spend too much on it. It doesn’t matter as much as you all think.” It’s worth mentioning that JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments platform recently settled a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction on a public blockchain, in collaboration with Ondo Finance and Chainlink. Dimon Still Isn’t A Fan Of Bitcoin Over the years, Dimon has maintained that Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value”. In 2017, he even threatened to fire any employee found trading the apex crypto, describing the act as “stupid.” He doubled down on Monday that he is still not a fan of Bitcoin because of its use for illicit activities like sex trafficking and money laundering. Earlier this year, Dimon and other banking bosses spoke about their struggles with crypto amid criticism that the U.S. government has restricted what they can do in the burgeoning sector. However, the pro-crypto Trump administration has triggered a change of heart for many in legacy finance. Goldman Sachs, for instance, recently mentioned crypto in its annual report for the first time and hinted that the Wall Street giant could participate in crypto if US regulations shift. Notably, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that banks can serve crypto clients as long as they can handle the risk.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/despite-being-a-longtime-bitcoin-critic-jamie-dimon-says-his-bank-will-now-let-clients-buy-btc/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|ONDO","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T19:32:57.000Z,"Pro-Bitcoin Senator Cancels Meeting With Ripple CEO. Garlinghouse Responds","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called out U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis for canceling a meeting and refusing to reschedule. Lummis, known for her pro-Bitcoin stance and role as Chair of the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, has been a vocal figure in crypto legislation. However, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment over her decision, emphasizing the need for inclusive leadership across the broader digital asset industry. Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation around stablecoins and market structure, and I’m very encouraged to see our elected officials look at crypto as it should be – a multichain industry. That said, @SenLummis , as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee,… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Push for Sensible Crypto Regulation Garlinghouse announced traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for “sensible pro-crypto legislation” focused on stablecoins and market structure. While optimistic about other elected leaders who see the crypto industry as a multi-chain space, his comments suggest that Lummis’ refusal to meet with him contradicted the responsibilities of a national leader. Some maximalists see Lummis’ actions as support for Bitcoin, with one commenter calling Bitcoin the only asset that matters, with others suggesting that Lummis shares their maximalist views. However, Garlinghouse’s statement shows that he maintains his inclusive stance and wants to advance the market. “As a leader in Congress and Senator from one of the most crypto-friendly states,” he wrote, “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto.” Garlinghouse has consistently pushed for inclusivity in the crypto space, and while Bitcoin maximalists were calling for a Bitcoin-only national crypto reserve, Garlinghouse suggested a multi-asset reserve to include top U.S. cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s Stablecoin Initiative and Broader Crypto Goals Ripple has been active in shaping the U.S. regulatory framework for digital assets, and Garlinghouse has consistently positioned the company as a key stakeholder in that process. The meeting with Senator Lummis was expected to support that mission, particularly as Ripple expands its influence through its new stablecoin initiative, RLUSD. Launched in December 2024 , RLUSD represents Ripple’s strategic entry into the stablecoin market. Ripple has stressed the importance of regulation and transparency, and the long-running XRP lawsuit and the negative effects it had on the asset show the importance of sensible regulation. Ripple has big plans for RLUSD as Garlinghouse previously revealed plans to make it one of the top five stablecoins by the end of 2025, and sensible crypto legislation is crucial in achieving that goal. Despite Lummis’ actions, Garlinghouse is optimistic and called on the Senator to join him on an X space or any live event to discuss ways to advance the entire crypto space and not just Bitcoin, and help achieve Donald Trump’s goal of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

2025-05-19T19:30:08.000Z,"Cardano (ADA) Founder Responds to Allegations of Stealing $600 Million Worth of ADA","Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson has categorically denied allegations that $600 million worth of ADA (approximately $318 million ADA) was misappropriated. Hoskinson announced that he will publish a comprehensive audit report regarding the transfer made during the 2021 Allegra hard fork that was at the center of the controversy. NFT artist Masato Alexander claimed that Hoskinson unilaterally used “genesis” keys to manipulate the Cardano ledger in 2021 and took control of 318 million ADA. Alexander compared the incident to Ethereum’s DAO hack in 2016, saying, “The Ethereum community did a hard fork for a $60 million hack; here, there is a $619 million intervention.” Responding to the allegations, Hoskinson said, “Input Output Global never allocated 350 million ADAs. This is a complete lie.” He stated that the majority of the ADAs in question were claimed by the original recipients over a seven-year period, while the rest was donated to an organization called Intersect. Related News: Why Did the Rally in Ethereum Stop? Expert Analyst Predicts the Future of Bitcoin and ETH in the Coming Days Hoskinson made the following statement in his statement: “No matter how many times people lie, the truth remains the same. The vast majority of those 350 million ADAs were reclaimed by their original owners within seven years. The rest were donated to Intersect after the legal deadline.” Hoskinson stated that the events deeply affected him and that he was disappointed that some people in the Cardano community did not trust him: “In a crisis, you quickly learn who your real friends are and who your just ‘good-weather friends’ are. The fact that some people treated me this way without providing any proof showed me that the bond between us was not as strong as I thought. This really upset me.” Hoskinson also announced that he plans to hand over his social media accounts to a media team and change the format of his regular AMA (Ask Me Anything) posts and X (formerly Twitter) interactions following the release of the audit report. Charles Hoskinson concluded his remarks by stating that he will still be present at events and will not give up on one-on-one contact with the community. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T19:28:32.000Z,"JPMorgan to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, CEO Jamie Dimon says","On Monday, during the company’s investor day event, CEO Jamie Dimon said that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy Bitcoin. However, he said the bank will not provide custody services for the asset. The bank’s approach underscores a broader trend among traditional financial institutions to accommodate client demand for digital assets while maintaining a cautious stance on direct involvement. JPMorgan balances client interest with its risk management strategies by enabling Bitcoin purchases without providing custody services. JPMorgan is among the American banks that have been accused of debanking in the last three years. However, the policies that were unfair to the crypto industry were revoked. These include “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the decision to drop the controversial accounting rule SAB 121. Although the bank is still not treating crypto like other traditional assets by offering custody, the finance sector looks more open to blockchain technology. Jamie Dimon says he still doesn’t like BTC After the announcement, Dimon clarified that he is not a fan of Bitcoin. However, by allowing Bitcoin into the bank, it tells how much has changed since 2017. Back then, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” said it was like the tulip bubble, and said it would burst. He went as far as saying that he would fire any JPMorgan worker caught dealing with it. In 2024, he said that he would no longer discuss Bitcoin publicly. He also said that Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value” and is heavily used by criminals involved in sex trafficking, money laundering, and ransomware activities. However, although he said all this, JPMorgan has stayed involved in the crypto market by letting its wealth management clients buy Bitcoin. The bank is also a registered participant in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Recently, JPMorgan Chase completed its first structured trade on a public blockchain. The company had only worked in private, permissioned networks for institutional clients for years. The testnet deal was done with the help of Ondo Finance (a leader in tokenizing real-world assets) and Chainlink (the top cross-chain oracle network). Both companies provided infrastructure, and Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain division, ran it. Meanwhile, investors are reacting on all social media, saying Dimon contradicts himself by saying he doesn’t like BTC but will allow his clients to buy. Bitcoin rally is on During the Asian trade session on May 19, the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply by 4%. It fell from an “important level,” as Glassnode put it. The platform for analyzing data showed that Bitcoin’s rise stopped just below $106,600, a key mark where 31,000 BTC are held. Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: Glassnode Also, after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and US Treasury yields went up, investors became more interested in risky assets like Bitcoin. However, the macroeconomic pressures got stronger and influenced the drop. Meanwhile, Strategy (MSTR) bought 7,390 BTC for about $764.9 million at $103,498 per Bitcoin on average. With this new purchase, the company now has a total of 576,230 BTC in Bitcoin, worth about $60 billion at the current market price of $105,000 per Bitcoin. The average price at which Strategy bought all of its bitcoins is now $69,726.

2025-05-19T19:27:03.000Z,"JPMorgan’s Dimon says he will allow clients to buy Bitcoin","Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan, has said that the bank will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic who has previously labelled Bitcoin ( BTC ) as worthless, now says the bank’s customers can buy the benchmark digital asset. Dimon announced the move during a speech at the banking giant’s annual investor day on May 19, 2025. However, while JPMorgan bids to join other leading banks and financial institutions, including Morgan Stanley, in bringing BTC to their clients, Dimon remains skeptical. He also noted that while JPMorgan will allow its customers to buy Bitcoin, the bank will not custody it. On his personal view about Bitcoin, Dimon has said: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” After calling Bitcoin worthless in 2021, Dimon reiterated the take during a Senate hearing in 2023 and again in 2024 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Earlier this year, Dimon likened Bitcoin to a “fraud.” You might also like: JPMorgan’s Dimon says he will now ‘defend your right to buy Bitcoin’ In his remarks about crypto and the ecosystem to lawmakers, the JPMorgan chief said he has always been “opposed to crypto, Bitcoin.” He noted that the only true use case of cryptocurrencies remains by criminals, money laundering, and tax evasion. He has previously said he would shut Bitcoin down if it was all down to him. “If I was the government, I’d close it down,” he noted in remarks in December 2023. While Dimon has maintained a negative view of BTC and crypto, the broader banking ecosysem has increasingly warmed up to it. Banks such as Morgan Stanley have shown greater ambition in tapping into the crypto market for their clients . This has come as the launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds continues to shine a spotlight on institutional demand. Also taking a more upward trajectory is the tokenized assets market, with players such as BlackRock key cogs. Notable shifts in regulatory approach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, banking regulators and others are also pushing crypto into widespread adoption across the globe.

2025-05-19T19:25:23.000Z,"Strategy Sued Over Misleading Profit Claims in $59B Treasury Bet","Strategy, a major Bitcoin-focused intelligence firm led by Michael Saylor, is now facing serious legal trouble. A group of investors has filed a class action lawsuit against the company. The plaintiffs accuse Strategy of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its large Bitcoin holdings . The lawsuit covers events that took place between April 2024 and April 2025. Investors Claim Strategy Hid the Real Risk The lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia targets Strategy and its top executives. It names explicitly co-founder Michael Saylor, CEO Phong Le, and CFO Andrew Kang. Investor Anas Hamza, represented by the law firm Pomerantz LLP, is leading the lawsuit. The class action alleged that Strategy presented an overly optimistic view of its financial health while concealing key risks. According to the complaint, the software intelligence firm gave investors the impression that its Bitcoin -focused strategy would be highly profitable. However, the company allegedly downplayed the risk of the coin’s sharp price swings. When Bitcoin’s value dropped, investors say they suffered major losses. Strategy’s Shift in Accounting Raised New Questions In early 2025, Strategy started using a new accounting rule called ASU 2023-08 in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This rule demands that companies show both gains and losses in the value of their crypto, based on market prices each quarter. Before adopting this rule, the Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy only reported losses when Bitcoin dropped, but did not show gains unless it sold the Bitcoin. After implementing this change, Strategy began showing big profits and strong Bitcoin results. Now, investors are arguing that the reports were misleading. They believe the company did not clearly explain the risks or possible losses associated with the new rule. Strategy Responds to Lawsuits, Stock Price Jump Strategy replied to the lawsuit in a public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company said it plans to fight the claims, but it cannot predict the case’s outcome yet. Strategy currently holds 576,230 Bitcoins, worth over $59 billion. The company bought those coins at an average price of $69,726 each, spending about $40.2 billion. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading at about $104,000, showing strong growth. Experts believe the digital asset will go even higher, saying it is still in the acceleration phase. Even with the lawsuit in the news, Strategy’s stock (MSTR) went up by 1.8% as of Monday. Investors and the crypto community are waiting to see what happens next.

However, he added that it will not keep it in custody. Dimon is allowing the clients to buy the cryptocurrency despite his reservations against the asset. Why JPMorgan CEO is against Bitcoin Dimon is critical of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, pointing out that his personal opinion on them remains unchanged. The investment bank’s CEO compared buying bitcoin to smoking, saying, “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke.” “Our clients are adults. They disagree. If they want to have access to buy or sell bitcoin – we can’t custody it – but we can give them legitimate, as clean as possible access.” Dimon added. Jamie Dimon had called cryptocurrencies “ worthless ” during the 2021 bull run. In a 2023 Senate hearing, he said that he was always against cryptocurrencies. In that hearing, he said cryptocurrencies were used by criminals, drug traffickers, and were used in money laundering and tax avoidance. Speaking at the 2024 Economic Forum in Davos, he said, “Bitcoin does nothing. I call it the pet rock.” Changing Stances JPMorgan’s opening to bitcoin is the latest among banks and governments’ embrace of the digital asset. Until now, the bank had only allowed owning crypto futures. Morgan Stanley, in August 2024, had allowed its employees to pitch bitcoin exchange-traded funds to interested clients. Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley’s CEO said in January 2025 that the bank will be working with the US regulators to increase its involvement in cryptocurrency markets. Under the previous US administration led by former US President Joe Biden, banks were not allowed to own physical bitcoin. The exposure was limited to bitcoin derivatives. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued multiple crypto entities like Coinbase and Kraken. However, the current President Donald Trump’s administration is more accommodating towards digital assets. Under the new laws, banks can now custody crypto, though they still have restrictions on working with crypto firms directly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Currency Comptroller’s Office have removed their anti-crypto guidance. The SEC also agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kraken. The US SEC chair, Paul Atkins , said in May that the regulator is looking to establish rules for crypto token distribution. Atkins said he is also considering changing rules that registered brokers with alternative trading system can facilitate trading in bitcoin or ether. Various US states introduced crypto reserve bills, with Texas being the first among them . Bitcoin outpaces equity markets Bitcoin in 2025 has given a 12% return, outperforming the S&P 500 index which was only up 1.47%. Bitcoin has seen inflows worth $7.21 billion in the year so far, amassing up to $147.9 billion assets under management.

This strategy appears to have paid off, as the country now holds a massive trove of unrealized gains worth over $357 million, driven by Bitcoin’s recent rally as the cryptocurrency inches closer to breaking its previously established all-time high. El Salvador’s BTC Treasure Trove President Nayib Bukele shared a screenshot on X that revealed that El Salvador’s BTC portfolio, which is now worth more than $644 million, was built on an initial investment of $287.1 million. As such, this has translated into over 124% profit margin. Despite ongoing scrutiny from global financial institutions, El Salvador has remained firm in its BTC accumulation strategy. Bukele, who led the move to legalize Bitcoin in 2021 as a means of boosting financial inclusion, has consistently dismissed external pressure to roll back the program. According to the data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, the Central American country’s holdings of 6,181 BTC position it as the sixth-largest sovereign BTC holder across the world, with the US topping the list, followed by China, the UK, Ukraine, and Bhutan, respectively. Bitcoin Bet Marches On Despite IMF Constraints Last December, El Salvador agreed to scale back its Bitcoin-focused policies as part of a financing arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. The package , which includes a $1.4 billion loan and is expected to total over $3.5 billion, came with conditions that aimed to reduce crypto activity in the country. The IMF had previously warned of possible risks tied to El Salvador’s BTC holdings. Complying with the deal, lawmakers approved reforms in January of this year, such as making Bitcoin acceptance optional for businesses rather than mandatory. However, Bukele made it clear that the cryptocurrency remains a central part of his vision. In a post on X, the country’s President insisted that the buying strategy will continue despite international agreements while asserting that El Salvador stood firm even when it was globally criticized and largely abandoned by the broader crypto community.

The allegations, first raised by Masato Alexander, an NFT creator, claim Charles used a “genesis key” during the 2021 Allegra hard fork to manipulate ADA token flows. But according to a statement from Charles on Monday, the Cardano Foundation is preparing an official audit report to address the issue directly. Masato had pointed to a specific transaction dated October 24, 2021, known as Move Instantaneous Rewards (MIR), showing 318 million ADA moved from reserves into staking or treasury pools. The transaction was flagged on Cardanoscan, fueling suspicion that the funds were quietly redirected. Critics believe the action wasn’t authorized or transparent, raising questions about how Cardano handles unclaimed or dormant ADA. Audit underway as Charles Hoskinson pushes back Responding to the backlash on May 6, Charles said the claims were false and misleading. He explained that ADA redemptions remained open for another three years after the MIR transaction. He added that the “vast majority of that 350 million ADA was redeemed by the original buyers,” and the whole redemption process stretched across seven years. Charles wrote on X, “IOG never gave itself 350 million unclaimed ADA. This is a lie. The vast majority was claimed, and the remaining that was forfeited after seven years of waiting was donated to Intersect.” Intersect is the decentralized governance body tied to Cardano’s development. While some users welcomed the explanation, others demanded independent verification. On May 18, Charles said he’s “deeply hurt” by the mistrust and plans to step back from running his X account, possibly handing it off to a media team. He also said he’ll change how he runs AMAs and X spaces moving forward. Charles confirmed that an audit report tied to the Allegra hard fork is being prepared and will be released soon. In an X post from April after the Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Charles said : “Cardano has a huge stockpile of Ada in its treasury, annual inflows, and is in a hypercompetitive industry. We’ve always known that 2025 would be an interim budget year to get us to a regular annual process. We shouldn’t expect perfection nor squeeze the people who have been building our ecosystem for years. I want Cardano to win. No one outside of the Cardanoverse cares about this stuff.

2025-05-19T18:56:45.000Z,"Market Expert Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $220,000 By Year End If This Happens","Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to show strength following a resilient recovery from its April lows. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $104,921. Notably, after dipping below $80,000 amid heightened U.S.-China tariff tensions, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, gaining approximately 25% in April alone before a further surge this month. Renewed institutional interest has bolstered this upward momentum, including significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. That said, in this bullish environment, market analyst “apsk32” has projected that Bitcoin could reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 if its historical correlation with gold remains intact. In a recent tweet , the pundit argued that Bitcoin’s price movements continue to reflect long-term patterns tied to gold, not fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which he claims distorts BTC’s real value due to inflation. “The peg to fiat hides the truth,” he stated, citing a valuation model that prices Bitcoin in ounces of gold rather than dollars. The model uses a power-law function, a mathematical formula that accounts for Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. According to the analyst, Bitcoin currently represents over 643 million ounces of gold in market capitalization. This relationship, he suggested, puts the digital asset on track to match or exceed $220,000 in the coming months, assuming gold’s rally continues and Bitcoin maintains its historical pattern of lagging gold’s movements by a few months. Notably, Gold recently reached a record price of $3,500 per ounce, forming what the analyst describes as a “very bright” backdrop for Bitcoin. Although a theoretical top of $444,000 is possible based on this model, the analyst noted he believes $220,000 is a more realistic ceiling for 2025. But the journey to that target is not without obstacles. Market data shows a significant liquidity barrier between $105,000 and $110,000, where large sell orders could suppress upward momentum. Key support is seen at around $98,000 to $100,000, a level some analysts call “critical” for sustaining the uptrend. Elsewhere, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and founder of MN Trading, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin needs to hold above $98,000 to continue its bullish momentum. “ It’s the last major consolidation before the breakout, ” he said. Meanwhile, other prominent voices have weighed in with similar bullish predictions. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , doubled down on his support for Bitcoin, calling it a hedge against a collapsing central banking system. “ I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250K this year. Buy more. Do not sell ,” he urged his followers on Saturday However, not all indicators point to a smooth ride. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s short-term correlation to gold has recently dropped to -0.54, its lowest since February, implying that in the short run, BTC and gold are currently moving in opposite directions. Still, long-term correlations remain intact, with 90-day and 365-day values at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/market-expert-predicts-bitcoin-to-hit-220000-by-year-end-if-this-happens/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Markets|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin BTC notched a strong rebound after slipping to as low as $102,000 early in the U.S. session, following its record weekly close at $106,600 overnight. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap climbed back to $105,000 in afternoon trading, up 0.4% over 24 hours. Ether ETH rose 1.2%, reclaiming the $2,500 level. DeFi lending platform Aave AAVE outperformed most large-cap altcoins, while the majority of the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index members still remained in the red despite advancing from their daily lows. Solana SOL, Avalanche AVAX and Polkadot DOT were down 2%-3%. The bounce extended to U.S. stocks, too, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq erasing their morning decline. The early pullback in crypto and stocks came after Moody’s late Friday downgraded the U.S. credit rating from its AAA status. The move rattled bond markets, pushing 30-year Treasury yields above 5% and the 10-year note to over 4.5%. Still, some analysts downplayed the downgrade's long-term impact on asset prices. \""What does [the downgrade] mean for markets? Longer-term – really nothing,\"" said Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida Wealth. He added that in the short term there might be some selling pressure centered on U.S. Treasuries due to large institutional investors rebalancing, as some of them are mandated to hold assets only in AAA-rated securities. \""Moody’s is the last of the three major rating agencies to downgrade U.S. debt. This was the opposite of a surprise – it was a long time coming,\"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in an X post. \""That’s why stock investors don’t seem to care.\"" Bitcoin targets $138K this year While BTC hovers just below its January record prices, digital asset ETF issuer 21Shares sees more upside for this year. \""Bitcoin is on the verge of a breakout,\"" research strategist Matt Mena wrote in a Monday report . He argued that BTC's current rally is driven not by retail mania, but by a confluence of structural forces, including institutional inflows, a historic supply crunch and improving macro conditions that suggests a more durable and mature path to fresh all-time highs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have consistently absorbed more BTC than is mined daily, tightening supply while major institutions, corporations such as Strategy and newcomer Twenty One Capital accumulate and even states explore creating strategic reserves. These factors combined could lift BTC to $138,500 this year, Mena forecasted, translating to a roughly 35% rally for the largest crypto.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/19/bitcoin-climbs-to-105k-crypto-etf-issuer-sees-35-upside,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|21Shares|Ram ahluwalia|News",cryptocompare

Investors allege the company made “materially false and misleading statements” about its profitability. Plaintiff Anas Hamza and other investors filed the lawsuit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia through the law firm Pomerantz LLP. The lawsuit specifically covers the period from April 2024 to April 2025 and alleges that Strategy overstated the profitability of its “Bitcoin-focused investment strategy” and the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. “As a result of the defendants’ unlawful acts and negligence and the sudden decrease in the market value of the company’s securities, the plaintiff and other community members have suffered significant damage,” the complaint stated. Related News: Is History Repeating Itself in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Predicts BTC's Movement in the Coming Days Based on Previous Data! Not only Saylor, but also the company's CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang are among the defendants in the lawsuit. The complaint also notes that Strategy adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) new regulation, ASU 2023-08, at the beginning of 2025. This regulation requires public companies to report cryptocurrencies at fair value in their financial statements and reflect these value changes in the income statement. Strategy previously used an accounting model that only recognized losses on decreases in value and did not consider increases in value unless sales occurred. Investors claim that the company has been presenting unrealistic and optimistic performance evaluations to the public even after switching to the new accounting standard. The company is alleged to have disregarded the huge losses that could have occurred after fair valuation while sharing positive figures such as “BTC Return,” “BTC Earnings,” and “BTC Dollar Earnings.” Strategy did not issue a press release on the matter, but did address the lawsuit in an SEC filing on Monday: “The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys' fees and other legal expenses on behalf of the community. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. It is not possible for us to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or estimate potential damages at this time.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T18:45:19.000Z,"Crypto Firms To Report Every Single Transaction Under New UK Laws","Businesses providing crypto services in the UK will be required to collect more extensive user and transaction data by next year. The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) says the new rule covers all UK-based reporting crypto-asset service providers (RCASPs), which include exchanges, brokers, dealers, and any firm that transacts with digital assets on behalf of users or provides a platform for the transactions. The government will implement the policy as part of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), a global initiative that promotes the exchange of information between countries to address tax evasion risks related to digital assets. “From 1 January 2026, if you provide cryptoasset services in the UK, you’ll have new responsibilities for collecting data and reporting it to HMRC . This is because the UK is introducing the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), and extending it to include domestic reporting.” Crypto firms will have to collect data such as names, dates of birth, addresses and country of residence for individual users and business names and addresses for entity users, which include companies, partnerships, trusts and charities. For transactions involving users based in the UK or other countries participating in the CARF, crypto firms need to record the type of crypto asset and transaction involved as well as the value and number of units. The HMRC urges crypto firms to verify the accuracy of the information they collect since there will be penalties of up to £300, or around $399, per user for inaccurate, incomplete or unverified reports.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million.

2025-05-19T21:32:21.000Z,"What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner","On May 22, US President Donald Trump is expected to host up to 220 people who had purchased the most significant quantities of his memecoin at a private event in Washington, DC.Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

While at first glance such data might suggest a lack of optimism, at the same time, it proves that the buying pressure is coming from the spot market rather than from leveraged bets.Japan bond spike and credit fears weigh on Bitcoin sentimentSome analysts attribute Bitcoin’s correction to comments by Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the country’s fiscal situation being “undoubtedly extremely poor,” as reported by Bloomberg. Japan 15-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

He suggested that the financial regulator  would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”Even before Atkins stepped into the role of SEC chair, the commission’s actions under Donald Trump suggested that it would radically depart from the direction of former chair Gary Gensler. In 2025, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies and issued guidance on memecoins and security tokens.Related: CFTC commissioner to leave agency on May 31“As I begin my tenure as Chairman, I can tell you that we are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation,” said Atkins. “The markets innovate, and the SEC should not be in the business of telling them to stand still.”Looking to Congress for market structureAtkins’ remarks came as US lawmakers considered draft legislation to establish a regulatory structure for crypto markets. The proposed bill, moving through the House of Representatives, could clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have in overseeing and regulating digital assets.Until the legislation passes Congress and is signed into law, the SEC’s rules and guidelines over crypto could face pushback from affected parties.The SEC chair has given opening remarks and overseen the commission’s roundtable events, discussing regulatory issues surrounding digital assets and blockchain.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain.

Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy.

OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market.

2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T09:59:39.000Z,"Dubai regulator sets compliance deadline for updated crypto rules","Dubai’s crypto regulator has given licensed digital asset companies until June 19 to comply with its updated activity-based Rulebooks to enhance market integrity and risk oversight. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period.“In line with global regulatory best practices, a 30-day transition period has been granted to all impacted virtual asset service providers [VASPs], with full compliance required by 19 June 2025,” VARA wrote.  VARA enhances supervisory mechanismsVARA highlighted that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms across several regulated activities. This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T08:46:53.000Z,"Apple KYC glitch on Bybit draws swift executive response to recover $100K","Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said it had involved team members, including an executive, to fix a glitch that affected a single user who could not go through an Apple-based know-your-client (KYC) system.In a May 18 X post, the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17.The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 reported fraud cases.Caught in actionThe bust followed police surveillance on May 15, when two recruits left the syndicate’s Mong Kok base — one visiting a bank, the other an ATM — before both went to convert the cash into crypto at a crypto exchange shop in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui.Police arrested both individuals on the spot, seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash before the funds could be laundered. The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after.Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions.Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
