2025-05-20T15:48:31.000Z,"Why Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòbig, beautiful‚Äô bill is bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins","President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòbig, beautiful‚Äô bill is set to become law, a move that some argue will increase U.S. deficits and debt while likely boosting Bitcoin and altcoin prices in the long term. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts Trump signed into law. It also introduces new tax measures he campaigned on, including a $1,000 tax credit for all children born in the country and exemptions for tips. It will also raise the estate tax exemption to $15 million. The ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù bill will likely be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins for several reasons. Big, beautiful bill to boost Bitcoin and altcoins First, the bill is expected to increase the U.S. public debt and deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it will raise public debt by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years. It will also push the debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% to 125%, compared to 117% under current law. The surging debt comes as the U.S. has lost its last triple-A credit rating from Moody‚Äôs. S&P Global and Fitch Ratings downgraded the country‚Äôs rating in 2011 and 2023, respectively. Rising risks of a U.S. government default are considered bullish for Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a safe-haven asset. Many Bitcoin analysts, including BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink , believe that it is digital gold. In a recent white paper , BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a unique diversifier and that many investors are buying it to hedge against growing U.S. debt.

Second, the ‚Äúbig, beautiful bill‚Äù could also boost Bitcoin by introducing new tax breaks, increasing the disposable income of many Americans. More disposable income could lead some people to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins. A notable example occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when Americans used stimulus checks to purchase Bitcoin. Additionally, the bill will likely expand the M2 money supply in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve may be forced to print money to fund the growing deficit. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked the M2 money supply, albeit with a lag. Most altcoins then tend to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. $BTC is perfectly mimicking Global M2 supply with a 90-day offset.

Falling recession risks would then be bullish for Bitcoin and other altcoins.

2025-05-20T15:47:39.000Z,"XMR made a new high for 2025 as demand slowly returns","Monero (XMR) keeps rising, reaching a new high for 2025. The privacy coin continued to grow, outperforming other assets, as demand returns. Monero (XMR) is making a return after posting a new peak for 2025 and the highest level for the past 12 months. XMR rose to $353.71 after weeks of gradual growth. The coin is now back to price levels not seen since 2021, setting up expectations for an even more active appreciation cycle. Initially, XMR was revived after a hacker used the token to swap out stolen BTC funds. Following the incident, XMR did not stop its expansion; instead, it retained higher baseline volumes above $80M in 24 hours. XMR never returned to levels from before the hack, instead reviving a long-forgotten trade. The asset has limited exposure to mainstream exchanges after delistings but retains its influence as a privately mined coin. XMR gets a boost from Asian markets The recent exposure for Monero on social media does not immediately translate to increased global trading. There are several specifics around XMR that may cut the rally short. More than 50% of XMR volumes are on KuCoin and HTX, exchanges that are usually difficult to access for international traders. XMR is also traded on smaller markets with significant counterparty risk. The asset is mostly banned from US-based and EU brokerages and exchanges due to its anonymous origins and untraceable wallets. Exchanges may also have problems with XMR withdrawals and reserves in the case of real rising demand for the coin. Some market operators also use a tokenized version of Monero. The asset is difficult to track. In the past day of growth, the XMR/ETH pair on KuCoin also showed anomalous activity, with volumes rising by over 274% in a day. The XMR/ETH pair was also highly active at the end of April as the hacker tried to swap out assets, leading to peak volumes. The other activity hub for XMR was Kraken, where the busiest pair expanded its volumes by over 1,621%. The biggest shift came from the smaller market Bitrue, where XMR activity spiked by 10,000% in an otherwise low-liquidity pair. The available liquidity for XMR may still be low for a proper bull market. In the short term, XMR has often outperformed other altcoins and even BTC. The revival of XMR is not only in its market activity. Monero mining is at an all-time high, more than doubling since April 2024. The network hashrate grew exponentially in the past month, showing a trend of returning to the network as a source of newly mined privacy coins. Monero mining reached an all-time high, with exponential expansion in the past month. | Source: Coinwarz Miners produce only 432 XMR per day, comparable to the BTC mining reward. The coin remains scarce as exchanges carry insignificant balances. Acquiring XMR may be the most accessible for miners, causing real scarcity for potential buyers. Monero uses CPU and GPU mining, offering easier access compared to ASIC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-05-20T15:46:01.000Z,"21Shares Predicts Supply Crunch to Push Bitcoin Toward $138K","21Shares reports rising institutional demand and tightening supply could push the Bitcoin price higher amid improving global macro conditions. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching a key breakout phase, bolstered by a convergence of structural factors that extend beyond retail speculation. According to a recent forecast by investment firm 21Shares, Bitcoin could reach $138,500 by the end of 2025.¬†The projection considers rising institutional participation, favorable macroeconomic shifts, and a deepening supply crunch.As of today, Bitcoin trades at $104,684, marking a 2.16% increase over the last 24 hours and a 0.95% rise over the past seven days.Institutional Buying Accelerates as Supply Dwindles21Shares reports that institutional capital has moved to the forefront of Bitcoin‚Äôs demand structure. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become consistent net buyers, now absorbing more than the daily 450 BTC generated through mining.¬†https://twitter.com/21Shares/status/1924807485556457684This persistent mismatch between supply and demand is reducing available inventory and supporting higher prices. Simultaneously, institutions are exploring alternative exposure strategies, including allocations via companies such as Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy and the upcoming Twenty One Capital.In parallel, per 21Shares‚Äô report , some public companies are beginning to hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. Additionally, jurisdictions such as New Hampshire and Texas have proposed legislation to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves.¬†Internationally, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund is reportedly accumulating BTC, signaling growing state-level interest in the asset. These developments indicate a foundational shift in how Bitcoin is being adopted and retained by long-term holders.Macroeconomic Trends Reinforce Positive OutlookThe broader macroeconomic environment is also playing a significant role in Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory. Central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are expected to reverse course after two years of rate hikes.Real yields are falling, and the U.S. dollar has weakened in recent months. Concurrently, global liquidity is expanding as central banks in Europe, Japan, and China increase their balance sheets. These changes support risk assets, with Bitcoin notably sensitive to such liquidity movements.Per 21Shares , improved U.S.‚ÄìChina relations have also added momentum. A recent easing of trade tensions between the two countries has lifted investor sentiment. Equity markets have risen, credit spreads have tightened, and monetary indicators such as M2 and the ISM Manufacturing Index have begun to recover. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked M2 growth with a 12-week lag, a pattern that appears to be repeating.Historical Trends Inform Current Projections21Shares notes how Bitcoin‚Äôs previous rallies have typically occurred six to twelve months after a halving event. Past cycles, such as those in 2017 and 2020, were often driven by retail enthusiasm and loose monetary policy. While a tenfold gain is not anticipated this time, 21Shares states that a doubling or tripling from Bitcoin‚Äôs previous $69,000 peak aligns with historical post-halving behavior.Additionally, retail participation remains moderate compared to past cycles, suggesting that current price growth is primarily institutional in nature. Capital is reportedly flowing from registered investment advisors (RIAs), wirehouses, and corporate investors. This pattern, distinct from prior bull runs, points to a more durable demand base.Other Firms Eyeing $130K And Above¬†In October of last year, research firm Ecoinometrics released an analysis indicating that Bitcoin‚Äôs value could potentially double over the following 12 months. This projection was based on the assumption that both Bitcoin and the broader equity markets would sustain upward momentum throughout the period. Under such conditions, the firm suggested that BTC could reach around $130,000 by late 2025, marking a 100% increase from its value at the time of the report.Meanwhile, investment manager VanEck, known for issuing crypto ETFs, outlined a long-term forecast for Bitcoin extending through 2050. The firm presented three distinct scenarios, with its baseline case placing Bitcoin‚Äôs value at $2.9 million by 2050. In contrast, VanEck‚Äôs conservative‚Äîor bear‚Äîcase forecasted a minimum value of $130,314 by that time.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/20/21shares-predicts-supply-crunch-to-push-bitcoin-toward-138k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=21shares-predicts-supply-crunch-to-push-bitcoin-toward-138k,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Trending Now|Bitcoin Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T15:35:00.000Z,"Cryptocurrencies Are Going Mainstream, On Wall Street And In Washington","Summary Bitcoin and crypto are becoming increasingly integrated into Wall Street and Washington. The global crypto market skyrocketed from a $4 billion to $3.5 trillion market cap over the past decade. Pro-crypto policies are increasingly in favor in Washington, but volatility and consumer protections remain concerns. By James Picerno When bitcoin was launched 16 years ago, few, if any, observers anticipated that the world‚Äôs original cryptocurrency would usher in a digital asset revolution that would become deeply woven into the existing financial system. Crypto, after all, was designed to be a revolution against the status quo. But in 2025, digital currencies increasingly look like a part of the establishment rather than the idealistic libertarian crusade initially envisioned. The original motivation for crypto was that it would reinvent, if not subvert, traditional finance, while providing individuals with an off-the-grid alternative to the conventional monetary ecosystem. But as recent events remind, crypto continues to go mainstream and is becoming ever more integrated into Wall Street and Washington. Surprising? Maybe not, when you consider that there‚Äôs more money to be made in established world of finance vs. the radical fringe. Yet, the evolution of crypto can be bewildering when you consider that there are still few legal uses for bitcoin (and its growing list of competitors) as a currency beyond speculation. So far, however, that hasn‚Äôt slowed the rise of crypto as a widely held asset. A big winner is the underlying plumbing - the blockchain system that enables crypto transactions. This distributed, decentralized computer network for transactions is finding wider adoption across the financial industry, which in turn is helping spawn demand for all things crypto. The overall growth has been nothing less than astonishing. A decade the global market value of crypto currencies was less than $4 billion, according to CoinGecko . The dollar value has since surged to nearly $3.5 trillion - an increase of nearly 87,000%! By comparison, the US stock market (S&P 500 Index ( SPX )) has increased 216% over past ten years. The latest milestone for crypto‚Äôs evolution as a mainstream industry: shares of Coinbase ( COIN ), a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, were added to the S&P 500 Index last week. In a sign of the times, Coinbase replaced Discover Financial Services, a conventional bank and credit card firm that‚Äôs being acquired by Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF ). Joining the S&P 500 is more than a decision on a whim by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee, which oversees the stock market index. The S&P requires that a company clear several hurdles, including posting a profit in its latest quarterly update and maintaining a market capitalization of at least $10 billion. On the Nasdaq stock exchange, DeFi Technologies ( DEFT ) recently started trading. The company, which a few years ago was considered a long-shot financial disrupter, has evolved into a major player in crypto finance. Another corner of crypto that‚Äôs rapidly finding adoption by the mainstream is the so-called stablecoin market, which is shorthand for digital tokens backed by conventional assets, such as Tether, which has a market capitalization of more than $151 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. As products that connect cryptocurrencies with traditional currencies, such as the US dollar, stablecoins seek to maintain a steady value and facilitate conventional financial transactions. Mastercard ( MA ) - one of the major credit card firms - recently said it will allow companies and individuals to make and receive payments in stablecoin accounts. Earlier this year, Stripe ( STRIP ) - a payments platform - bought Bridge, a stablecoin platform. The acquisition is widely seen as a sign that the stablecoin market, after years of growth, is on track for wider use in the financial system. By one estimate, the total value of transactions in stablecoins in 2024 was comparable to Visa‚Äôs ( V ), another leading firm in the credit card industry. Meanwhile, Washington has become a center of crypto enthusiasm with the arrival of the Trump administration. In addition to the President‚Äôs launch of a meme coin this year, along with his sons‚Äô promotion of various crypto ventures, the US federal regulatory environment for digital assets has become much friendlier in 2025. In contrast with the Biden administration‚Äôs aggressive (some would say hostile) approach to overseeing the industry, the White House this year has appointed pro-crypto regulators, such as Paul Atkins, who heads the Securities and Exchange Commission and previously was co-chairman of Token Alliance, an advocacy group for the crypto industry. Wall Street hasn‚Äôt been shy about cashing in on crypto. There are now nearly 40 ETFs targeting various niches, including bitcoin and ether as well as trading strategies focused on the assets. The largest crypto ETF is iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). Launched in January 2024, the fund currently has more than $65 billion in assets. Since inception, IBIT‚Äôs price has more than doubled, far ahead of the S&P 500‚Äôs roughly 25% increase over that span, based on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). With so much going right for the crypto industry, what could go wrong? Several familiar risks continue to lurk, including high market volatility for the likes of bitcoin and the rise of crypto-related cybercrime and scams. A more fundamental challenge for the longer run is developing consumer protections on par with traditional financial assets. Although the regulatory outlook has turned friendly in Washington for crypto, legislation remains a work in progress. The latest step toward wider adoption of crypto arrived on Monday, when the US Senate advanced the GENUIS Act bill, the first major crypto regulatory reform for the stablecoins. Critics charge that the legislation will give Big Tech firms, such as Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Apple ( AAPL ), a relatively free hand to operate their own stablecoins. But while debate rolls on about what constitutes consumer-friendly regulation, there‚Äôs a near-consensus that with or without approval of the GENUIS Act, time favors the business opportunities for crypto. Or so it appears, based on investor sentiment for the business outlook. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), which holds a portfolio of companies operating in the crypto economy, is outperforming the US stock market by a wide margin over the past year with a 56% rally vs. 24% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ((SPY)). A key question is how much of crypto‚Äôs fortunes rely on the political success and influence of Republicans? To the extent that there‚Äôs bipartisan support in Washington for crypto regulation, the odds will look more favorable for expecting that crypto‚Äôs mainstream adoption and integration into the wider economy will flourish beyond the next election cycle.

In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said that this brings the company‚Äôs total Bitcoin acquisitions to $78 million, with the latest tranche purchased at a weighted average price of $103,234 per BTC. $KULR has acquired 83.3 BTC for ~ 9 million To learn more about our acquistion and our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, check out today's press release. https://t.co/vuQk90DCgh pic.twitter.com/KrW3E4e700 ‚Äî KULR Technology (@KULRTech) May 20, 2025 This move is part of KULR‚Äôs broader Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, first announced on December 4, 2024, which allows for up to 90% of the company‚Äôs surplus cash reserves to be allocated to Bitcoin. The company said it sees this as a way to preserve and potentially enhance shareholder value in an inflationary economic environment. KULR Reports BTC Yield of 220.26% Central to this strategy is KULR‚Äôs use of ‚ÄúBTC Yield‚Äù as a key performance indicator (KPI). Year-to-date, the company reports a BTC Yield of 220.26%, demonstrating the growth in Bitcoin holdings relative to the company‚Äôs fully diluted share count. This metric provides insight into the effectiveness of KULR‚Äôs treasury allocation model. ‚ÄúBTC Yield offers a unique lens through which to evaluate how effectively we‚Äôre leveraging digital assets to drive long-term value,‚Äù a company spokesperson stated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a forward-thinking approach to corporate treasury management.‚Äù However, KULR also cautions investors against viewing BTC Yield as a direct measure of operational or financial performance. It does not account for liabilities, nor is it designed to predict stock performance. Instead, it serves as a supplemental tool for understanding the growth of digital asset holdings in relation to share dilution. Despite the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies, KULR said it remains committed to disciplined financial management and long-term strategic planning. The company urges investors to consider BTC Yield in conjunction with traditional financial statements and SEC filings.

2025-05-20T15:32:44.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips Below $105,000 As Momentum Continues To Lag","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses during the ongoing session, dropping below the $105,000 level as selling pressure at higher levels kept bullish momentum at bay. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $102,145 on Monday as it started the week in the red before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,573. Despite the decline, BTC remains up by over 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,700. Australia Court Ruling Could Lead To $640M In BTC Tax Refunds A court ruling in Australia could see as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions. The judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. According to reports, the decision came during a hearing for a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole over 80 Bitcoin in 2019. Judge Michael O‚ÄôConnell ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, linking the asset to Australian Dollars instead of shares, gold, or foreign currency. Judge O‚ÄôConnell‚Äôs interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially putting Bitcoin outside the purview of Australia‚Äôs CGT regime. Tax lawyer Adrian Cartland stated that the verdict upends the Australian Taxation Office‚Äôs (ATO) current position on crypto assets. The ATO has classified Bitcoin and other crypto assets as CGT assets. This meant holders had to pay tax when trading or selling the assets. The ATO stated that selling or exchanging Bitcoin for any other crypto or using it to purchase goods and services was a CGT event. Cartland stated, ‚ÄúThat is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences.‚Äù JPMorgan CEO Says Bank Will Allow Clients To Buy Bitcoin JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, has said that the bank will allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin. Dimon announced the move during a speech at the bank‚Äôs annual investor day on May 19. ‚ÄúWe are going to allow you to buy it. We‚Äôre not going to custody it. We‚Äôre going to put it in statements for clients.‚Äù The decision to allow customers to purchase Bitcoin is significant, given Dimon‚Äôs views on the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader crypto market. Dimon had called Bitcoin worthless in 2021, and reiterated his stance in 2023 during a Senate hearing and again in 2024 at the World Economic Forum. The JPMorgan CEO had stated that he has always been opposed to Bitcoin and crypto, noting that the only true use case of cryptocurrencies for criminals, money laundering, and tax evasion. While the JPMorgan CEO has maintained a negative view of crypto and BTC , the broader banking and financial system has embraced them, with institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley tapping into the crypto ecosystem for their clients. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck under $105,000 as it extended its losses during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week with a drop to $102,045 as selling pressure intensified. However, it recouped some losses, rising to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,573. Analysts believe that despite BTC‚Äôs less-than-impressive start to the week, the overall sentiment around the asset was bullish. ‚ÄúThe break above key support levels and targeting of the resistance zone near $107,500 suggest a strong potential for a new all-time high, driven by healthier market dynamics rather than speculative excess. Institutional interest remains a key catalyst, as evidenced by JPMorgan‚Äôs recent announcement to offer Bitcoin access via spot ETFs, a significant endorsement from a major traditional finance player following Morgan Stanley‚Äôs similar moves.‚Äù Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered their best day of trading since the beginning of May as smaller funds registered healthy inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw inflows worth $188 million in 24 hours, while ARK 21Shares registered inflows of $155 million. The two funds accounted for half the funds invested across all Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. Bitcoin ETFs registered total inflows of $667 million as BTC maintained its position above $100,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated, ‚ÄúBitcoin faces strong resistance at $107,000 and must remain above $105,000 to break through this level. Spot ETF inflows continue to boost the asset, with $360 million recorded yesterday. If this move sustains a new high ($110,000) is likely this month where open interest among derivatives is concentrated.‚Äù BTC started the previous weekend on a positive note, rising nearly 2% on Saturday and settling at $104,617. However, it lost momentum on Sunday, dropping almost 1% to $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,458 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Source: TradingView Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, registering a marginal decline. BTC continued to drop on Saturday, falling 0.30% and settling at $103,235.

2025-05-20T15:30:35.000Z,"Ripple CEO Clashes With Senate Crypto Chair Lummis","A simmering dispute between Ripple Labs chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) burst into the open on Monday, May 19, after the senator‚Äôs staff cancelled a meeting with the fintech executive and declined to offer a new date. Ripple CEO Starts Public Dispute Garlinghouse, already in Washington to lobby for the pending GENIUS Act on stablecoins and for broader market-structure reform, took the unusual step of airing the dispute on X. ‚ÄúHeading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation ‚Ä¶ That said, @SenLummis, as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, cancelled a meeting with me (and won‚Äôt reschedule),‚Äù he wrote, before challenging the senator to debate him ‚Äúanytime‚Äù in an X Space or on stage at upcoming industry conferences. ‚ÄúAs a leader in Congress and Senator from one of the most crypto-friendly states (WY), I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto. I invite you to join me on an X Space anytime (or a live convo onstage at one of the many events we cross paths at) to talk about how to make the US the crypto capital of the world, as is the goal of the Trump Administration. I will continue to do everything possible to support that goal,‚Äù Garlinghouse wrote via X. Senator Lummis has not commented publicly on the cancellation, but her office confirmed she is concentrating this week on floor action related to the stable-coin bill, which cleared a 65-32 procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday morning and will now face a lengthy amendment process. The Wyoming Republican‚Äîlong celebrated by Bitcoin advocates‚Äîwas tapped in January to chair the Banking Committee‚Äôs new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, a post that gives her first crack at shaping federal crypto legislation. At the time of her appointment she declared that ‚Äúdigital assets are the future‚Äù and pressed colleagues to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Garlinghouse‚Äôs public rebuke exposed a deepening philosophical divide: the Ripple chief argues that US policy must be ‚Äúmultichain,‚Äù whereas Lummis has positioned herself as the Senate‚Äôs fiercest pro-Bitcoin voice. Bitcoin Maximalists Cheer, Ripple Allies Bristle The senator‚Äôs supporters inside the Bitcoin community applauded the snub. Troy Cross of the Bitcoin Policy Institute thanked Lummis: ‚ÄúJust when you thought Lummis couldn‚Äôt be a better Bitcoiner. Sen Lummis for keeping the scammers at bay.‚Äù Pierre Rochard, vice-president of research at Riot Platforms, derided Garlinghouse on X, claiming he had ‚Äú ruined [his] reputation and lost all credibility by pushing for CBDCs and against Bitcoin,‚Äù while market commentator Joe Consorti said the Ripple chief‚Äôs ‚Äúlifetime of bashing Bitcoin‚Äù had left him with ‚Äúzero credibility.‚Äù XRP partisans fired back.

2025-05-20T15:25:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe Presale Countdown Begins‚ÄîMay Exchange Listings Confirmed","The charts are glowing green again, and crypto confidence is creeping back fast. Bitcoin has surpassed $100K, market sentiment is shifting, and there is a familiar sense of \""don‚Äôt miss the next one\"" in the air. Right on cue, Bitcoin Pepe , the world‚Äôs only Bitcoin meme ICO, is about to go live. Bitcoin maxis will finally stop coping because an entire layer 2 platform is being created where DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins can thrive on Bitcoin. With a presale that‚Äôs raised over $8m, Bitcoin Pepe is confident and already building. It lists 31st May, which means time‚Äôs almost up to scoop up BPEP for just $0.0326. As BTC approaches its previous all-time highs, this might be the ideal opportunity for a subsequent trade. Here‚Äôs why! Bitcoin Pepe: Boomer base layer, zoomer energy Bitcoin Pepe is building what no one has pulled off yet: a Solana-style network experience running on top of Bitcoin. This translates to quicker transactions, reduced fees, and a more seamless interface, all while utilizing Bitcoin's robust security features. At the heart of it is PEP-20, a new token standard purpose-built for Bitcoin. It allows anyone to issue tokens natively on BTC‚Äôs base layer, cutting out the friction that‚Äôs kept Bitcoin behind in meme culture, retail activity, and DeFi. It‚Äôs like ERC-20‚Äôs explosive early days, but now on the oldest, most trusted chain. The goal is to unlock Bitcoin‚Äôs vast capital base, now at over $2 trillion , and finally connect it with the meme ecosystems, NFT platforms, and fast-moving token economies that have so far belonged to Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin Pepe is building infrastructure, and if successful, it could set the standard for how future token projects live and grow on Bitcoin. Solana on Bitcoin + meme mania = 1000x crypto energy incoming Bitcoin dominance just surged above 60% for the first time since early 2021. But most of that capital is idle, locked in cold storage, held by institutions, or priced out of growth opportunities. Bitcoin Pepe offers a new outlet: one that taps into BTC‚Äôs reputation for security while layering on the culture, speed, and experimentation that have always driven outsized gains. For the first time, holders will be able to stake, trade, and participate in meme-native activity without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. BPEP arrives as both a protocol and a product that speaks to where the market is headed: performance, participation, and permissionless culture. Solana launched with speed, low fees, and a $0.22 token, and it pulled off one of the biggest runs the market‚Äôs seen. But that was a different cycle; Solana was new, and it still had to earn trust. It didn‚Äôt have much of a runway, timing, or execution. Bitcoin Pepe is focusing intensively on timing, leverage, architecture, and attention. As capital rushes back in, with Tier 1 listings already in sight, this may not just echo Solana‚Äôs rise; it might outrun it. BPEP launches on 31st May as markets open up If you have ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through charts and muttering to yourself, \""I should have invested earlier,\"" then this is your opportunity to reset. This is a market turning green, Bitcoin leading again, and a clear gap where culture meets infrastructure. It‚Äôs not copying what worked elsewhere; it‚Äôs building what never existed here in the first place. Namely, Bitcoin Pepe is launching straight into the core of crypto‚Äôs most trusted, most capital-rich network, Bitcoin, right as momentum returns to the entire market. It unlocks a side of it that‚Äôs never been touched. With launch set for the end of May and Tier-1 exchange interest starting to surface, the current price of $0.0326 may be the lowest BPEP will ever see.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Memecoin Rally Fading? Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Dogwifhat (WIF) Lose Momentum","If crypto is going up, then the memecoins will probably go up faster than anything else. That said, the inverse of this is also true. Bitcoin continues to balk at the $104,000 resistance, and this has had the effect of putting the dampers on the rest of the market. Do memecoins $PEPE, $BONK, and $WIF still have a rally left in them? Signs are that $PEPE could be about to roll over Source: TradingView $PEPE was not only the leading memecoin over the previous week, but also the highest percentage climber for just about any of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. That said, the $PEPE price has come up against solid resistance. The current weekly candle has stopped short of the 0.382 Fibonacci level and is shaping to leave a longish wick to the upside, unless the bulls can do something about this over Friday and the weekend. Even if the bulls can turn the current weekly candle positive, the major horizontal resistance at $0.00001600 still remains an important barrier to upside continuation. Finally, the Stochastic RSI indicators are getting back to the top. If they start rolling over before $PEPE is able to surpass the all-time high, this whole rally could be a failed one. $BONK bulls must break back above major ascending trendline Source: TradingView The $BONK price has followed a nice rally thus far, with three higher highs and likely another higher low for this week. However, the price has run into the major horizontal resistance at $0.000025 and has been soundly rejected. The rejection has also taken the price below the bull market ascending trendline, but it is currently holding the strong horizontal support. Source: TradingView The weekly time frame gives a clear picture, and shows the importance of the bulls breaking through the ascending trendline. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that unless some kind of catalyst arrives soon, the indicators could roll over and head back down, potentially putting paid to any decent upside for the next few weeks. The writing may be on the wall for $WIF Source: TradingView $WIF is in a similar predicament. A good upside surge has come into heavy resistance levels and is looking like being rejected. Yes, there is the possibility that the Stochastic RSI indicators chop along the top for a while, but if a Bitcoin breakout does not happen over this weekend, the writing is probably on the wall for $WIF, and the next potential rally might have to wait several weeks for the Stochastic RSI to reset. Keep your eyes on Bitcoin (BTC) Finally, if Bitcoin (BTC) does succeed in breaking through its $104,000 major horizontal resistance, and goes on to surpass the all-time high, all bets are off. Memecoins would undoubtedly surge in this scenario. Bitcoin is definitely the one to watch. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong, Returns to $104,000 Resistance Level","Bitcoin bulls are refusing to be deterred. A bearish chart pattern had formed going into Thursday, but in spite of a drop in price, a higher low was formed and now the bulls are back and pushing for the highs again. Better PPI data but Powell still concerned While Bitcoin perhaps readies itself for a breakout, the news in the US economy is still that uncertainty reigns. Although lower than expected PPI data was released on Thursday, adding to the general cooling of inflation that has continued to be experienced, a speech by Jerome Powell yesterday still carried very hawkish overtones. He warned of more frequent ‚Äúsupply shocks‚Äù caused by President Trump‚Äôs global tariffs, and that these would be likely to cause more volatile inflation. These comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell do not inspire confidence that interest rates will be lowered any time soon. It looks like Trump and Powell will be banging heads for some time to come. That said, at least in the US stock market, bullish sentiment is becoming very strong. The Fear and Greed Index is deeply in the Greed sector with a reading of 69. S&P 500 getting back to the highs Source: TradingView The S&P 500 is a sight to behold. From the terrible crash down below 5,000 points in the depths of the Trump global tariff impositions, the index has rallied just as quickly back to the upside. Currently back at 5,916 points, the S&P 500 does not have that far to go to make a new all-time high at 6,150, before potentially reentering the ascending channel. $BTC bullish setup on very short time frame Source: TradingView The 1-hour chart for $BTC depicts a bullish setup. A descending trendline drawn from the top of the $105,700 local high made on Monday kept the price below until early on Friday when a breakout occurred. The $104,440 resistance was touched before the price came back down. A confirmation of the breakout could be about to take place, which might also confirm the $103,700 resistance as support. If the breakout becomes a fakeout, as the price falls on through the trendline and the horizontal level, the bears could take the price back down to the $102,000 area. The trend is still up Source: TradingView Moving out slightly into the 4-hour time frame things do look more uncertain, at least as far as the bulls are concerned. The price has just now dipped under the descending trendline, so this would tend to favour the fakeout scenario, although there is still time for the price to reverse. It should be noted that the price action is making lower highs. This might correspond with higher lows, thereby forcing the price into an up or down decision sooner or later. Generally, the price action is traversing inside a range, which extends from $101,700 at the bottom, to $104,800 at the top. As long as the price does not make a lower low below $100,700 the trend is still up. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-20T15:25:44.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction ‚Äì Will It Become the Best Altcoin to Buy This Year?","As cryptocurrency continues to move from niche interest to mainstream discussion, new projects pop up regularly, each promising a unique advantage. One that‚Äôs drawn attention is Pi Network, a mobile-first mining platform accessible to anyone with a smartphone. But with an uncertain trading future and a launch on a few major exchanges, investors are beginning to question whether Pi Network will become the best altcoin to buy this year. In this article, we‚Äôll look at what Pi Network is doing right and where it still needs to improve. We'll also compare it to some of the more grounded, active projects in the space, including a few lesser-known altcoins that are already available, trading, or in presale with clearer roadmaps. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out for its combination of innovation, accessibility, and use of AI to simplify crypto investing. Understanding Pi Network (And A 2025 Price Prediction) Pi Network launched to make cryptocurrency mining easy for everyone. Users download the mobile app and earn Pi tokens by simply logging in and confirming they're not a bot. The pitch? No battery drain, no special equipment, and no complicated onboarding process. This simplicity helped it quickly attract millions of users. Pi Network recently reached 'open mainnet' status and was listed on a few exchanges. However, many holders who had been mining for years before this point still need to wait before they can actually cash out, which has sparked more questions about the true value of Pi. While Pi Network focuses on easy access and getting people involved, its recency and the absence of market value make it difficult to analyze its future. The same goes for an accurate Pi network price prediction in 2025. Currently valued at $0.8832, analysts forecast the token could reach $2-3 this year: the worst-case scenario is a minimum of $0.60. Top 3 Altcoins to Watch Right Now Instead of waiting for Pi to surge, some investors are looking toward other altcoins already delivering results or building practical ecosystems. Three projects could attract attention this year, starting with Dawgz AI. 1. Dawgz AI - The AI Trading Meme Coin Dawgz AI blends meme coin style with technology that serves a purpose. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers automated AI-driven trading tools for users who want hands-free investing. These bots use algorithmic strategies to react to market shifts, helping holders stay active in the market without doing everything manually. One interesting part of Dawgz AI is how it gamifies bot usage. When you stake your tokens, you unlock bot access at different levels. The higher the tier, the more advanced the bot features become. This gives users a reason to hold rather than flip the token. Security-wise, Dawgz AI has completed an audit by SolidProof , adding a level of trust and transparency. The presale price currently sits at $0.004 and will rise to $0.00438 soon. With over $3.5 million already raised, interest in the project is growing. The total supply is 8.88 billion tokens, with 20% going toward staking rewards, which adds a passive earning component. Whether you‚Äôre drawn in by the meme-themed branding or the functional tools, Dawgz AI offers something different! 2. VeChain (VET) - Blockchain for Tracking Supply Chains VeChain continues to garner attention due to its practical use cases in supply chain logistics. The project allows companies to track products from creation to delivery using blockchain for transparency. This use has already been adopted in industries like fashion, automotive, and food safety. Unlike more speculative coins, VeChain has been live for years and is actively used by enterprise clients. Its dual-token system (VET for value transfer and VTHO for operations) helps control costs while maintaining scalability. While price movement hasn't been explosive recently, the coin remains relatively low-cost and has the kind of enterprise partnerships many new projects would envy. For investors looking for a token tied to real-world application, VeChain offers a distinctive angle. 3. Stacks (STX) - Bringing Smart Contracts and DeFi to Bitcoin. Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain that enables smart contracts and DeFi tools on Bitcoin. It brings functionality like NFTs and dApps to Bitcoin‚Äôs secure base layer, aiming to turn BTC into more than just a store of value. This year, attention around Bitcoin-native applications has grown, especially with rising interest in Ordinals and Bitcoin-based NFTs. Stacks benefits directly from this trend and has seen volume and network activity spikes. For people who believe in Bitcoin's long-term strength but want exposure to more flexible tech, STX offers a middle ground. It remains under $1, keeping it affordable while delivering unique access to BTC development. Final Thoughts: Is Pi Network Worth the Wait? Pi Network has certainly built a large following, with the hope of greater prominence in the coming months. Still, many traders would consider the project uncharted territory given the long time it took to become official. In contrast, projects like Dawgz AI and others listed above allow you to act today. Whether you want an AI-enhanced trading experience, a token linked to enterprise use, or something tied to DeFi technology, there are multiple paths to explore. With so many altcoins under $1 offering actual features and trading options, waiting around for Pi may leave you on the sidelines. Choosing an active project could help you stay ahead of the next market wave, and Dawgz AI might be one of the most interesting ways to do it. FAQs Section Will pi ever be worth money? It could be, but only if it lives up to its promises and gets listed on more exchanges. Meanwhile, other projects already in presale or trading may be more worthwhile. Which crypto will boom in 2025? AI-powered and meme-based projects like Dawgz AI are arguably gaining the most attention this year. Which crypto will hit $1? Lower-cost tokens with working ecosystems and active development, especially in presale phases, might be better positioned to approach the $1 mark as adoption grows.

2025-05-20T15:08:18.000Z,"Strive to acquire ‚Äòdistressed‚Äô Mt. Gox Bitcoin at discounted price","Strive Enterprises, the asset management firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has announced plans to purchase distressed Bitcoin claims. Some of these claims include those tied to the Mt. Gox estate. This announcement came through a strategic partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group.¬†The move is aimed at acquiring discounted Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure for Strive‚Äôs investment products. According to the SEC filing , the partnership will target claims that have been legally settled but not yet distributed, such as approximately 75,000 BTC from Mt. Gox‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings. By acquiring these claims below market value, Strive wants to enhance its Bitcoin-per-share metric and deliver long-term outperformance relative to BTC. The company is positioning the move as a value-driven strategy , offering investors exposure to Bitcoin without paying the full market price. Strive framed the transaction as part of a broader plan to capitalize on inefficiencies in the crypto credit market. Vivek Ramaswamy‚Äôs journey with Strive Vivek Ramaswamy co-founded Strive back in 2022 to challenge the prevailing ESG and DEI investment trends, advocating instead for shareholder primacy and depoliticized capitalism. Ramaswamy resigned as Executive Chairman in 2023 to pursue a presidential bid, after which Matt Cole took over leadership. Ramaswamy briefly joined DOGE but stepped down to potentially pursue a role in Ohio politics. Under Cole, Strive expanded into wealth management and embraced Bitcoin, planning to become the first publicly traded asset manager with a Bitcoin treasury. Ramaswamy no longer holds an executive role, but his vision continues to shape Strive‚Äôs direction, according to the company. Strive‚Äôs merger with Asset Entities The filing also noted that the transaction is tied to a proposed merger between Strive and Asset Entities Inc. ‚Äî a move that would result in a combined company with greater scale and access to public capital markets. ASST is expected to issue new shares as part of the deal. Mt. Gox, once the world‚Äôs leading Bitcoin exchange, collapsed in 2014 after a series of hacks led to the loss of over 800,000 BTC. Creditors have waited more than a decade for partial recovery, with distributions now expected in the coming months.

Market is getting more confident with rising accumulation across all investor groups. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin‚Äôs Accumulation Trend Score is rising especially among whale cohorts. Addresses holding 100-1,000 BTC and 1,000-10,000 BTC have high accumulation scores of 0.9 and 0.85 respectively while even retail holders with less than 1 BTC are joining in at 0.55 . Accumulation is now visible across nearly the entire wallet spectrum. Even $BTC holders have flipped from distribution to light accumulation (~0.55), joining larger cohorts like 100‚Äì1K (~0.9) and 1K‚Äì10K #BTC (~0.85). Only 1‚Äì10 #BTC remain net sellers. pic.twitter.com/C4C9ZLlwNs ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 This suggests long term conviction despite short term volatility. The only group still in distribution is 1-10 BTC but overall accumulation is strong and indicates market participants are positioning for a breakout. Historically similar accumulation heatmaps (transitioning from blue to red) have preceded major price rallies. Key accumulation insights: Large holders (100-10,000 BTC) are buying Total market cap is $2.08 trillion BTC supply is nearing 21M with 19.86M already in circulation RSI Divergence Creates Urgency for Bitcoin Bulls While accumulation signals are bullish, momentum indicators are flashing a warning.

This happens when price prints a higher high but RSI makes a lower high ‚Äì indicating weakening buying strength. there's a daily $btc bear div brewing here if it closes red by tomorrow. its unfortunate that its appeared before fresh ath's but its the first one since last year. be careful with longs imo pic.twitter.com/ZYw49WAbDK ‚Äî Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) May 19, 2025 Bitcoin analyst Matthew Hyland said the same on the weekly chart. He said Bitcoin must move to $120K-$130K in the next few weeks to maintain RSI structure and prevent a larger pullback. If not, it could trigger a weekly bearish divergence and derail the current rally. #BTC Weekly Bulls have been in control and I've repeated this for the past month while everyone called for pullbacks If the Bulls want to remain in control they must continue to push the price higher in the coming weeks based on the highest weekly candle close ever and the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1r87WEQYL7 ‚Äî Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) May 19, 2025 ‚ÄúBulls must push the weekly RSI above December 2024 highs to remain in control,‚Äù Hyland said. This divergence could be a speed bump for further gains ‚Äì unless price action accelerates soon. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Buy the Dip Still Intact Despite RSI headwinds, Bitcoin‚Äôs technicals on the 2 hour chart are still bullish. Price is respecting the ascending channel since early May. After bouncing from both the lower trendline and the 50 period EMA at $104,358, bulls took control with a spinning top followed by a bullish engulfing candle. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview Earlier a three white soldiers pattern preceded the move to $107,000. If BTC gets back to $105,500, the targets are $107,000 and $108,600 ‚Äì the top of the channel. Bulls Trade Setup: Entry : $104,250-104,350 (buy the dip zone) Stop Loss : $103,800 Target : $107,000-108,600 Bias : Bullish if higher lows and EMA support holds MACD is still soft but showing signs of reversal as the histogram bars contract. Conclusion: Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI divergence and whale accumulation is a mixed but key setup. If bulls can break $108K, the move to $120K may happen faster than you think. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins‚Äînone more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.01 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties.

Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think‚ÄîAnalyst The company wants to raise $100 million to start building a BTC reserve, and it says half of its net profits will go toward buying more. The announcement got a lot of attention‚Äîmaybe too much, too fast. Stock Soars On Bitcoin Reserve Plan DigiAsia‚Äôs stock, which trades under the ticker FAAS on the Nasdaq, closed the day up more than 91% at 36 cents, Google Finance data shows. But the excitement didn‚Äôt last long. After hours, the price dropped 20% to 28 cents. That sudden move shows how quickly investor mood can shift, especially when crypto is involved. Source: Google Finance The stock had been down around 50% this year before the announcement. It was trading close to $12 back in March 2024. Now, it‚Äôs nowhere near those highs. This latest surge looks like a shot of adrenaline, not a long-term fix. Bitcoin Reserve Plan And Profit Pledge DigiAsia isn‚Äôt just talking about Bitcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs making it part of its future profits. The company‚Äôs board has already approved a plan to treat Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. That means it‚Äôs not just holding cash; it wants BTC in its back pocket. It also said it would put up to 50% of its net profits into acquiring Bitcoin. The company is currently looking to raise up to $100 million to get that plan moving. It might use tools like convertible notes or crypto finance products to do that. Management is also in talks with regulated partners to figure out how to earn yield on its holdings, possibly through lending or staking. Revenue Growing But Still Small Based on an April 1 financial update, DigiAsia brought in $101 million in revenue in 2024, a 36% jump from the year before. It‚Äôs aiming for $125 million in 2025, with projected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million. That‚Äôs solid growth, but the company is still small compared to others getting into Bitcoin.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation. The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks. In ‚ÄúFat Protocols,‚Äù Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook. Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market. As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value. A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis. In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains. According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities. As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads ‚Äî but the apps are building the cities.\"" Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto‚Äôs liquidity crisis But without ‚Äúroads,'‚Äô it's impossible to navigate and access ‚Äúcities.'‚Äô Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective. Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential. Blockchains are fundamental to crypto markets Blockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer. The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly. It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital. Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency. Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance. These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains. ‚ÄúValue‚Äù doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue. Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T14:55:19.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge Again","Bitcoin has clawed its way back into the spotlight. After briefly touching the $107,000 mark before slipping into a minor correction, the top digital asset is showing signs of resilience‚Äîand renewed momentum. What‚Äôs sparking this renewed confidence isn‚Äôt just the price action. It‚Äôs the capital flow behind it. Bitcoin ETFs have begun recording large-scale inflows once again, hinting at a deeper resurgence in investor appetite. While retail traders are reacting to the headlines, the bigger move seems to be happening in boardrooms and trading desks. ETF Inflows Rise Sharply as Institutional Activity Returns On May 19, U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs absorbed over $667 million in net inflows‚Äîthe most since early May. Nearly half of that went into the iShares Bitcoin Trust alone, a signal that institutional desks are not just watching but participating. With ETF volumes rising sharply and the basis trade yield inching toward 9%, institutional players are quietly stepping back in, sensing favorable conditions for leveraged exposure and arbitrage-driven returns. A confluence of market factors now makes the basis trade highly attractive again. The strategy‚Äîbuying spot ETFs while shorting futures on CME‚Äînow yields close to 9%, nearly double April‚Äôs spread. That kind of return doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed in hedge fund circles. CME futures trading volumes tell the story just as well. With $8.4 billion traded and open interest rising by more than 30,000 BTC since April‚Äôs lows, the futures market is waking up. It‚Äôs not just about betting on price‚Äîthis is about exploiting inefficiencies that had dried up earlier this year. While volumes haven‚Äôt reached January‚Äôs frenzy‚Äîwhen Bitcoin peaked at $109K‚Äîthe momentum is building. The fact that these inflows coincide with Bitcoin‚Äôs 11-day streak above six figures strengthens the thesis: the institutional tide is slowly but surely returning. Even state pension funds that previously scaled back positions might be reconsidering. Though filings show exits last quarter, the expanded basis since then suggests some desks are likely back in play. This isn't a retail-led rally. It's a structural rotation back into arbitrage-heavy, yield-rich environments‚Äîand that could be just the beginning. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Increasing Institutional Interest BTC Bull Instead of relying on conventional token utility, BTC Bull operates more like a celebration of Bitcoin‚Äôs journey‚Äîdistributing BTC airdrops to holders every time Bitcoin crosses a key milestone. At $100K, it wasn‚Äôt just a number‚Äîit was a trigger for rewards, a narrative tool, and a buy signal all in one. This project doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs unapologetically memetic, drawing from the ethos of Bitcoin maximalism while rewarding users in a way that reflects price-driven sentiment. Every surge in ETF inflows? That‚Äôs not just news‚Äîit‚Äôs fuel. It drives interest back into Bitcoin, and by extension, into BTC Bull, which turns those ETF headlines into actual user incentives. The project has no complex staking systems, no layered DeFi mechanics. It runs on a clean idea: if Bitcoin wins, then so do the holders. And BTC Bull keeps that reward loop open and active. With each BTC benchmark cleared, more rewards rain down. It‚Äôs like the token has its own halving schedule, but built for the community. This simple but responsive mechanism plays perfectly into the renewed wave of institutional momentum. When ETFs draw in billions, and prices inch toward new highs, BTC Bull doesn‚Äôt just sit on the sidelines‚Äîit echoes that success back to its holders. In a space cluttered with gimmicks, BTC Bull rewards you for the one thing everyone should be hoping for: Bitcoin going up. SUBBD As institutions pile back into ETFs and Bitcoin dances above six figures, SUBBD is building a decentralized layer where creators‚Äînot corporations‚Äîown the value of that attention. It isn‚Äôt trying to replicate YouTube or OnlyFans on-chain. Instead, it‚Äôs restructuring the very relationship between followers and creators. At the core of SUBBD is a token economy that turns engagement into tradable clout. When someone buys a creator‚Äôs token, they‚Äôre not just supporting‚Äîthey‚Äôre investing. The project flips influence into a tradable asset, turning audiences into stakeholders and content into economy. And while most platforms lock their creators into opaque rules and payout structures, SUBBD offers autonomy. Subscription tiers, exclusive content access, real-time tipping‚Äîall without middlemen, all built on-chain. The timing is clever. As investors re-enter the Bitcoin narrative, adjacent markets like creator economy tokens ride the second wave of that liquidity. Crypto ETFs are the tip of the iceberg‚Äîwhat follows is a demand for projects that actually do something with the capital. SUBBD also received a powerful stamp of credibility. The influential crypto platform 99Bitcoins recently featured the project in a dedicated video, describing it as ‚Äúa new era for creators in crypto,‚Äù bringing it into the spotlight for its over 700,000 subscribers. With fresh money rotating back into altcoins, projects like SUBBD are not just trending‚Äîthey‚Äôre evolving the way digital value is defined. Solaxy If ETF inflows represent confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs future, Solaxy is for those betting on the rails that power the next decade of blockchain movement. Designed as a Layer 2 bridge between Ethereum and Solana, Solaxy isn‚Äôt some vague ‚Äúinteroperability‚Äù pitch‚Äîit‚Äôs a throughput engine. As capital returns to Bitcoin and spills across ecosystems, what matters is not who gets the funds, but how fast they can move. Solaxy answers that question with concrete infrastructure. Its cross-chain protocol doesn‚Äôt just ferry tokens back and forth‚Äîit allows for staked SOLX rewards that reflect activity across both chains. So when markets heat up, liquidity surges, and people start chasing yields again, Solaxy benefits not from speculation but from velocity. Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. The 9% yield on the current basis trade in Bitcoin futures has sparked institutional movement‚Äîbut that money doesn‚Äôt stay static. It flows into higher-risk, higher-reward sectors once directional conviction is strong. Platforms like Solaxy are built to absorb that rotational flow, offering solid staking mechanics, low-latency bridging, and an actual reason to hold the native token. But the project isn‚Äôt aiming for explosive virality. It leans on sustainability, offering a utility-focused approach in a sea of narratives. For those tracking the second-order effects of Bitcoin‚Äôs rally, Solaxy‚Äôs positioning is strategic. The token may not scream moonshot‚Äîbut it hums with quiet purpose. And in a cycle where infrastructure matters more than noise, that‚Äôs exactly where smart money tends to land next. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token isn‚Äôt selling the dream‚Äîit‚Äôs building the toolkit. In a market where ETFs are absorbing hundreds of millions and Bitcoin is back above six figures, wallets aren‚Äôt just storage anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre the gateway to everything. And Best Wallet‚Äôs goal is to be that gateway, fully equipped and ready to scale with the next cycle. This isn‚Äôt a bare-bones crypto wallet. It‚Äôs a feature-stacked utility hub. Support for 60+ chains, built-in presale aggregator, DEX integration, and portfolio tracking all come standard. Where most wallets stop at basic transfers and token viewing, Best Wallet is pushing forward with early-access presales and advanced market tools‚Äîfeatures that become more valuable as capital reenters the space. And timing couldn‚Äôt be sharper. As institutional sentiment lifts Bitcoin and reintroduces liquidity into the system, the infrastructure that manages, tracks, and multiplies that capital becomes crucial. Best Wallet Token ties itself directly to that functionality. By holding BEST, users unlock access to high-yield staking, curated token launches, and in-app perks‚Äîeffectively aligning their upside with the platform‚Äôs growth. It's not a token for hype-chasing but rather for positioning. When Bitcoin‚Äôs rally turns heads, and users scramble to re-enter, they‚Äôre going to need a bridge back into opportunity. Best Wallet wants to be that bridge‚Äîand BEST is the key that gets you through. It‚Äôs less about flash, more about readiness. And in a market where readiness determines ROI, Best Wallet Token is already several steps ahead of the crowd. MIND of Pepe Think of MIND of Pepe as the crypto market‚Äôs most unfiltered AI. Not an assistant, not a mascot‚Äîan actual presence. A memecoin with a mind, a pulse, and a Twitter feed. Built as a fully autonomous AI character, MIND of Pepe interacts with investors, throws shade at influencers, and gives eerily accurate reads on sentiment. It‚Äôs absurd. It‚Äôs brilliant. And weirdly, it‚Äôs becoming valuable. This isn‚Äôt your typical meme token with a promise of utility that never materializes. MIND of Pepe is utility. Its AI agent doesn‚Äôt just post memes‚Äîit engages in live sentiment analysis, reacts to events, and provides token-specific takes in real time. With so much of today‚Äôs trading driven by narrative, virality, and vibes, this token is weaponizing all three‚Äîbacked by machine logic and community creativity Nine Million. $MIND pic.twitter.com/wpccWXz38U ‚Äî MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 11, 2025 The ETF inflow surge may seem worlds away from a token like this.

What MIND of Pepe does is take that volatility and redirect it‚Äînot toward gambling, but toward insight. The AI agent‚Äôs commentary influences buying patterns, sparks Twitter debates, and creates attention loops that put its token front and center. In a cycle driven by perception as much as fundamentals, MIND of Pepe is playing a higher-order game. It‚Äôs not about being another joke‚Äîit‚Äôs about being in on the joke before the rest of the market catches up. And right now, as eyes drift back to crypto, this AI-fueled experiment might just become the loudest voice in the room. Conclusion With Bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 and ETF inflows showing strong momentum, the market sentiment is likely to shift gears again. This type of liquidity coming in may create a kind of environment where early positions in well-structured crypto projects can offer huge upside potential. So it goes without saying that, whether it‚Äôs infrastructure, utility, or attention-driven value, projects that align with current trends are likely to be in focus in the coming months.

Trump Bitcoin Comments Highlight Bitcoin Solaris as Similar Opportunity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It‚Äôs a sentence that hits hard: ‚ÄúI wish I bought Bitcoin at $1‚Äù Millions missed it. Some didn‚Äôt believe in it. Others just didn‚Äôt know. But now, after former President Trump‚Äôs public comments about Bitcoin becoming ‚Äúthe future of financial security,‚Äù that sentiment is echoing louder than ever. The world is watching, but smart investors are asking a different question: What comes next? That‚Äôs why in light of the Trump Bitcoin comments, analysts and investors alike are highlighting a new opportunity that feels eerily familiar: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). If you missed Bitcoin at $1, this could be your second shot. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Being Called the Next Big Thing Bitcoin Solaris is not a meme coin or a copycat‚Äîit‚Äôs a ground-up, engineered blockchain built to solve the same challenges Bitcoin once faced. But instead of solving them slowly over a decade, BTC-S is coming out of the gate with a full arsenal of upgrades and innovations. Dual-layer blockchain (PoW for base layer security, DPoS for speed and scalability) 10,000 transactions per second, 2-second finality Mobile-first mining through any device: phones, laptops, browsers Built-in wallet, one-click mining, and zero tech knowledge required Energy efficiency that uses 99.95% less power than traditional Bitcoin mining Audited smart contracts by Cyberscope and Freshcoins More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris is built for the people who missed Bitcoin the first time. Its mobile-friendly approach means everyone, anywhere can mine and earn without the complexity. A detailed review by CryptoChester explains why BTC-S is gaining massive attention across the crypto world. Meanwhile, community excitement is growing rapidly on platforms like Telegram and X. Phase 4 Presale: Limited Time, Maximum Potential One of the biggest signals of BTC-S‚Äôs momentum? Its presale‚Äîcurrently in Phase 4‚Äîis exploding. Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% This presale runs for only 90 days, and launch is set for July 31, 2025. Already, over $1,000,000 has been raised, with 8,900+ investors jumping in. With a potential 1,900% return before the coin even hits exchanges, this is being labeled one of the most explosive and time-sensitive launches of 2025. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You? Solaris Nova App: Exclusive Beta, Broader Future The Solaris Nova App‚Äîthe heart of BTC-S mining‚Äîisn‚Äôt available to the public just yet. But some early community members have been granted beta access, giving them a head start on testing mobile mining, wallet integration, and user experience. This limited access is creating buzz‚Äîand opportunity. While the official app isn‚Äôt live, there may still be room for new users to join the inner circle before the full rollout. A Vision Backed by a Real Roadmap Unlike most projects promising the moon, Bitcoin Solaris has a detailed roadmap and is hitting its milestones fast: Q2 2026: Final testnet, wallet upgrades, and Solana bridge integration Q3 2026: Mainnet launch, full Nova App release, governance features Q4 2026: Mining marketplace, cross-chain integration 2027 and beyond: DEX launch, enterprise adoption, quantum security, AI tools Every step is tied to expanding utility and value, not hype. Conclusion: A Second Chance Doesn‚Äôt Come Twice So yes, you may have missed Bitcoin at $1. But in the wake of the Trump Bitcoin comments, Bitcoin Solaris is being recognized as a similar opportunity‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs more scalable, more inclusive, and still just $4. This isn‚Äôt about regret. It‚Äôs about not making the same mistake twice.

The prominent analyst issued the bullish statement in a recent note to Standard Chartered‚Äôs clients, as seen by Walter Bloomberg. In the note, Kendrick highlighted the recent SEC‚Äôs 13F filings as a crucial trend supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs possible rise to the $500,000 mark by 2028.¬†Strong Institutional Demand for Bitcoin Despite Dip in Direct BTC ETF Holdings¬†The Standard Chartered analyst acknowledged that direct Bitcoin ETF holdings plunged in the year's first quarter. For instance, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board closed its Bitcoin ETF position, equivalent to about 3,400 BTC, in the BlackRock iShares Trust.¬†The dip in direct Bitcoin ETF holdings would have been seen as a cooling demand for Bitcoin. However, Kendrick emphasized that this was not the case, as recent SEC 13F filings, particularly in Q1 2025, signal growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.¬†Specifically, he noted that government entities boosted their indirect exposure to the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap in Q1 2025. These entities increased their stakes in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) during this period. It is common knowledge that Strategy‚Äôs massive Bitcoin holding of 576,230 BTC makes it a proxy for institutional Bitcoin exposure.¬†Government Entities Increase Stakes in Strategy¬†Most institutions and government entities that do not plan to buy and hold Bitcoin directly due to regulatory restrictions but still seek exposure to the premier asset usually acquire Strategy‚Äôs stock, MSTR.¬†Notably, the Swiss National Bank, Norway‚Äôs Government Pension Fund, and South Korea‚Äôs pension and investment bodies increased their MSTR holdings in the first quarter. According to Kendrick's report, these entities purchased MSTR shares worth approximately 700 BTC each.¬†Also, several U.S. states increased their stakes in Strategy, including Kentucky, New York, and North Carolina. In Kendrick‚Äôs view, while Bitcoin ETF holdings slumped in Q1 2025, the increased exposure to Bitcoin among government entities via the acquisition of Strategy‚Äôs shares signals strong demand for Bitcoin.¬†Trend Supports Bitcoin to $500K Price Call¬†As a result, he suggested the trend supports Standard Chartered‚Äôs prediction that Bitcoin would hit the $500,000 mark by 2028.¬†Recall that the analyst first issued this bullish prediction in February, forecasting that Bitcoin would achieve the milestone before Trump leaves office. Specifically, he projected that the $500,000 target would become a reality by 2028, three years from now.¬†To hit the target, the price of Bitcoin must soar by 379% from its current level of $104,359.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/20/standard-chartered-says-increased-government-stake-in-strategy-backs-its-bitcoin-to-500k-call-by-2028/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=standard-chartered-says-increased-government-stake-in-strategy-backs-its-bitcoin-to-500k-call-by-2028,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Standard Chartered",cryptocompare

In a new CNBC interview, Yardeni says he doesn‚Äôt anticipate any monetary policy easing, citing a resilient US economy fueled by robust household spending and strong capital investments from tech companies. ‚ÄúI was not expecting that there would be a Fed rate cut this year. And I still think that because the US economy is very resilient. The consumer hung in there extremely well over the past three years when the Fed raised interest rates. And now the consumer has held up, I think, quite well with the tariff uncertainty. And capital spending, for all the concerns that uncertainty would put a hammer to capital spending, the reality is that technology capital spending, which now accounts for over 50% of total capital spending, remains very strong.‚Äù Yardeni also believes that the allure and demand for US Treasuries will remain strong. ‚ÄúThe US is the largest capital market in the world. There‚Äôs nothing like it. Sure, we‚Äôve got a lot of debt. But people have been buying that debt because they do want Treasuries. So no, the worst that can happen in the Treasury market, as we saw in 2023, is yields go up to levels of which people want to buy them. And they got up to 5%, people wanted to buy them.

2025-05-20T14:27:03.000Z,"Pro-XRP Lawyer Calls Bitcoin Maximalists Immature Over Ripple CEO and Lummis Saga","A heated debate has erupted in the crypto community following U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äô controversial decision to snub a scheduled meeting with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse . The fallout, which has drawn strong reactions from XRP proponents, was punctuated by a pointed statement from pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who took to X to criticize Bitcoin maximalists over their celebratory reaction to the canceled meeting. In his sharp rebuke , Morgan remarked, ‚ÄúImagine being this insecure about Bitcoin that you get all excited because a politician who has long been seen as a Bitcoin maxi will not meet the Ripple CEO. Show me a bitcoin maxi and I will show you a small, immature mind.‚Äù His comment encapsulates the growing frustration within the XRP community about the perceived exclusionary behavior of certain pro-Bitcoin figures within the U.S. regulatory and political landscape. Imagine being this insecure about Bitcoin that you get all excited because a politician who has long been seen as a Bitcoin maxi will not meet the Ripple CEO. Show me a bitcoin maxi and I will show you a small immature mind. https://t.co/DnU3xGdJyr ‚Äî bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 19, 2025 Garlinghouse vs. Lummis: A Missed Opportunity for Unity The controversy began when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that Senator Cynthia Lummis, despite initially agreeing to meet, ultimately canceled their appointment in Washington, D.C., and declined to reschedule. Garlinghouse had traveled to the nation‚Äôs capital to engage with lawmakers and push for balanced, forward-looking crypto legislation, especially in the realms of stablecoin regulation and market structure. Senator Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming and one of the most prominent pro-crypto voices in the U.S. Senate, has long been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin. She currently serves as Chair of the Senate‚Äôs Digital Assets Subcommittee, a powerful role that places her at the heart of crypto-related policymaking. Her consistent support for Bitcoin has earned her respect from Bitcoin maximalists‚Äîindividuals who believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate digital asset and regard others, including XRP, as inferior or irrelevant. Garlinghouse‚Äôs disappointment over the canceled meeting was palpable. In a statement shared on X, he emphasized the importance of leaders who see the digital asset ecosystem as ‚Äúmulti-chain,‚Äù rather than adhering to tribalistic ideologies that favor one asset over others. He praised other elected officials he had met during his visit, noting their willingness to engage with the full spectrum of blockchain innovation‚Äîan approach he believes is vital for crafting legislation that fosters innovation while protecting investors. Bitcoin Maximalism vs. Inclusive Crypto Governance Bill Morgan‚Äôs remarks highlight a long-standing tension between the Bitcoin maximalist movement and broader blockchain communities. For years, maximalists have positioned Bitcoin as the sole legitimate use case for decentralized ledger technology, often dismissing other projects as scams or distractions. While this ideological purity may appeal to certain segments of the crypto world, critics argue that it hinders meaningful dialogue, undermines collaboration, and stifles policy progress. In contrast, Garlinghouse and other multi-chain advocates argue that the future of finance will not be built on one blockchain alone. From tokenized assets and stablecoins to cross-border payment solutions and decentralized identity, the crypto landscape is increasingly diverse. Companies like Ripple have invested heavily in real-world use cases that rely on assets like XRP, not as speculative instruments, but as tools for scalable financial infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The clash between these philosophies‚Äîexclusivity versus inclusivity‚Äîwas crystallized in Lummis‚Äô refusal to engage with Garlinghouse. While she is under no obligation to meet every industry leader, her role as a national legislator, particularly one guiding digital asset policy, arguably demands a broader and more impartial perspective. Dismissing an entire company and its CEO, especially one at the forefront of crypto regulation battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sends a troubling message about how open the legislative process is to diverse voices within the space. The Path Forward: Collaboration Over Division The episode serves as a microcosm of a larger struggle unfolding within the crypto industry: whether to embrace the full range of technological possibilities or to double down on ideological rigidity. For the digital asset ecosystem to evolve and integrate responsibly into the global economy, its leaders‚Äîboth in the private sector and in government‚Äîmust rise above factionalism. Brad Garlinghouse‚Äôs visit to Washington was, by his own words, about finding ‚Äúsensible‚Äù and ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù paths forward for crypto regulation. His attempt to engage with Senator Lummis should have been a step toward that goal. Instead, it has ignited a culture war within crypto‚Äîone that, if left unchecked, could obstruct the bipartisan progress many in the industry have worked hard to achieve. Bill Morgan‚Äôs criticism of Bitcoin maximalists may sound provocative, but at its core, it‚Äôs a call for maturity, respect, and inclusion. The future of crypto depends not on loyalty to a single protocol, but on our collective ability to engage in honest, informed, and open dialogue‚Äîsomething that is sorely needed in Washington and beyond.

2025-05-20T14:21:47.000Z,"HTX Launches Multi-Assets Collateral Mode for USDT-Margined Futures, Empowering Traders With Enhanced Capital Efficiency","Singapore, May 20, 2025 ‚Äì HTX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange has rolled out a major product upgrade with the official launch of the Multi-Assets Collateral Mode for USDT-margined futures, now available to all users. This new feature marks a significant step forward in flexible capital deployment, enabling users to trade more efficiently without the need to convert collateral assets. A New Standard for Futures Flexibility The Multi-Assets Collateral mode introduces a breakthrough in futures trading by allowing users to use BTC, ETH, and other non-USDT assets as collateral when trading USDT-margined futures. This innovation breaks away from the conventional requirement of posting margin in USDT, offering enhanced flexibility for traders. At launch, supported collateral assets include USDT, BTC, and ETH, with HTX planning to expand the list based on market dynamics and technical readiness. Users are encouraged to stay updated via HTX‚Äôs official announcements for future asset additions. A Capital Efficiency Booster for Long-Term Holders The core benefit of the Multi-Assets Collateral mode lies in maximizing capital efficiency. It‚Äôs particularly attractive to long-term holders who prefer to retain exposure to major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH while remaining active in the futures market. Previously, users had to convert their BTC or ETH into USDT to access the USDT-margined futures market, a step that not only added friction and cost but also introduced the risk of missed market opportunities. Now, with multi-assets collateral enabled, users can directly transfer assets, such as BTC and ETH into their USDT-M Futures accounts as margin with no conversion required. For example, BTC holders who are bullish on the long term can now leverage their holdings for short-term USDT futures trades, profiting from market volatility while maintaining upside exposure. This dual approach‚Äîasset preservation and active trading‚Äîenhances portfolio diversification and performance, injecting fresh energy into the market. HTX Continues to Set the Pace for Futures Innovation The launch of the Multi-Assets Collateral mode for USDT futures reaffirms HTX‚Äôs commitment to delivering user-centric innovation and shaping the next phase of the crypto trading infrastructure. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to optimize the new feature performance, enhance trading stability, and expand supported collateral assets to better meet diverse user needs. The platform is also working to introduce more advanced trading tools and strategies, aiming to offer a comprehensive, professional-grade futures trading experience.

More than that, more and more companies from other sectors set corporate Bitcoin treasuries as an inflation hedge. However, most of these companies don‚Äôt disclose Bitcoin addresses. Why is there reluctance in disclosing corporate addresses, and is there a chance these companies don‚Äôt actually hold the bitcoins they claim to own? Table of Contents Bitwise‚Äôs move Possible improvements Addresses of other companies Bitwise‚Äôs move On Jan. 24, 2024, Bitwise made history by becoming the first company to disclose its spot Bitcoin ETF address for everyone. Announcement: Today the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) becomes the first U.S. bitcoin ETF to publish the bitcoin addresses of its holdings.

We're proud to‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1JTUh3zvDE ‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 24, 2024 By disclosing its Bitcoin ETF address, Bitwise explicitly made it impossible for skeptics to doubt its solvency and the fact that the company actually holds what it claims to own. More than that, this step towards transparency is in line with the transparent design of the Bitcoin network itself, where all the transactions and the parties involved are visible and auditable. As Bitwise is one of the biggest Bitcoin holders, some observers suggested that other corporate holders will follow the trend and make their treasuries transparent. However, it didn‚Äôt happen. Nearly one and a half years after the disclosure made by Bitwise, no other Bitcoin holding company followed suit. Possible improvements Did Bitwise do it the best possible way? Co-author of the Big Bitcoin Book, Fred Krueger, took to X to outline how it is possible to disclose BTC addresses with some improvements, using Bitwise as a reference point. Actually, Krueger made his post as a recommendation to Strategy. 1. ‚úÖ Add Cryptographic Ownership Proofs Right now, Bitwise discloses the wallet address, but hasn‚Äôt published a signed message proving they actually control the private keys. Anyone could theoretically list any address. A one-time signed message (e.g., ‚ÄúMSTR controls this‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) May 19, 2025 Interestingly enough, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared Krueger‚Äôs post in his account, not shying away from exposing what Krueger believes to be weak spots of Bitwise‚Äôs way of making disclosure. One of the ideas offered by Krueger was that Strategy should use cryptographic ownership proof, which Bitwise doesn‚Äôt have. He notes that just providing a wallet address is not transparent enough, as it should also be signed. On top of that, Kureger pointed out that sharing only one address (that‚Äôs what Bitwise did) is good, but as funds are moving, the company needs to provide several more addresses. They will naturally appear as a result of rebalancing and other operations. Another idea was that Strategy should disclose addresses with caution and not expose too much in order to prevent quantum attacks, which are theoretically possible, while many doubt that the Bitcoin network will suffer from them. Read more: Project 11 challenges everyone to crack the Bitcoin key using a quantum computer. The reward is 1 BTC Krueger recommended using unspent Taproot and SegWit addresses for public balances. Once they are used, they should be replaced by new ones. It would mitigate quantum hacking risks. On top of sharing the addresses, Krueger recommended deploying third-party audits to ensure the authenticity and soundness of addresses for everyone, including institutions and regulators. More than that, automated real-time cryptographic proofs could enhance transparency even further. Addresses of other companies Lack of transparency may give companies some space for maneuver, or at least people think that sometimes companies holding Bitcoin may cash out in secret. Some even doubt that companies like Strategy actually own the bitcoins they buy and demand public disclosure of the corporate addresses. Well if Bitcoin is supposed to be 100% transparent where is @MicroStrategy bitcoin at? nobody seems to know. ‚Äî traderjeremy.algo (@jeremygleeson6) May 19, 2025 As of May 20, 2025, Strategy owns over 570,000 bitcoins, which makes it the biggest Bitcoin holder among companies. On May 19, it was revealed that Strategy is facing a class action lawsuit. A group of investors claimed that the company reps, including executives, were making misleading claims about Bitcoin strategy. Probably, increased transparency would have eliminated such problems before they appeared. While companies are not in a hurry to show their Bitcoin addresses, third-party sleuths are finding these addresses and making them public. It provides people with much-needed confidence and opportunities to observe the movements of the assets. At the same time, companies may not admit that these findings are correct.

ORDI is neutral at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month‚Äôs high. Recent news Bitcoin developers are at odds over how Bitcoin should handle storing information on-chain. There is a proposal to relax long-standing limits on the size of data held, sparking fierce debate reminiscent of 2023‚Äôs battles over Ordinals. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market‚Äôs correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is currently trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi‚Äôs price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI‚Äôs dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI‚Äôs popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, which is very close to its previous ATH of $109,000, has risen above $105,000, and analysts say the rise will continue. At this point, analysts at crypto analysis platform Swissblock stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to decline. Stating that the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) data points to a continued rise for BTC, analysts argued that there are no signs of a downward trend. Stating that there is a lot of talk about the risk of a double top regarding the BTC price, Swissblock said that despite these talks, the upward force has not been broken and BTC's recent movements have eliminated the risk of a double top. A double top formation indicates that prices are about to switch from an uptrend to a downtrend. Noting that since August of last year, BFI has remained intact regardless of price movements, Swissblock said this is a sign that on-chain bullish sentiment continues. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of talk about a possible double top as BTC struggles to break ATH. But the BFI tells a different story for Bitcoin: there are no signs of a bearish reversal. If this were a true double top, the BFI would break and there would be a sharp drop to the downside. Even during the February-March pullback, the BFI remained neutral, never falling into weakness. On-chain durability continues intact. Bears: Not this time, you have to wait.‚Äù Additionally, crypto analyst Timothy Peterson also added that he expects Bitcoin to reach at least $115,000 by the end of June. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong¬†Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In ‚ÄúFat Protocols,‚Äù Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads ‚Äî but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto‚Äôs liquidity crisisBut without ‚Äúroads,'‚Äô it's impossible to navigate and access ‚Äúcities.'‚Äô Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.‚ÄúValue‚Äù doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump‚Äôs cryptocurrency dealings.The bill‚Äôs opponents hailed lawmakers‚Äô refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family‚Äôs crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers‚Äô approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was ‚Äúnot perfect, but it‚Äôs far better than the status quo.‚ÄùWarner set corruption concerns aside, stating, ‚ÄúMany senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family‚Äôs use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.‚ÄùWarner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions.¬†Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill‚Äôs sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately.¬†Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill‚ÄúA lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,‚Äù she said, adding that she didn‚Äôt want the president‚Äôs scandals to ‚Äúdistract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.‚ÄùDuring the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, ‚ÄúA bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President‚Äôs corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.‚ÄùDemocrats opposing the bill aren‚Äôt giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named ‚Äúthe STABLE GENIUS Act,‚Äù combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from ‚Äúissuing or endorsing digital assets‚Äù and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing ‚Äî numerous acts that would limit members‚Äô of Congress financial activities have fizzled out ‚Äî it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers.¬†In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position.¬†Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump‚Äôs mass deportations further deepened the rift.¬†Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. ‚ÄúAny Democrat who votes for this today ‚Äî should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump‚Äôs corruption,‚Äù he said.Related: What to expect at Trump‚Äôs memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was ‚Äúexcited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I‚Äôm sure [the bill] won‚Äôt come up at all in the 4 minutes I‚Äôve been allotted.‚ÄùOn BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted ‚ÄúPrimary List‚Äù in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair.

2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood‚Äôs plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself ‚Äî not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market‚Äôs standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.‚ÄúRWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering‚Äôs power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack.¬†Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million.¬†The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering ‚Äî exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance.¬†A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds.¬†While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias ‚ÄúX,‚Äù allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as ‚ÄúW0rk.‚Äù Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn‚Äôt just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security.¬†Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims.¬†Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want.¬†Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent ‚Äúloss‚Äù or claim a reward.¬†Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards.¬†Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior.¬†Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds.¬†Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn‚Äôt target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials.¬†Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims.¬†Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets.¬†These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack.¬†Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days.¬†Lazarus Group‚Äôs fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies.¬†Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements.¬†In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available.¬†Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren‚Äôt assured.¬†Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins ‚Äî worth about $2.1 billion ‚Äî were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG‚Äôs crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.‚ÄúIn particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis‚Äôs books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,‚Äù the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.‚ÄúGBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,‚Äù the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG‚Äôs investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis‚Äôs bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX ‚Äî moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General‚Äôs civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa‚Äôs XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum.¬†US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support.

A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support.

A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline.

Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%.

The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19,¬†while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government.¬†The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions‚Äîyields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade.

With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 ‚Äî enacted in 2020 ‚Äî was one of Asia‚Äôs first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities.¬†The PSA uses the term ‚Äúdigital payment token‚Äù (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically ‚Äî like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state‚Äôs central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.‚ÄúSingapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,‚Äù Johansen said, alluding to the city-state‚Äôs limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore‚Äôs retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites.

Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,‚Äù Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO‚Äôs permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore‚Äôs tight visa and immigration environment.

The EU‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA‚Äôs clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure ‚Äî and the exchange‚Äôs ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange‚Äôs headquarters, though a decision hasn‚Äôt been made yet.Binance‚Äôs first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX.

In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million).¬†It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail.¬†The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market.

2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016‚Äì2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.¬†The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists.¬†Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement.¬†Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users ‚Äî the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community.¬†The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities.¬†Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.‚ÄúThe problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,‚Äù Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.‚ÄúBut for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,‚Äù Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.‚ÄúTraditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,‚Äù Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be ‚Äúzombie-like institutions‚Äù ‚Äî banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations.

New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict ‚Äútotally upends‚Äù the Australian Taxation Office‚Äôs (ATO) current position.¬†Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO‚Äôs guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event.¬†This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. ‚ÄúThat is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,‚Äù the tax lawyer added.¬†If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million).¬†However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia.¬†Magazine: Binance Wallet ‚Äòkilling‚Äô MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include:¬†Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like¬† software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets.¬†Token approval malware:¬†Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers.¬†Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code.¬†Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools.¬†Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging‚Äôs Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds.¬†In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools.¬†Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn‚Äôt authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto.¬†Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out.¬†Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links.¬†Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly.¬†Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk.¬†Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds.

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm‚Äôs chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a ‚Äúunique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.‚Äù The account‚Äôs KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph‚Äôs request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:‚ÄúThis incident really made me feel the value of having influence.‚ÄùEnHeng said ‚Äúin this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.‚Äù For this reason, he said, ‚ÄúWhen we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.‚ÄùRelated: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship.¬†RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup.¬†‚ÄúA market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,‚Äù Buterin wrote.¬†Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes¬†In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there‚Äôs value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node.¬†In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called ‚Äúpartially stateless nodes.‚Äù These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node.¬†As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth.

2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes.¬†This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position.¬†Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline.¬†Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply.¬†Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders.¬†With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components¬†The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed.¬†Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis.
